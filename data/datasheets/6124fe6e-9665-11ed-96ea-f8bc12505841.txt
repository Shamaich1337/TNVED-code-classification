A high switching \nfrequency of typically 2.5 MHz allows the use of small \ninductors and provides fast transient response by use \nof the DCS-Control topology.\nWith their wide operating input voltage range of 3 V \nto 17 V, the devices are ideally suited for systems \npowered from either a Li-Ion or other batteries, as well \nas from 12-V intermediate power rails. It supports up \nto 2 A of continuous output current at output voltages \nbetween 0.9 V and 6 V (with 100% duty-cycle mode). \nThe output voltage start-up ramp is controlled by \nthe soft-start pin, which allows operation as either a \nstandalone power supply or in tracking configurations. \nPower sequencing is also possible by configuring the \nEnable (EN) and open-drain Power Good (PG) pins.\nIn power save mode, the devices draw quiescent \ncurrent of about 17 μA from VIN. Power Save Mode, \nentered automatically and seamlessly if the load is \nsmall, maintains high efficiency over the entire load \nrange. In Shutdown Mode, the device is turned off and \ncurrent consumption is less than 2 μA.\nThe device, available in adjustable and fixed output \nvoltage versions, is packaged in a 16-pin VQFN \npackage measuring 3 mm × 3 mm (RGT).\nDevice Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS6214x VQFN (16) 3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\n22 uF1.8 V / 2 A\n10 \x1dF2.2 \x1dH\n(3 .. 17) V\n3.3 nFTPS62141100 kPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGND\nTypical Application Schematic\n405060708090100\n0.0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 2.0VIN=5V VIN=12V VIN=17V\nOutput Current (A)Efficiency (%)\nVOUT=3.3V\nfsw=1.25MHz\nG001 \nEfficiency vs Output CurrentTPS62140 , TPS62140A , TPS62141 , TPS62142 , TPS62143\nSLVSAJ0F  – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

This control loop takes information about output voltage changes and feeds it directly to a fast \ncomparator stage. It sets the switching frequency, which is constant for steady-state operating conditions, and \nprovides immediate response to dynamic load changes. To get accurate DC load regulation, a voltage feedback \nloop is used. The internally compensated regulation network achieves fast and stable operation with small \nexternal components and low-ESR capacitors.\nThe DCS-Control topology supports Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) mode for medium and heavy load \nconditions and Power Save Mode at light loads. During PWM, it operates at its nominal switching frequency in \ncontinuous conduction mode. This frequency is typically about 2.5 MHz or 1.25 MHz with a controlled frequency \nvariation depending on the input voltage. If the load current decreases, the converter enters Power Save Mode \nto sustain high efficiency down to very light loads. In Power Save Mode, the switching frequency decreases \nlinearly with the load current. Because DCS-Control supports both operation modes within one single building \nblock, the transition from PWM to Power Save Mode is seamless without effects on the output voltage.\nFixed output-voltage versions provide the smallest solution size and lowest current consumption, requiring only \nthree external components. An internal current limit supports nominal output currents of up to 2 A.\nThe TPS6214x family offers both excellent DC voltage and superior load transient regulation, combined with \nvery low output voltage ripple, minimizing interference with RF circuits.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagrams\nDCS - ControlTMcontrol logicSoft\nstartThermal\nShtdwnUVLO PG control\npower\ncontrol\nerror\namplifiergate driveHS lim\nLS limPVIN PVIN AVIN PG\nPGND PGND AGNDcomp\ncomp\n+_\ntimer t ONdirect control &\ncompensation\ncomparatorrampFSW*\nFBEN*\nSS/TR\nDEF*\nVOSSW\nSW\nSW\n* This pin is connected to a pull down resistor internally (see Section 8.3)\nFigure 8-1.

TPS62141/2/3 (Fixed Output Voltage)\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Enable/Shutdown (EN)\nWhen Enable (EN) is set High, the device starts operation. Shutdown is forced if EN is pulled Low with a \nshutdown current of typically 1.5 µA. During shutdown, the internal power MOSFETs and entire control circuitry \nare turned off. The internal resistive divider pulls down the output voltage smoothly. The EN signal must be set \nexternally to High or Low. An internal pulldown resistor of about 400 k Ω is connected and keeps EN logic low if \nLow is set initially and then the pin gets floating. It is disconnected if the pin is set High.\nConnecting the EN pin to an appropriate output signal of another power rail provides sequencing of multiple \npower rails.\n8.3.2 Soft-Start/Tracking (SS/TR)\nThe internal soft-start circuitry controls the output voltage slope during start-up. This avoids excessive inrush \ncurrent and ensures a controlled output-voltage rise time. It also prevents unwanted voltage drops from high-\nimpedance power sources or batteries. When EN is set to start device operation, the device starts switching after \na delay of about 50 µs, and VOUT rises with a slope controlled by an external capacitor connected to the SS/TR \npin. See Figure 9-34  and Figure 9-35  for typical start-up operation.\nUsing a very small capacitor (or leaving SS/TR pin un-connected) provides fastest start-up behavior. There is no \ntheoretical limit for the longest start-up time. The TPS6214x can start into a pre-biased output. During monotonic \npre-biased start-up, both the power MOSFETs are not allowed to turn on until the internal ramp of the device \nsets an output voltage above the pre-bias voltage. As long as the output is below about 0.5 V, a reduced current \nlimit of typically 1.6 A is set internally. If the device is set to shutdown (EN = GND), undervoltage lockout, or \nthermal shutdown, an internal resistor pulls the SS/TR pin down to ensure a proper low level. Returning from \nthose states causes a new start-up sequence as set by the SS/TR connection.\nA voltage supplied to SS/TR can be used for tracking a primary voltage. The output voltage follows this voltage \nin both directions, up and down (see Section 9).TPS62140, TPS62140A, TPS62141, TPS62142, TPS62143\nSLVSAJ0F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n8 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62140  TPS62140A  TPS62141  TPS62142  TPS62143\n8.3.3 Power Good (PG)\nThe TPS6214x has a built-in power-good (PG) function to indicate whether the output voltage has reached its \nappropriate level or not. The PG signal can be used for start-up sequencing of multiple rails. The PG pin is an \nopen-drain output that requires a pullup resistor (to any voltage below 7 V). It can sink 2 mA of current and \nmaintain its specified logic-low level. With the TPS62140, it is high-impedance when the device is turned off due \nto EN, UVLO, or thermal shutdown. The TPS62140A features PG = Low in this case and can be used to actively \ndischarge VOUT (see Figure 9-41 ). VIN must remain present for the PG pin to stay Low. See TPS62130A \nDifferences to TPS62130 Application Report  for application details. If not used, the PG pin should be connected \nto GND but may be left floating.\nTable 8-1.

When DEF is Low, the device regulates to the nominal output voltage. Increasing the nominal \nvoltage allows adapting the power supply voltage to the variations of the application hardware. More detailed \ninformation on voltage margining using the TPS6214x can be found in Voltage Margining Using the TPS62130 \nApplication Report . A pulldown resistor of about 400 kΩ is internally connected to the pin, ensuring a proper logic \nlevel if the pin is high impedance or floating after initially set to Low. The resistor is disconnected if the pin is set \nHigh.\n8.3.5 Frequency Selection (FSW)\nTo get high power density with very small solution size, a high switching frequency allows the use of small \nexternal components for the output filter. However switching losses increase with the switching frequency. If \nefficiency is the key parameter, more than solution size, the switching frequency can be set to half (1.25 MHz \ntyp.) by pulling FSW to high. It is mandatory to start with FSW = low to limit inrush current, which can be \ndone by connecting to VOUT or PG. Running with lower frequency a higher efficiency, but also a higher output \nvoltage ripple, is achieved. Pull FSW to Low for high frequency operation (2.5 MHz typ.). To get low ripple and \nfull output current at the lower switching frequency, it is recommended to use an inductor of at least 2.2 μH. \nThe switching frequency can be changed during operation, if needed. A pulldown resistor of about 400 k Ω is \ninternally connected to the pin, acting the same way as at the DEF pin (see above).\n1Maximum allowed voltage is 7 V. Therefore, it is recommended to connect it to VOUT or PG, not VIN.www.ti.comTPS62140, TPS62140A, TPS62141, TPS62142, TPS62143\nSLVSAJ0F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62140  TPS62140A  TPS62141  TPS62142  TPS62143\n8.3.6 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nIf the input voltage drops, the undervoltage lockout prevents incorrect operation of the device by switching off \nboth the power FETs. The undervoltage lockout threshold is set typically to 2.7 V. The device is fully operational \nfor voltages above the UVLO threshold and turns off if the input voltage trips the threshold. The converter starts \noperation again once the input voltage exceeds the threshold by a hysteresis of typically 200 mV.\n8.3.7 Thermal Shutdown\nThe junction temperature (T J) of the device is monitored by an internal temperature sensor. If T J exceeds 160°C \n(typ.), the device goes into thermal shutdown. Both the high-side and low-side power FETs are turned off and \nPG goes high-impedance. When T J decreases below the hysteresis amount, the converter resumes normal \noperation, beginning with soft start. To avoid unstable conditions, a hysteresis of typically 20°C is implemented \non the thermal shutdown temperature.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Pulse-Width Modulation (PWM) Operation\nThe TPS6214x operates with pulse-width modulation in continuous-conduction mode (CCM) with a nominal \nswitching frequency of 2.5 MHz or 1.25 MHz, selectable with the FSW pin. The frequency variation in PWM is \ncontrolled and depends on V IN, VOUT, and the inductance. The device operates in PWM mode as long the output \ncurrent is higher than half the inductor ripple current. To maintain high efficiency at light loads, the device enters \npower-save mode at the boundary to discontinuous conduction mode (DCM). This happens if the output current \nbecomes smaller than half the inductor ripple current.\n8.4.2 Power Save Mode Operation\nThe TPS6214x enters its built-in power-save mode seamlessly if the load current decreases. This secures a \nhigh efficiency in light-load operation. The device remains in power-save mode as long as the inductor current is \ndiscontinuous.\nIn power-save mode, the switching frequency decreases linearly with the load current, maintaining high \nefficiency. The transition into and out of power-save mode happens within the entire regulation scheme and \nis seamless in both directions.\nTPS6214x includes a fixed-on-time circuit. An estimate for this on-time, in steady-state operation with FSW = \nlow, is:\nspace\nnsVVt\nINOUT\nON 400/c215 /c61\n(1)\nspace\nFor very small output voltages, an absolute minimum on-time of about 80 ns is kept to limit switching losses. The \noperating frequency is thereby reduced from its nominal value, which keeps efficiency high. Also the off-time can \nreach its minimum value at high duty cycles. The output voltage remains regulated in such case. Using t ON, the \ntypical peak inductor current in Power Save Mode can be approximated by:\nspace\nONOUT IN\npeak LPSM tLV VI /c215/c45/c61) (\n) (\n(2)\nWhen V IN decreases to typically 15% above VOUT, the TPS6214x does not enter power-save mode, regardless \nof the load current. The device maintains output regulation in PWM mode.TPS62140, TPS62140A, TPS62141, TPS62142, TPS62143\nSLVSAJ0F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62140  TPS62140A  TPS62141  TPS62142  TPS62143\n8.4.3 100% Duty-Cycle Operation\nThe duty cycle of the buck converter is given by D = VOUT/VIN and increases as the input voltage comes \nclose to the output voltage. In this case, the device starts 100% duty-cycle operation, turning on the high-side \nswitch 100% of the time. The high-side switch stays turned on as long as the output voltage is below the internal \nsetpoint. This allows the conversion of small input-to-output voltage differences, for example, for the longest \noperation time of battery-powered applications. In 100% duty-cycle mode, the low-side FET is switched off.\nThe minimum input voltage to maintain output voltage regulation, depending on the load current and the output \nvoltage level, is calculated as:\nspace\n/c40 /c41L ) on ( DS OUT (min) OUT (min)IN R R I V V /c43 /c43 /c61\n(3)\nwhere\n•IOUT is the output current\n•RDS(on)  is the R DS(on)  of the high-side FET\n•RL is the DC resistance of the inductor used\n8.4.4 Current Limit and Short Circuit Protection\nThe TPS6214x devices are protected against heavy load and short-circuit events. If a short circuit is detected \n(VOUT drops below 0.5 V), the current limit is reduced to 1.6 A, typically. If the output voltage rises above 0.5 \nV, the device runs in normal operation again. At heavy loads, the current limit determines the maximum output \ncurrent. If the current limit is reached, the high-side FET is turned off. Avoiding shoot through current, then the \nlow-side FET switches on to allow the inductor current to decrease. The low-side current limit is typically 2.4 \nA. The high-side FET turns on again only if the current in the low-side FET has decreased below the low-side \ncurrent-limit threshold.\nThe output current of the device is limited by the current limit (see Section 7.5). Due to internal propagation \ndelay, the actual current can exceed the static current limit during that time. The dynamic current limit is \ncalculated as follows:\nspace\nPDL\nLIMF typ peak tLVI I /c215 /c43 /c61) (\n(4)\nwhere\n•ILIMF is the static current limit, specified in Section 7.5\n•L is the inductor value\n•VL is the voltage across the inductor (V IN – V OUT)\n•tPD is the internal propagation delay\nThe current limit can exceed static values, especially if the input voltage is high and very small inductances are \nused.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe TPS62140 is a switched mode step-down converter, able to convert a 3-V to 17-V input voltage into a 0.9-V \nto 6-V output voltage, providing up to 2 A. It needs a minimum amount of external components. Apart from \nthe LC output filter and the input capacitor, only the TPS62140 (TPS62140A) with an adjustable output voltage \nneeds an additional resistive divider to set the output voltage level.\n9.2 Typical Application\nspace\n(3 .. 17) V\nC3\n22 uFVOUT / 2 A\nC1\n10 \x1dF2.2 \x1dH\nC5\n3.3 nFTPS62140R1\nR2100 kPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGND\nFigure 9-1. 3.3-V/2-A Step-Down Converter\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe following design guideline provides a component selection to operate the device within the recommended \noperating conditions. Using the FSW pin, the design can be optimized for highest efficiency or smallest solution \nsize and lowest output voltage ripple. For highest efficiency set FSW = high and the device operates at the lower \nswitching frequency. For smallest solution size and lowest output voltage ripple set FSW = low and the device \noperates with higher switching frequency. The typical values for all measurements are V IN = 12 V, V OUT = 3.3 V, \nand T = 25°C, using the external components of Table 9-1 .\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nThe component selection used for measurements is given as follows:\nTable 9-1.

For fixed output versions, the FB pin is pulled down \ninternally and can be left floating. It is recommended to connect to AGND to improve thermal resistance. The \nadjustable version can be programmed for output voltages from 0.9 V to 6 V by using a resistive divider \nfrom VOUT to AGND. The voltage at the FB pin is regulated to 800 mV. The value of the output voltage \nis set by the selection of the resistive divider from Equation 6 . It is recommended to choose resistor values \nwhich allow a current of at least 2 µA, meaning the value of R2 should not exceed 400 k Ω. Lower resistor \nvalues are recommended for highest accuracy and most-robust design. For applications requiring lowest current \nconsumption, the use of fixed output-voltage versions is recommended.\nspacing\n/c247\n/c248/c246/c231\n/c232/c230/c45 /c61 10.8VVR ROUT\n2 1\n(6)\nspacing\nIn case the FB pin is opened, the device clamps the output voltage at the VOS pin internally to about 7.4 V.\n9.2.2.2 External Component Selection\nThe external components have to fulfill the needs of the application, but also the stability criteria of the devices \ncontrol loop. The TPS6214x is optimized to work within a range of external components. The inductance of \nthe LC output filter and capacitance have to be considered in conjunction, creating a double pole, responsible \nfor the corner frequency of the converter (see Section 9.2.2.4 ). Table 9-2  can be used to simplify the output \nfilter component selection. Checked cells represent combinations that are proven for stability by simulation \nand lab test. Further combinations should be checked for each individual application. See Optimizing the \nTPS62130/40/50/60 Output Filter Application Report  for details.\nTable 9-2.

FSW should be set low in this case. \nHowever, for applications running with the low-frequency setting (FSW = high) or with low input voltages, 3.3 µH \nis recommended.\nNote\nDC bias effect:  High-capacitance ceramic capacitors have a DC bias effect, which has a strong \ninfluence on the final effective capacitance. Therefore, the right capacitor value must be chosen \ncarefully. Package size and voltage rating in combination with dielectric material are responsible for \ndifferences between the rated capacitor value and the effective capacitance.\n9.2.2.2.1 Inductor Selection\nThe inductor selection is affected by several effects like inductor ripple current, output ripple voltage, PWM-to-\nPSM transition point, and efficiency.

The architecture of the TPS6214X allows the use \nof tiny ceramic output capacitors with low equivalent series resistance (ESR). These capacitors provide low \noutput-voltage ripple and are recommended. To keep its low resistance up to high frequencies and to get narrow \ncapacitance variation with temperature, it is recommended to use X7R or X5R dielectric. Using a higher value \ncan have some advantages, like smaller voltage ripple and a tighter DC output accuracy in power-save mode \n(see Optimizing the TPS62130/40/50/60 Output Filter Application Report ).\nNote: In power-save mode, the output voltage ripple depends on the output capacitance, its ESR and the peak \ninductor current. Using ceramic capacitors provides small ESR and low ripple.\n9.2.2.2.2.2 Input Capacitor\nFor most applications, 10 µF is sufficient and is recommended, though a larger value reduces input-current \nripple further. The input capacitor buffers the input voltage for transient events and also decouples the converter \nfrom the supply. A low-ESR multilayer ceramic capacitor is recommended for best filtering and should be placed \nbetween PVIN and PGND as close as possible to those pins. Even though AVIN and PVIN must be supplied \nfrom the same input source, it is recommended to place a capacitance of 0.1 uF from AVIN to AGND, to avoid \npotential noise coupling.\n9.2.2.2.2.3 Soft-Start Capacitor\nA capacitance connected between the SS/TR pin and AGND allows a user-programmable start-up slope of the \noutput voltage. A constant-current source provides 2.5 µA to charge the external capacitance.

The output voltage tracks that voltage.

Voltage Tracking Relationship\nOnce the SS/TR pin voltage reaches about 1.2V, the internal voltage is clamped to the internal feedback voltage \nand device goes to normal regulation. This works for rising and falling tracking voltages with the same behavior, \nas long as the input voltage is inside the recommended operating conditions. For decreasing SS/TR pin voltage, \nthe device doesn\'t sink current from the output. So, the resulting decrease of the output voltage may be slower \nthan the SS/TR pin voltage if the load is light. When driving the SS/TR pin with an external voltage, do not \nexceed the voltage rating of the SS/TR pin which is V IN+0.3V.\nIf the input voltage drops into undervoltage lockout or even down to zero, the output voltage goes to \nzero, independent of the tracking voltage.

A ratiometric \nstart-up sequence happens if both supplies are sharing the same soft-start capacitor. Equation 10  calculates \nthe soft-start time, though the SS/TR current must be doubled.

The FB pin can be easily set down to lower \nvalues than nominal by using the SS/TR pin. With that, the voltage drop on the sense resistor is low to avoid \nexcessive power loss. Because this pin provides 2.5 µA, the feedback pin voltage can be adjusted by an \nexternal resistor per Equation 15 . This drop, proportional to the LED current, is used to regulate the output \nvoltage (anode voltage) to a proper level to drive the LED. Both analog and PWM dimming are supported with \nthe TPS62140. Figure 9-40  shows an application circuit, tested with analog dimming:\nspacing\n22 \x1dF 10 \x1dF2.2 \x1dH\n(4 .. 17) V\n0.15 R 187 kADIMPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGNDTPS62140\nFigure 9-40.

The minimum input voltage must be rated according to the forward voltage needed by the LED \nused. More information is available in the application note Step-Down LED Driver With Dimming With the \nTPS621-Family and TPS821-Family Application Report .\n9.3.2 Active Output Discharge\nThe TPS62140A pulls the PG pin Low, when the device is shut down by EN, UVLO or thermal shutdown. \nConnecting PG to Vout through a resistor can be used to discharge Vout in those cases (see Figure 9-41 ). The \ndischarge rate can be adjusted by R3, which is also used to pull up the PG pin in normal operation. For reliability, \nkeep the maximum current into the PG pin less than 10mA.\nTPS62140A1 / 2.2 \x1dH\n(3 .. 13.7 )V\nR2R1Vout / 2 A\n22 uf10 uFPVIN\nAVIN\nEN\nSS/TR\nDEF\nFSWSW\nVOS\nPG\nFB\nAGND\nPGND\n    \nR3\n3.3 nF\nFigure 9-41.

Therefore, the PCB layout of the TPS6214x demands careful attention to ensure operation and to \nget the performance specified. A poor layout can lead to issues like poor regulation (both line and load), stability \nand accuracy weaknesses, increased EMI radiation, and noise sensitivity.\nSee Figure 11-1  for the recommended layout of the TPS6214x, which is designed for common external ground \nconnections. Therefore both AGND and PGND pins are directly connected to the Exposed Thermal Pad. On \nthe PCB, the direct common ground connection of AGND and PGND to the Exposed Thermal Pad and the \nsystem ground (ground plane) is mandatory. Also connect the VOS pin in the shortest way to VOUT at the output \ncapacitor. To avoid noise coupling into the VOS line, this connection should be separated from the VOUT power \nline/plane as shown in Section 11.2.\nProvide low inductive and resistive paths for loops with high di/dt. Therefore, paths conducting the switched load \ncurrent should be as short and wide as possible. Provide low capacitive paths (with respect to all other nodes) \nfor wires with high dv/dt. Therefore, the input and output capacitance should be placed as close as possible to \nthe IC pins and parallel wiring over long distances as well as narrow traces should be avoided. Loops which \nconduct an alternating current should outline an area as small as possible, as this area is proportional to the \nenergy radiated.\nSensitive nodes like FB and VOS need to be connected with short wires and not nearby high dv/dt signals (that \nis, SW). As they carry information about the output voltage, they should be connected as close as possible to the \nactual output voltage (at the output capacitor). The capacitor on the SS/TR pin and on AVIN as well as the FB \nresistors, R1 and R2, should be kept close to the IC and connect directly to those pins and the system ground \nplane.\nThe Exposed Thermal Pad must be soldered to the circuit board for mechanical reliability and to achieve \nappropriate power dissipation.\nThe recommended layout is implemented on the EVM and shown in its Users Guide, TPS6213x Buck Converter \nEvaluation Module User\'s Guide . Additionally, the Gebers for HPA505 EVM  are available for download.\n11.2 Layout Example\nspaceTPS62140, TPS62140A, TPS62141, TPS62142, TPS62143\nSLVSAJ0F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n28 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62140  TPS62140A  TPS62141  TPS62142  TPS62143\nVIN\nGNDAGND\nVOUTSW\nSWPG\nAVIN\nPVINPVIN\nPGNDENPGNDAGNDFB\nSW\nVOSSS/TRFSW DEFR1\nR2\nC1 C3C5\nL1\nFigure 11-1. Layout Recommendation\n11.3 Thermal Considerations\nImplementation of integrated circuits in low-profile and fine-pitch surface-mount packages typically requires \nspecial attention to power dissipation. Many system-dependent issues such as thermal coupling, airflow, added \nheat sinks and convection surfaces, and the presence of other heat-generating components affect the power-\ndissipation limits of a given component.\nThree basic approaches for enhancing thermal performance are listed below:\n•Improving the power dissipation capability of the PCB design\n•Improving the thermal coupling of the component to the PCB by soldering the exposed thermal pad\n•Introducing airflow in the system\nFor more details on how to use the thermal parameters, see the application notes: Thermal Characteristics \nApplication Note ( Thermal Characteristics of Linear and Logic Packages Using JEDEC PCB Designs Application \nReport ), and ( Semiconductor and IC Package Thermal Metrics Application Report ).\nThe TPS6214X is designed for a maximum operating junction temperature (T J) of 125°C. Therefore, the \nmaximum output power is limited by the power losses that can be dissipated over the actual thermal resistance, \ngiven by the package and the surrounding PCB structures. Since the thermal resistance of the package is fixed, \nincreasing the size of the surrounding copper area and improving the thermal connection to the IC can reduce \nthe thermal resistance. To get improved thermal behavior, it is recommended to use top layer metal to connect \nthe device with wide and thick metal lines. Internal ground layers can connect to vias directly under the IC for \nimproved thermal performance.\nIf short-circuit or overload conditions are present, the device is protected by limiting internal power dissipation. \nExperimental data, taken from the TPS62140 EVM, shows the maximum ambient temperature (without \nadditional cooling like airflow or heat sink), that can be allowed to limit the junction temperature to at most \n125°C (see Figure 9-38 ).www.ti.comTPS62140, TPS62140A, TPS62141, TPS62142, TPS62143\nSLVSAJ0F – NOVEMBER 2011 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TPS62140  TPS62140A  TPS62141  TPS62142  TPS62143\n12 Device and Documentation Support\n12.1 Device Support\n12.1.1 Third-Party Products Disclaimer\nTI\'S PUBLICATION OF INFORMATION REGARDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DOES NOT \nCONSTITUTE AN ENDORSEMENT REGARDING THE SUITABILITY OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES \nOR A WARRANTY, REPRESENTATION OR ENDORSEMENT OF SUCH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, EITHER \nALONE OR IN COMBINATION WITH ANY TI PRODUCT OR SERVICE.\n12.2 Documentation Support\n12.2.1 Related Documentation\nFor related documentation see the following:\n•Users Guide, SLVU437\n•EVM Gerber Data, SLVC394\n•Thermal Characteristics Application Note, SZZA017  and SPRA953\n12.3 Receiving Notification of Documentation Updates\nTo receive notification of documentation updates, navigate to the device product folder on ti.com .
