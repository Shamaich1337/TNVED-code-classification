F | 4 of 95The AD7124-8  is a low power, low noise, completely integrated\nanalog front end for high precision measurement applications. The\nAD7124-8  W grade is AEC-Q100 qualified for automotive applica-\ntions. The device contains a low noise, 24-bit Σ-Δ analog-to-digital\nconverter (ADC), and can be configured to have 8 differential\ninputs or 15 single-ended or pseudo differential inputs. The on-chip\nlow gain stage ensures that signals of small amplitude can be\ninterfaced directly to the ADC.\nOne of the major advantages of the AD7124-8  is that it gives the\nuser the flexibility to employ one of three integrated power modes.\nThe current consumption, range of output data rates, and rms noise\ncan be tailored with the power mode selected. The device also\noffers a multitude of filter options, ensuring that the user has the\nhighest degree of flexibility.\nThe AD7124-8  can achieve simultaneous 50 Hz and 60 Hz rejec-\ntion when operating at an output data rate of 25 SPS (single cycle\nsettling), with rejection in excess of 80 dB achieved at lower output\ndata rates.\nThe AD7124-8  establishes the highest degree of signal chain\nintegration. The device contains a precision, low noise, low drift in-\nternal band gap reference and accepts an external differential\nreference, which can be internally buffered. Other key integrated\nfeatures include programmable low drift excitation current sources,\nburnout currents, and a bias voltage generator, which sets the\ncommon-mode voltage of a channel to AVDD/2. The low-side power\nswitch enables the user to power down bridge sensors between\nconversions, ensuring the absolute minimal power consumption of\nthe system. The device also allows the user the option of operating\nwith either an internal clock or an external clock.\nThe integrated channel sequencer allows several channels to be\nenabled simultaneously, and the AD7124-8  sequentially converts on\neach enabled channel, simplifying communication with the device.As many as 16 channels can be enabled at any time, a channel\nbeing defined as an analog input or a diagnostic such as a power\nsupply check or a reference check. This unique feature allows\ndiagnostics to be interleaved with conversions. The AD7124-8\nalso supports per channel configuration. The device allows eight\nconfigurations or setups. Each configuration consists of gain, filter\ntype, output data rate, buffering, and reference source. The user\ncan assign any of these setups on a channel by channel basis.\nThe AD7124-8  also has extensive diagnostic functionality integrat-\ned as part of its comprehensive feature set. These diagnostics\ninclude a cyclic redundancy check (CRC), signal chain checks,\nand serial interface checks, which lead to a more robust solution.\nThese diagnostics reduce the need for external components to\nimplement diagnostics, resulting in reduced board space needs,\nreduced design cycle times, and cost savings. The failure modes\neffects and diagnostic analysis (FMEDA) of a typical application has\nshown a safe failure fraction (SFF) greater than 90% according to\nIEC 61508.\nThe device operates with a single analog power supply from 2.7\nV to 3.6 V or a dual 1.8 V power supply. The digital supply has a\nrange of 1.65 V to 3.6 V. It is specified for a temperature range of\n−40°C to +125°C. The AD7124-8  is housed in a 32-lead LFCSP\npackage .\nNote that, throughout this data sheet, multifunction pins, such as\nDOUT/ RDY, are referred to either by the entire pin name or by a\nsingle function of the pin, for example, RDY, when only that function\nis relevant.\nThe AD7124-8  B grade and W grade have some package or\nperformance differences from the AD7124-8 . Table 1  lists the differ-\nences. Unless otherwise noted, all references to AD7124-8  refer to\nthe device and not to the B or W grade.\nTable 1.

For the other power modes, this specification is supported by characterization data at the initial product release.\n5Following a system or internal zero-scale calibration, the offset error is in the order of the noise for the programmed gain and output data rate selected. A system full- scale\ncalibration reduces the gain error to the order of the noise for the programmed gain and output data rate.\n6Recalibration at any temperature removes these errors.\n7Gain error applies to both positive and negative full-scale. A factory calibration is performed at gain = 1, TA = 25°C.\n8When gain > 1, the common-mode voltage is between (AVSS + 0.1 + 0.5/gain) and (AVDD − 0.1 − 0.5/gain).\n9Specification is for a wider common-mode voltage between (AVSS − 0.05 + 0.5/gain) and (AVDD − 0.1 − 0.5/gain).\n10REJ60 is a bit in the filter registers. When the first notch of the sinc filter is at 50 Hz, a notch is placed at 60 Hz when REJ60 is set to 1. This gives simultaneous 50 Hz and\n60 Hz rejection.\n11When the gain is greater than 1, the analog input buffers are enabled automatically. The buffers can only be disabled when the gain equals 1.\n12When VREF = (AVDD − AVSS), the typical differential input equals 0.92 × VREF/gain for the low and mid power modes and 0.86 × VREF/gain for full power mode when gain >\n1.\n13The digital inputs are equal to IOVDD or DGND with excitation currents and bias voltage generator disabled.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nSPECIFICATIONS\nanalog.com Rev.

The measured\nnumber is then extrapolated back to remove the effects of charging or discharging the 25 pF capacitor. The times quoted in the timing characteristics are the true bus\nrelinquish times of the device and, therefore, are independent of external bus loading capacitances.\n7RDY returns high after a read of the ADC. In single conversion mode and continuous conversion mode, the same data can be read again, if required, while RDY is high,\nalthough subsequent reads must not occur close to the next output update. In continuous read mode, the digital word can be read only once.\n8When the CS_EN bit is cleared, the DOUT/ RDY pin changes from its DOUT function to its RDY function, following the last inactive edge of the SCLK. When CS_EN is set,\nthe DOUT pin continues to output the LSB of the data until the CS inactive edge.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nSPECIFICATIONS\nanalog.com Rev.

This pin is a logic input that allows synchronization of the digital filters and analog modulators when using\na number of AD7124-8  devices. When SYNC  is low, the nodes of the digital filter, the filter control logic, and the calibration control\nlogic are reset, and the analog modulator is held in a reset state. SYNC  does not affect the digital interface but does reset RDY to a\nhigh state if it is low.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nPIN CONFIGURATION AND FUNCTION DESCRIPTIONS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 17 of 95Table 7. Pin Function Descriptions  (Continued)\nPin No. Mnemonic Description\n28 DOUT/ RDY Serial Data Output/Data Ready Output. DOUT/ RDY functions as a serial data output pin to access the output shift register of the\nADC. The output shift register can contain data from any of the on-chip data or control registers. In addition, DOUT/ RDY operates as\na data ready pin, going low to indicate the completion of a conversion. If the data is not read after the conversion, the pin goes high\nbefore the next update occurs. The DOUT/ RDY falling edge can also be used as an interrupt to a processor, indicating that valid\ndata is available. With an external serial clock, the data can be read using the DOUT/ RDY pin. When CS is low, the data/control\nword information is placed on the DOUT/ RDY pin on the SCLK falling edge and is valid on the SCLK rising edge.\n29 DIN Serial Data Input to the Input Shift Register on the ADC. Data in the input shift register is transferred to the control registers within\nthe ADC, with the register selection bits of the communications register identifying the appropriate register.\n30 SCLK Serial Clock Input. This serial clock input is for data transfers to and from the ADC. The SCLK pin has a Schmitt-triggered input,\nmaking the interface suitable for opto-isolated applications. The serial clock can be continuous with all data transmitted in a\ncontinuous train of pulses. Alternatively, it can be a noncontinuous clock with the information being transmitted to or from the ADC in\nsmaller batches of data.\n31 CLK Clock Input/Clock Output. The internal clock can be made available at this pin. Alternatively, the internal clock can be disabled, and\nthe ADC can be driven by an external clock. This allows several ADCs to be driven from a common clock, allowing simultaneous\nconversions to be performed.\n32 CS Chip Select Input. This is an active low logic input that selects the ADC. Use CS to select the ADC in systems with more than one\ndevice on the serial bus or as a frame synchronization signal in communicating with the device. CS can be hardwired low if the\nserial peripheral interface (SPI) diagnostics are unused, allowing the ADC to operate in 3-wire mode with SCLK, DIN, and DOUT\ninterfacing with the device.\nEP Exposed Pad.

F | 18 of 95AINP\nAINP refers to the positive analog input.\nAINM\nAINM refers to the negative analog input.\nIntegral Nonlinearity (INL)\nINL is the maximum deviation of any code from a straight line pass-\ning through the endpoints of the transfer function. The endpoints of\nthe transfer function are zero scale (not to be confused with bipolar\nzero), a point 0.5 LSB below the first code transition (000 … 000\nto 000 … 001), and full scale, a point 0.5 LSB above the last code\ntransition (111 … 110 to 111 … 111). The error is expressed in ppm\nof the full-scale range.\nGain Error\nGain error is the deviation of the last code transition (111 … 110 to\n111 … 111) from the ideal AINP voltage (AINM + VREF/gain − 3/2\nLSBs). Gain error applies to both unipolar and bipolar analog input\nranges.\nGain error is a measure of the span error of the ADC. It includes\nfull-scale errors but not zero-scale errors. For unipolar input ranges,\nit is defined as full-scale error minus unipolar offset error; whereas\nfor bipolar input ranges it is defined as full-scale error minus bipolar\nzero error.Offset Error\nOffset error is the deviation of the first code transition from the ideal\nAINP voltage (AINM + 0.5 LSB) when operating in the unipolar\nmode.\nIn bipolar mode, offset error is the deviation of the midscale transi-\ntion (0111 … 111 to 1000 … 000) from the ideal AINP voltage\n(AINM − 0.5 LSB).\nOffset Calibration Range\nIn the system calibration modes, the AD7124-8  calibrates offset\nwith respect to the analog input. The offset calibration range specifi-\ncation defines the range of voltages that the AD7124-8  can accept\nand still calibrate offset accurately.\nFull-Scale Calibration Range\nThe full-scale calibration range is the range of voltages that the\nAD7124-8  can accept in the system calibration mode and still\ncalibrate full scale correctly.\nInput Span\nIn system calibration schemes, two voltages applied in sequence\nto the AD7124-8  analog input define the analog input range. The\ninput span specification defines the minimum and maximum input\nvoltages from zero to full scale that the AD7124-8  can accept and\nstill calibrate gain accurately.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nTYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nanalog.com Rev.

F | 28 of 95Table 8  through Table 37  show the rms noise, peak-to-peak noise,\neffective resolution, and noise-free (peak-to-peak) resolution of the\nAD7124-8  for various output data rates, gain settings, and filters.\nThe numbers given are for the bipolar input range with an external\n2.5 V reference. These numbers are typical and are generated with\na differential input voltage of 0 V when the ADC is continuously\nconverting on a single channel. It is important to note that the\neffective resolution is calculated using the rms noise, whereas thepeak-to-peak resolution (shown in parentheses) is calculated based\non peak-to-peak noise (shown in parentheses). The peak-to-peak\nresolution represents the resolution for which there is no code\nflicker.\nEffective Resolution = Log2(Input Range/RMS Noise)\nPeak-to-Peak Resolution = Log2(Input Range/Peak-to-Peak Noise)\nFULL POWER MODE\nSinc4\nTable 8.

Basic Connection Diagram\nOVERVIEW\nThe AD7124-8  is a low power ADC that incorporates a Σ-Δ mod-\nulator, buffer, reference, gain stage, and on-chip digital filtering,\nwhich is intended for the measurement of wide dynamic ranges, low\nfrequency signals (such as those in pressure transducers), weigh\nscales, and temperature measurement applications.\nPower Modes\nThe AD7124-8  offers three power modes: high power mode, mid\npower mode, and low power mode. This allows the user total\nflexibility in terms of speed, rms noise, and current consumption.\nAnalog Inputs\nThe device can have 8 differential or 15 pseudo differential analog\ninputs. The analog inputs can be buffered or unbuffered. The\nAD7124-8  uses flexible multiplexing; thus, any analog input pin can\nbe selected as a positive input (AINP) and any analog input pin can\nbe selected as a negative input (AINM).\nMultiplexer\nThe on-chip multiplexer increases the channel count of the device.\nBecause the multiplexer is included on chip, any channel changes\nare synchronized with the conversion process.\nReference\nThe device contains a 2.5 V reference, which has a drift of\n15 ppm/°C maximum for the AD7124-8  and AD7124-8  W grade\nand 10 ppm/°C maximum for the AD7124-8  B grade.\nReference buffers are also included on chip, which can be used\nwith the internal reference and externally applied references.Programmable Gain Array (PGA)\nThe analog input signal can be amplified using the PGA. The PGA\nallows gains of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128.\nBurnout Currents\nTwo burnout currents, which can be programmed to 500 nA, 2 µA,\nor 4 µA, are included on chip to detect the presence of the external\nsensor.\nΣ-Δ ADC and Filter\nThe AD7124-8  contains a fourth-order Σ-Δ modulator followed by a\ndigital filter. The device has the following filter options:\n►Sinc4\n►Sinc3\n►Fast filter\n►Post filter\n►Zero latency\nChannel Sequencer\nThe AD7124-8  allows up to 16 configurations, or channels. These\nchannels can consist of analog inputs, reference inputs, or power\nsupplies such that diagnostic functions, such as power supply\nmonitoring, can be interleaved with conversions. The sequencer\nautomatically converts all enabled channels. When each enabled\nchannel is selected, the time required to generate the conversion is\nequal to the settling time for the selected channel.\nPer Channel Configuration\nThe AD7124-8  allows up to eight different setups, each setup\nconsisting of a gain, output data rate, filter type, and a reference\nsource. Each channel is then linked to a setup.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nGETTING STARTED\nanalog.com Rev. F | 38 of 95Serial Interface\nThe AD7124-8  has a 3-wire or 4-wire SPI. The on-chip registers are\naccessed via the serial interface.\nClock\nThe device has an internal 614.4 kHz clock. Use either this clock\nor an external clock as the clock source for the device. The internal\nclock can also be made available on a pin if a clock source is\nrequired for external circuitry.\nTemperature Sensor\nThe on-chip temperature sensor monitors the die temperature.\nDigital Outputs\nThe AD7124-8  has four general-purpose digital outputs. These can\nbe used for driving external circuitry. For example, an external\nmultiplexer can be controlled by these outputs.\nCalibration\nBoth internal calibration and system calibration are included on\nchip; therefore, the user has the option of removing offset or gain\nerrors internal to the device only, or removing the offset or gain\nerrors of the complete end system.\nExcitation Currents\nThe device contains two excitation currents that can be set inde-\npendently to 0.1 µA, 50 µA, 100 µA, 250 µA, 500 µA, 750 µA, or 1\nmA.\nBias Voltage\nA bias voltage generator is included on chip so that signals from\nthermocouples can be biased suitably. The bias voltage is set to\n(AVDD − AVSS)/2 and can be made available on any input. It can\nsupply multiple channels.\nBridge Power Switch (PSW)\nA low-side power switch allows the user to power down bridges that\nare interfaced to the ADC.\nDiagnostics\nThe AD7124-8  includes numerous diagnostics features such as\n►Reference detection\n►Overvoltage/undervoltage detection\n►CRC on SPI communications\n►CRC on the memory map\n►SPI read/write checksThese diagnostics allow a high level of fault coverage in an applica-\ntion.\nPOWER SUPPLIES\nThe AD7124-8  operates with an analog power supply voltage from\n2.7 V to 3.6 V in low or mid power mode and from 2.9 V to 3.6 V\nin full power mode. The device accepts a digital power supply from\n1.65 V to 3.6 V.\nThe device has two independent power supply pins: AVDD and\nIOVDD.\n►AVDD is referred to AVSS. AVDD powers the internal analog\nregulator that supplies the ADC.\n►IOVDD is referred to DGND. This supply sets the interface logic\nlevels on the SPI interface and powers an internal regulator for\noperation of the digital processing.\nSingle Supply Operation (AV SS = DGND)\nWhen the AD7124-8  is powered from a single supply that is\nconnected to AVDD, AVSS and DGND can be shorted together\non one single ground plane. With this setup, an external level\nshifting circuit is required when using truly bipolar inputs to shift\nthe common-mode voltage. Recommended regulators include the\nADP162 , which has a low quiescent current.\nSplit Supply Operation (AV SS ≠ DGND)\nThe AD7124-8  can operate with AVSS set to a negative voltage,\nallowing true bipolar inputs to be applied. This allows a truly fully\ndifferential input signal centered around 0 V to be applied to the\nAD7124-8  without the need for an external level shifting circuit. For\nexample, with a 3.6 V split supply, AVDD = +1.8 V and AVSS = −1.8\nV. In this use case, the AD7124-8 -internally level shifts the signals,\nallowing the digital output to function between DGND (nominally 0\nV) and IOVDD.\nWhen using a split supply for AVDD and AVSS, the absolute max-\nimum ratings must be considered (see the Absolute Maximum\nRatings section). Ensure that IOVDD is set below 3.6 V to stay\nwithin the absolute maximum ratings for the device.\nDIGITAL COMMUNICATION\nThe AD7124-8  has a 3-wire or 4-wire SPI interface that is compati-\nble with QSPI, MICROWIRE, and DSPs. The interface operates in\nSPI Mode 3 and can be operated with CS tied low. In SPI Mode 3,\nSCLK idles high, the falling edge of SCLK is the drive edge, and the\nrising edge of SCLK is the sample edge. This means that data is\nclocked out on the falling/drive edge and data is clocked in on the\nrising/sample edge.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nGETTING STARTED\nanalog.com Rev. F | 39 of 95DRIVE EDGE SAMPLE EDGE\n069\nFigure 65. SPI Mode 3, SCLK Edges\nAccessing the ADC Register Map\nThe communications register controls access to the full register\nmap of the ADC. This register is an 8-bit, write only register. On\npower-up or after a reset, the digital interface defaults to a state\nwhere it expects a write to the communications register; therefore,\nall communication begins by writing to the communications register.\nThe data written to the communications register determines which\nregister is accessed and if the next operation is a read or write. The\nregister address bits (Bit 5 to Bit 0) determine the specific register\nto which the read or write operation applies.\nWhen the read or write operation to the selected register is com-\nplete, the interface returns to its default state, where it expects a\nwrite operation to the communications register.\nIn situations where interface synchronization is lost, a write opera-\ntion of at least 64 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns the ADC\nto its default state by resetting the entire device, including the regis-\nter contents. Alternatively, if CS is used with the digital interface,\nreturning CS high resets the digital interface to its default state and\naborts any current operation.\nFigure 66  and Figure 67  illustrate writing to and reading from a\nregister by first writing the 8-bit command to the communications\nregister followed by the data for the addressed register.\nReading the ID register is the recommended method for verifying\ncorrect communication with the device. The ID register is a readonly register and contains the value of 0x17.

F | 40 of 95CONFIGURATION OVERVIEW\nAfter power-on or reset, the AD7124-8  default configuration is as\nfollows:\n►Channel: Channel 0 is enabled, AIN0 is selected as the positive\ninput, and AIN1 is selected as the negative input. Setup 0 is\nselected.\n►Setup: the input and reference buffers are disabled, the gain is\nset to 1, and the external reference is selected.\n►ADC control: the AD7124-8  is in low power mode, continuous\nconversion mode and the internal oscillator is enabled and se-\nlected as the master clock source.\n►Diagnostics: the only diagnostic enabled is the SPI_IG-\nNORE_ERR function.\nNote that only a few of the register setting options are shown; this\nlist is just an example. For full register information, see the On-Chip\nRegisters  section.\nFigure 68  shows an overview of the suggested flow for changing\nthe ADC configuration, divided into the following four blocks:\n►Channel configuration (see Box A in Figure 68 )\n►Setup (see Box B in Figure 68 )\n►Diagnostics (see Box C in Figure 68 )\n►ADC control (see Box D in Figure 68 )Channel Configuration\nThe AD7124-8  has 16 independent analog input channels and eight\nindependent setups. The user can select any of the analog input\npairs on any channel, as well as any of the eight setups for any\nchannel, giving the user full flexibility in the channel configuration.\nThis also allows per channel configuration when using all differential\ninputs because each channel can have its own dedicated setup.\nAlong with the analog inputs, signals such as the power supply\nor reference can also be used as inputs; they are routed to the\nmultiplexer internally when selected. The AD7124-8  allows the user\nto define 16 configurations, or channels, to the ADC. This allows\ndiagnostics to be interleaved with conversions.\nChannel Registers\nUse the channel registers to select which input pins are either the\npositive analog input or the negative analog input for that channel.\nThis register also contains a channel enable/disable bit and the\nsetup selection bits, which are used to select which of the eight\navailable setups to use for this channel.\nWhen the AD7124-8  is operating with more than one channel ena-\nbled, the channel sequencer cycles through the enabled channels\nin sequential order, from Channel 0 to Channel 15. If a channel\nis disabled, it is skipped by the sequencer. Details of the channel\nregister for Channel 0 are shown in Table 40 .\nDIAGNOSTICS\nENABLE CRC, SPI READ AND WRITE CHECKS\nENABLE LDO CHECKS, AND MORESETUP\n8 POSSIBLE ADC SETUPS\nSELECT FILTER, OUTPUT DA TA RATE, GAIN AND MORECHANNEL CONFIGURATION\nSELECT POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INPUT FOR EACH ADC CHANNEL\nSELECT ONE OF 8 SETUPS FOR ADC CHANNELA\nB\nC\nADC CONTROL\nSELECT ADC OPERATING MODE, CLOCK SOURCE,\nSELECT POWER MODE, DA TA + ST ATUS, AND MORED\n072\nFigure 68.

F | 41 of 95ADC Setups\nThe AD7124-8  has eight independent setups. Each setup consists\nof the following four registers:\n►Configuration register\n►Filter register\n►Offset register\n►Gain register\nFor example, Setup 0 consists of Configuration Register 0, Filter\nRegister 0, Offset Register 0, and Gain Register 0. Figure 69  shows\nthe grouping of these registers. The setup is selectable from the\nchannel registers detailed in the Channel Configuration  section.\nThis allows each channel to be assigned to one of eight separate\nsetups. Table 41  through Table 44  show the four registers that are\nassociated with Setup 0. This structure is repeated for Setup 1 to\nSetup 7.\nConfiguration Registers\nThe configuration registers allow the user to select the output\ncoding of the ADC by selecting between bipolar and unipolar. Inbipolar mode, the ADC accepts negative differential input voltages,\nand the output coding is offset binary. In unipolar mode, the ADC\naccepts only positive differential voltages, and the coding is straight\nbinary. In either case, the input voltage must be within the AVDD\nand AVSS supply voltages. The user can also select the reference\nsource using these registers. Four options are available: an inter-\nnal 2.5 V reference, an external reference connected between RE-\nFIN1(+) and REFIN1( −), an external reference connected between\nREFIN2(+) and REFIN2( −), or AVDD to AVSS. The PGA gain is also\nset; gains of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 are provided. The\nanalog input buffers and reference input buffers for the setup can\nalso be enabled using this register.\nFilter Registers\nThe filter registers select which digital filter is used at the output\nof the ADC modulator. The filter type and the output data rate are\nselected by setting the bits in this register.

The power-on reset value of an offset register is 0x800000.\nThe offset registers are 24-bit read/write registers. The power-on\nreset value is automatically overwritten if an internal or system\nzero-scale calibration is initiated by the user or if the offset registers\nare written to by the user.\nGain Registers\nThe gain registers are 24-bit registers that hold the gain calibration\ncoefficient for the ADC. The gain registers are read/write registers.\nThe gain is factory calibrated at a gain of 1; thus, the default value\nvaries from device to device. The default value is automatically\noverwritten if an internal or system full-scale calibration is initiated\nby the user. For more information on calibration, see the Calibration\nsection.\nDiagnostics\nThe ERROR_EN register enables and disables the numerous diag-\nnostics on the AD7124-8 . By default, the SPI_IGNORE function\nis enabled, which indicates inappropriate times to write to the\nADC (for example, during power-up and during a reset). Other\ndiagnostics include\n►SPI read and write checks, which ensure that only valid registers\nare accessed\n►SCLK counter, which ensures that the correct number of SCLK\npulses are used\n►SPI CRC\n►Memory map CRC\n►LDO checks\nWhen a diagnostic is enabled, the corresponding flag is contained\nin the error register. All enabled flags are OR’ed to control the ERR\nflag in the status register. Thus, if an error occurs (for example, the\nSPI CRC check detects an error), the relevant flag (for example,\nthe SPI_CRC_ERR flag) in the error register is set. The ERR flag\nin the status register is also set. This is useful when the status bits\nare appended to conversions. The ERR bit indicates if an error has\noccurred. The user can then read the error register for more details\non the error source.\nThe frequency of the on-chip oscillator can also be monitored on\nthe AD7124-8 . The MCLK_COUNT register monitors the master\nclock pulses. Table 45  to Table 47  give more detail on the diagnos-\ntic registers. See the Diagnostics  section for more detail on the\ndiagnostics available.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nGETTING STARTED\nanalog.com Rev. F | 43 of 95ADC Control Register\nThe ADC control register configures the core peripherals for use\nby the AD7124-8  and the mode for the digital interface. The power\nmode (full power, mid power, or low power) is selected via this\nregister. Also, the mode of operation is selected, for example,\ncontinuous conversion or single conversion. The user can also\nselect the standby and power-down modes, as well as any of\nthe calibration modes. In addition, this register contains the clocksource select bits and the internal reference enable bits. The refer-\nence select bits are contained in the setup configuration registers\n(see the ADC Setups  section for more information).\nThe digital interface operation is also selected via the ADC control\nregister. This register allows the user to enable the data plus status\nread and continuous read mode. For more details, see the Digital\nInterface  section.

F | 44 of 95Understanding Configuration Flexibility\nIn Figure 70 , Figure 71 , and Figure 72 , the registers shown in black\nfont are programmed for this configuration. The registers shown in\ngray font are redundant.\nThe most straightforward implementation of the AD7124-8  is to use\ndifferential inputs with adjacent analog inputs and run all of them\nwith the same setup, gain correction, and offset correction register.\nFor example, the user requires four differential inputs. In this case,\nthe user selects the following differential inputs: AIN0/AIN1, AIN2/\nAIN3, AIN4/AIN5, and AIN6/AIN7.\nProgramming the gain and offset registers is optional for any use\ncase, as indicated by the dashed lines between the register blocks.If an internal or system offset or full-scale calibration is performed,\nthe gain and offset registers for the selected channel are automati-\ncally updated.\nAn alternative way to implement these four fully differential inputs\nis by taking advantage of the eight available setups. Motivation for\nthis includes having a different speed, noise, or gain requirement on\nsome of the four differential inputs vs. other inputs, or there may be\na specific offset or gain correction for particular channels. Figure 71\nshows how each of the differential inputs can use a separate setup,\nallowing full flexibility in the configuration of each channel.\nCONFIGURATION\nREGISTERSCHANNEL\nREGISTERS\nFILTER\nREGISTERSOFFSET\nREGISTERSGAIN\nREGISTERS\nSELECT PERIPHERAL\nFUNCTIONS FOR\nADC CHANNEL\nSELECT ANALOG INPUT PARTS\nENABLE THE CHANNEL\nSELECT SETUP 0SELECT DIGITAL\nFILTER TYPE\nAND OUTPUT DATA RATE\nANALOG INPUT BUFFERS\nREFERENCE BUFFERS\nBURNOUT\nREFERENCE SOURCE\nGAINSINC4\nSINC3\nSINC4 + SINC1\nSINC3 + SINC1\nENHANCED 50Hz/60Hz REJECTIONGAIN CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY\nPROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIREDOFFSET CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY PROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIRED0x19\n0x1A\n0x1B\n0x1C\n0x1D\n0x1E\n0x1F\n0x200x21\n0x22\n0x23\n0x24\n0x25\n0x26\n0x27\n0x280x31\n0x32\n0x33\n0x34\n0x35\n0x36\n0x37\n0x380x29\n0x2A\n0x2B\n0x2C\n0x2D\n0x2E\n0x2F\n0x30CONFIG_3\nCONFIG_5\nCONFIG_6\nCONFIG_7CONFIG_4CONFIG_0\nCONFIG_2CONFIG_1\nFILTER_3\nFILTER_5\nFILTER_6\nFILTER_7FILTER_4FILTER_0\nFILTER_2FILTER_1\nGAIN_3\nGAIN_5\nGAIN_6\nGAIN_7GAIN_4GAIN_0\nGAIN_2GAIN_1\nOFFSET_3\nOFFSET_5\nOFFSET_6\nOFFSET_7OFFSET_4OFFSET_0\nOFFSET_2OFFSET_10x09 CH0\n0x0A CH1\n0x0B CH2\n0x0C CH3\n0x0D CH4\n0x0E CH5\n0x0F CH6\n0x10 CH7\n0x11 CH8\n0x12 CH9\n0x13 CH10\n0x14 CH11\n0x15 CH12\n0x16 CH13\n0x17 CH14\n0x18 CH15AIN0\nAIN1\nAIN2\nAIN3\nAIN4\nAIN5\nAIN6\nAIN7\n074\nFigure 70.

Four Fully Differential Inputs with a Separate Setup per Channel\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nGETTING STARTED\nanalog.com Rev. F | 45 of 95Figure 72  shows an example of how the channel registers span\nbetween the analog input pins and the setup configurations down-\nstream. In this random example, two differential inputs and two\nsingle-ended inputs are required. The single-ended inputs are the\nAIN0/AIN7 and AIN6/AIN7 combinations. The first differential input\npair (AIN0/AIN1) uses Setup 0. The two single-ended input pairs\n(AIN0/AIN7 and AIN6/AIN7) are set up as diagnostics; therefore,\nthey use a separate setup (Setup 1). The final differential input\n(AIN2/AIN3) also uses a separate setup: Setup 2.\nGiven that three setups are selected for use, the CONFIG_0,\nCONFIG_1, and CONFIG_2 registers are programmed as required,\nand the FILTER_0, FILTER_1, and FILTER_2 registers are alsoprogrammed as required. Optional gain and offset correction can\nbe employed on a per setup basis by programming the GAIN_0,\nGAIN_1, and GAIN_2 registers and the OFFSET_0, OFFSET_1,\nand OFFSET_2 registers.\nIn the example shown in Figure 72 , the CHANNEL_0 to CHAN-\nNEL_3 registers are used. Setting the MSB (the enable bit) in\neach of these registers enables the four combinations via the\ncrosspoint multiplexer. When the AD7124-8  converts, the sequenc-\ner transitions in ascending sequential order from CHANNEL_0 to\nCHANNEL_1 to CHANNEL_2, and then on to CHANNEL_3 before\nlooping back to CHANNEL_0 to repeat the sequence.\nCONFIGURATION\nREGISTERSFILTER\nREGISTERSOFFSET\nREGISTERSGAIN\nREGISTERS\nSELECT PERIPHERAL\nFUNCTIONS FOR\nADC CHANNEL\nSELECT ANALOG INPUT PARTS\nENABLE THE CHANNEL\nSELECT SETUPSELECT DIGITAL\nFILTER TYPE\nAND OUTPUT DATA RATE\nANALOG INPUT BUFFERS\nREFERENCE BUFFERS\nBURNOUT\nREFERENCE SOURCE\nGAINSINC4\nSINC3\nSINC4 + SINC1\nSINC3 + SINC1\nENHANCED 50Hz/60Hz REJECTIONGAIN CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY\nPROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIREDOFFSET CORRECTION\nOPTIONALLY PROGRAMMED\nPER SETUP AS REQUIRED0x19\n0x1A\n0x1B\n0x1C\n0x1D\n0x1E\n0x1F\n0x200x21\n0x22\n0x23\n0x24\n0x25\n0x26\n0x27\n0x280x31\n0x32\n0x33\n0x34\n0x35\n0x36\n0x37\n0x380x29\n0x2A\n0x2B\n0x2C\n0x2D\n0x2E\n0x2F\n0x30CONFIG_3\nCONFIG_5\nCONFIG_6\nCONFIG_7CONFIG_4CONFIG_0\nCONFIG_ 2CONFIG_ 1\nFILTER_3\nFILTER_5\nFILTER_6\nFILTER_7FILTER_4FILTER_0\nFILTER_2FILTER_1\nGAIN_3\nGAIN_5\nGAIN_6\nGAIN_7GAIN_4GAIN_0\nGAIN_2GAIN_1\nOFFSET_3\nOFFSET_5\nOFFSET_6\nOFFSET_7OFFSET_4OFFSET_0\nOFFSET_2OFFSET_10x09 CHANNEL_0\n0x0A CHANNEL_1\n0x0B CHANNEL_2\n0x0C CHANNEL_3\n0x0D CHANNEL_4\n0x0E CHANNEL_5\n0x0F CHANNEL_6\n0x10 CHANNEL_7\nCHANNEL_8\nCHANNEL_9\nCHANNEL_10\nCHANNEL_11\nCHANNEL_12\nCHANNEL_13\nCHANNEL_14\nCHANNEL_15AIN0\nAIN1\nAIN2\nAIN3\nAIN4\nAIN5\nAIN6\nAIN7CHANNEL\nREGISTERS\n0x11\n0x12\n0x13\n0x14\n0x15\n0x16\n0x17\n0x18\n076\nFigure 72.

F | 46 of 95ANALOG INPUT CHANNEL\nThe AD7124-8  uses flexible multiplexing; thus, any of the analog\ninput pins, AIN0 to AIN15, can be selected as a positive input or\na negative input. This feature allows the user to perform diagnos-\ntics such as checking that pins are connected. It also simplifies\nprinted circuit board (PCB) design. For example, the same PCB can\naccommodate 2-wire, 3-wire, and 4-wire resistance temperature\ndetectors (RTDs).\nAIN0\nAIN1AVDD\nAVDD\nAVSSAVSS\nAVSSAVDD\nAVSS\nAIN14AVDD\nAIN15AVDD\nAVSSPGA TO ADCBURNOUT\nCURRENTS\n077\nFigure 73. Analog Input Multiplexer Circuit\nThe channels are configured using the AINP[4:0] bits and the\nAINM[4:0] bits in the channel registers (see Table 49 ). The device\ncan be configured to have 8 differential inputs, 15 pseudo differ-\nential inputs, or a combination of both. When using differentialinputs, use adjacent analog input pins to form the input pair. Using\nadjacent pins minimizes any mismatch between the channels.\nThe inputs can be buffered or unbuffered at a gain of 1 but are\nautomatically buffered when the gain exceeds 1. The AINP and\nAINM buffers are enabled/disabled separately using the AIN_BUFP\nand AIN_BUFM bits in the configuration register (see Table 50 ).\nIn buffered mode, the input channel feeds into a high impedance\ninput stage of the buffer amplifier. Therefore, the input can tolerate\nsignificant source impedances and is tailored for direct connection\nto external resistive type sensors such as strain gages or RTDs.\nWhen the device is operated in unbuffered mode, the device has\na higher analog input current. Note that this unbuffered input\npath provides a dynamic load to the driving source. Therefore,\nresistor/capacitor (RC) combinations on the input pins can cause\ngain errors, depending on the output impedance of the source that\nis driving the ADC input.\nThe absolute input voltage in unbuffered mode (gain = 1) includes\nthe range between AVSS − 50 mV and AVDD + 50 mV. The absolute\ninput voltage range in buffered mode at a gain of 1 is restricted\nto a range between AVSS + 100 mV and AVDD − 100 mV. The\ncommon-mode voltage must not exceed these limits; otherwise,\nlinearity and noise performance degrade.\nWhen the gain is greater than 1, the analog input buffers are\nautomatically enabled. The PGA placed in front of the input buffers\nis rail-to-rail; thus, in this case, the absolute input voltage includes\nthe range from AVSS − 50 mV to AVDD + 50 mV.\nTable 49. Channel Register\nReg.

PGA\nThe AD7124-8  can be programmed to have a gain of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16,\n32, 64, or 128 by using the PGA bits in the configuration register\n(see Table 50 ). The PGA consists of two stages. For a gain of 1,\nboth stages are bypassed. For gains of 2 to 8, a single stage is\nused, whereas for gains greater than 8, both stages are used.\nThe analog input range is ±VREF/gain. Therefore, with an external\n2.5 V reference, the unipolar ranges are from 0 mV to 19.53 mV to\n0 V to 2.5 V, and the bipolar ranges are from ±19.53 mV to ±2.5\nV. For high reference values, for example, VREF = AVDD, the analog\ninput range must be limited. Consult the Specifications  section for\nmore details on these limits.\nREFERENCE\nThe AD7124-8  has an embedded 2.5 V reference. The embedded\nreference is a low noise, low drift reference with 15 ppm/°C drift\nmaximum on the AD7124-8  and AD7124-8  W grade and 10 ppm/°C\ndrift maximum on the AD7124-8  B grade. Including the reference on\nthe AD7124-8  reduces the number of external components needed\nin applications such as thermocouples, leading to a reduced PCB\nsize.\nBAND GAP\nREF\n24-BIT\nΣ-Δ ADCREFIN1(+)\nREFOUTREFIN1(–)\nREFIN2(+)\nREFIN2(–)AVDD\nAVSSAVSS\nREFERENCE\nBUFFERS\n081\nFigure 75. Reference Connections\nThis reference can be used to supply the ADC (by setting the\nREF_EN bit in the ADC_CONTROL register to 1) or an external\nreference can be applied. For external references, the ADC has\na fully differential input capability for the channel. In addition, the\nuser can select one of two external reference options (REFIN1or REFIN2). The reference source for the AD7124-8  is selected\nusing the REF_SEL bits in the configuration register (see Table 50 ).\nWhen the internal reference is selected, it is internally connected to\nthe modulator. It can also be made available on the REFOUT pin.\nA 0.1 µF decoupling capacitor is required on REFOUT when the\ninternal reference is active.\nThe common-mode range for the differential reference inputs is\nfrom AVSS − 50 mV to AVDD + 50 mV when the reference buffers\nare disabled. The reference inputs can also be buffered on-chip.\nThe buffers require 100 mV of headroom. The reference voltage\nof REFIN (REFINx(+) − REFINx( −)) is 2.5 V nominal, but the\nAD7124-8  is functional with reference voltages from 0.5 V to AVDD.\nIn applications where the excitation (voltage or current) for the\ntransducer on the analog input also drives the reference voltage for\nthe devices, the effect of the low frequency noise in the excitation\nsource is removed, because the application is ratiometric. If the\nAD7124-8  is used in nonratiometric applications, use a low noise\nreference.\nThe recommended 2.5 V reference voltage sources for the\nAD7124-8  include the ADR4525 , which is a low noise, low power\nreference. Note that the reference input provides a high impedance,\ndynamic load when unbuffered. Because the input impedance of\neach reference input is dynamic, resistor/capacitor combinations\non these inputs can cause dc gain errors if the reference inputs\nare unbuffered, depending on the output impedance of the source\ndriving the reference inputs.\nReference voltage sources typically have low output impedances\nand are, therefore, tolerant to having decoupling capacitors on\nREFINx(+) without introducing gain errors in the system. Deriving\nthe reference input voltage across an external resistor means that\nthe reference input sees a significant external source impedance. In\nthis situation, using the reference buffers is required.\nREFINx(+)\n1µF 4.7µFADR4525\n2.5V REF\nREFINx(–)0.1µF 4.7µF3V\n082\nFigure 76. ADR4525 to AD7124-8  Connections\nBIPOLAR/UNIPOLAR CONFIGURATION\nThe analog input to the AD7124-8  can accept either unipolar or\nbipolar input voltage ranges, which allows the user to tune the ADC\ninput range to the sensor output range. When a split power supply\nis used, the device accepts truly bipolar inputs. When a single\npower supply is used, a bipolar input range does not imply that the\ndevice can tolerate negative voltages with respect to system AVSS.\nUnipolar and bipolar signals on the AINP input are referenced to\nthe voltage on the AINM input. For example, if AINM is 1.5 V and\nthe ADC is configured for unipolar mode with a gain of 1, the input\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 48 of 95voltage range on the AINP input is 1.5 V to 3 V when VREF =\nAVDD = 3 V. If the ADC is configured for bipolar mode, the analog\ninput range on the AINP input is 0 V to AVDD. The bipolar/unipolar\noption is chosen by programming the bipolar bit in the configuration\nregister.\nDATA OUTPUT CODING\nWhen the ADC is configured for unipolar operation, the output\ncode is natural (straight) binary with a zero differential input voltage\nresulting in a code of 00 … 00, a midscale voltage resulting in a\ncode of 100 … 000, and a full-scale input voltage resulting in a\ncode of 111 … 111. The output code for any analog input voltage\ncan be represented as\nCode = (2N × AIN × Gain)/VREF\nWhen the ADC is configured for bipolar operation, the output code\nis offset binary with a negative full-scale voltage resulting in a code\nof 000 … 000, a zero differential input voltage resulting in a code\nof 100 … 000, and a positive full-scale input voltage resulting in a\ncode of 111 … 111. The output code for any analog input voltage\ncan be represented as\nCode = 2N − 1 × [(AIN × Gain/VREF) + 1]\nwhere:\nN = 24.\nAIN is the analog input voltage.\nGain is the gain setting (1 to 128).\nEXCITATION CURRENTS\nThe AD7124-8  also contains two matched, software configurable,\nconstant current sources that can be programmed to equal 0.1 µA,\n50 µA, 100 µA, 250 µA, 500 µA, 750 µA, or 1 mA. These current\nsources can be used to excite external resistive bridges or RTD\nsensors. Both current sources source currents from AVDD and can\nbe directed to any of the analog input pins (see Figure 77 ).\nThe pins on which the currents are made available are programmed\nusing the IOUT1_CH and IOUT0_CH bits in the IO_CONTROL_1\nregister (see Table 51 ). The magnitude of each current source is\nindividually programmable using the IOUT1 and IOUT0 bits in theIO_CONTROL_1 register. In addition, both currents can be output\nto the same analog input pin.\nNote that the on-chip reference does not need to be enabled when\nusing the excitation currents.\nAIN0\nAIN1AVDDVBIASIOUT1 IOUT0\nAVDD\nAVSSAVSS\nAVDD\nAVSS\nAIN15AVDD\nAVSSVBIAS\nVBIASPGA TO ADCBURNOUT\nCURRENTS\n083\nFigure 77. Excitation Current and Bias Voltage Connections\nBRIDGE POWER-DOWN SWITCH\nIn bridge applications such as strain gages and load cells, the\nbridge itself consumes the majority of the current in the system. For\nexample, a 350 Ω load cell requires 8.6 mA of current when excited\nwith a 3 V supply. To minimize the current consumption of the\nsystem, the bridge can be disconnected (when it is not being used)\nusing the bridge power-down switch. The switch can withstand 30\nmA of continuous current, and it has an on resistance of 10 Ω\nmaximum. The PDSW bit in the IO_CONTROL_1 register controls\nthe switch.\nLOGIC OUTPUTS\nThe AD7124-8  has four general-purpose digital outputs: P1 to P4.\nThese are enabled using the GPIO_CTRL bits in the IO_CON-\nTROL_1 register (see Table 51 ). The pins can be pulled high or low\nusing the GPIO_DATx bits in the register; that is, the value at the\npin is determined by the setting of the GPIO_DATx bits. The logic\nlevels for these pins are determined by AVDD rather than by IOVDD.\nTable 51. Input/Output Control 1 Register\nReg.

F | 49 of 95These pins can be used to drive external circuitry, for example, an\nexternal multiplexer. If an external multiplexer is used to increase\nthe channel count, the multiplexer logic pins can be controlled via\nthe AD7124-8  general-purpose output pins. The general-purpose\noutput pins can be used to select the active multiplexer pin.\nBecause the operation of the multiplexer is independent of the\nAD7124-8 , reset the modulator and filter using the SYNC  pin or\nby writing to the mode or configuration register each time that the\nmultiplexer channel is changed.\nBIAS VOLTAGE GENERATOR\nA bias voltage generator is included on the AD7124-8  (see Figure\n77). It biases the selected input pin to (AVDD − AVSS)/2. This\nfunction is useful in thermocouple applications, as the voltage\ngenerated by the thermocouple must be biased around some dc\nvoltage if the ADC operates from a single power supply. The\nbias voltage generator is controlled using the VBIASx bits in the\nIO_CONTROL_2 register (see Table 53 ). The power-up time of\nthe bias voltage generator is dependent on the load capacitance.\nConsult the Specifications  section for more details.\nCLOCK\nThe AD7124-8  includes an internal 614.4 kHz clock on chip. This\ninternal clock has a tolerance of ±5%. Use either the internal clock\nor an external clock as the clock source to the AD7124-8 . The clock\nsource is selected using the CLK_SEL bits in the ADC_CONTROL\nregister (see Table 54 ).\nThe internal clock can also be made available at the CLK pin. This\nis useful when several ADCs are used in an application and the\ndevices must be synchronized. The internal clock from one device\ncan be used as the clock source for all ADCs in the system. Using\na common clock, the devices can be synchronized by applying a\ncommon reset to all devices, or the SYNC  pin can be pulsed.\nPOWER MODES\nThe AD7124-8  has three power modes: full power mode, mid\npower mode, and low power mode. The mode is selected using the\nPOWER_MODE bits in the ADC_CONTROL register. The power\nmode affects the power consumption of the device as well as\nchanging the master clock frequency. A 614.4 kHz clock is usedby the device. However, this clock is internally divided, the division\nfactor being dependent on the power mode. Thus, the range of\noutput data rates and performance is affected by the power mode.\nTable 52.

The LDOs\nremain active so that registers maintain their contents. If enabled,\nthe reference, internal oscillator, digital outputs P1 to P4, the bias\nvoltage generator and the low-side power switch remain active.\nThe excitation currents, if enabled, also remain active in standby\nmode. These blocks can be disabled, if required, by setting the\ncorresponding bits appropriately. The reference detection and LDO\ncapacitor detection functions are disabled in standby mode.\nOther diagnostics remain active if enabled when the ADC is in\nstandby mode. Diagnostics can be enabled or disabled while in\nstandby mode. However, any diagnostics that require the master\nclock (reference detect, undervoltage/overvoltage detection, LDO\ntrip tests, memory map CRC, and MCLK counter) must be enabled\nwhen the ADC is in continuous conversion mode or idle mode;\nthese diagnostics do not function if enabled in standby mode.\nThe standby current is typically 15 µA when the LDOs only are\nenabled. If functions such as the bias voltage generator remain\nactive in standby mode, the current increases by 36 µA typically. If\nthe internal oscillator remains active in standby mode, the current\nincreases by 22 µA typically. When exiting standby mode, the\nAD7124-8  requires 130 MCLK cycles to power up and settle.\nThe internal oscillator, if disabled in standby mode, requires an\nadditional 40 µs to power up and settle. If an external master clock\nis being used, ensure that it is active before issuing the command\nto exit standby mode. Do not write to the ADC_ CONTROL register\nagain until the ADC has powered up and settled.\nTable 53. Input/Output Control 2 Register\nReg.

F | 50 of 95In power-down mode, all blocks are powered down, including the\nLDOs. All registers lose their contents, and the digital outputs P1 to\nP4 are placed in tristate. To prevent accidental entry to power-down\nmode, the ADC must first be placed into standby mode. If an\nexternal master clock is being used, keep it active until the device\nis placed in power-down mode. Exiting power-down mode requires\n64 SCLK cycles with CS = 0 and DIN = 1, that is, a serial interface\nreset. The AD7124-8  requires 2 ms typically to power up and settle.\nAfter this time, the user can access the on-chip registers. The\npower-down current is 2 µA typically.\nDIGITAL INTERFACE\nThe programmable functions of the AD7124-8  are controlled using\na set of on-chip registers. Data is written to these registers via\nthe serial interface. Read access to the on-chip registers is also\nprovided by this interface. All communications with the device must\nstart with a write to the communications register. After power-on or\nreset, the device expects a write to its communications register. The\ndata written to this register determines whether the next operation\nis a read operation or a write operation, and determines to which\nregister this read or write operation occurs. Therefore, write access\nto any of the other registers on the devices begins with a write\noperation to the communications register, followed by a write to the\nselected register. A read operation from any other register (except\nwhen continuous read mode is selected) starts with a write to the\ncommunications register, followed by a read operation from the\nselected register.\nThe serial interface of the AD7124-8  consists of four signals: CS,\nDIN, SCLK, and DOUT/ RDY. The DIN line transfers data into the\non-chip registers, whereas DOUT/ RDY accesses data from the\non-chip registers. SCLK is the serial clock input for the device, and\nall data transfers (either on DIN or DOUT/ RDY) occur with respect\nto the SCLK signal. The DOUT/ RDY pin also operates as a data\nready signal; the line goes low when a new data-word is available in\nthe output register. It is reset high when a read operation from the\ndata register is complete. It also goes high before the data register\nupdates to indicate when not to read from the device, to ensure that\na data read is not attempted while the register is being updated. CS\nis used to select a device. It can decode the AD7124-8  in systems\nwhere several components are connected to the serial bus.\nFigure 3  and Figure 4  show timing diagrams for interfacing to\nthe AD7124-8  with CS decoding the devices. Figure 3  shows the\ntiming for a read operation from the output shift register of the\nAD7124-8 . Figure 4  shows the timing for a write operation to the\ninput shift register. A delay is required between consecutive SPI\ncommunications. Figure 5  shows the delay required between SPI\nread/write operations. It is possible to read the same word from\nthe data register several times, even though the DOUT/ RDY line\nreturns high after the first read operation. However, care must be\ntaken to ensure that the read operations are complete before the\nnext output update occurs. In continuous read mode, the data\nregister can be read only once.The serial interface can operate in 3-wire mode by tying CS low.\nIn this case, the SCLK, DIN, and DOUT/ RDY lines communicate\nwith the AD7124-8 . The end of the conversion can be monitored\nusing the RDY bit in the status register. This scheme is suitable\nfor interfacing to microcontrollers. If CS is required as a decoding\nsignal, it can be generated from a port pin. For microcontroller\ninterfaces, it is recommended that SCLK idle high between data\ntransfers.\nThe AD7124-8  can be operated with CS being used as a frame\nsynchronization signal. This scheme is useful for DSP interfaces.\nIn this case, the first bit (MSB) is effectively clocked out by CS,\nbecause CS normally occurs after the falling edge of SCLK in\nDSPs. SCLK can continue to run between data transfers, provided\nthe timing numbers are obeyed.\nCS must be used to frame read and write operations and\nthe CS_EN bit in the ADC_CONTROL register must be set\nwhen the diagnostics SPI_READ_ERR, SPI_WRITE_ERR, or\nSPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR are enabled.\nThe serial interface can be reset by writing a series of 1s on the\nDIN input. See the Reset  section for more details. Reset returns\nthe interface to the state in which it is expecting a write to the\ncommunications register\nThe AD7124-8  can be configured to continuously convert or per-\nform a single conversion (see Figure 78  through Figure 80 ).\nSingle Conversion Mode\nIn single conversion mode, the AD7124-8  performs a single con-\nversion and is placed in standby mode after the conversion is\ncomplete. If a master clock is present (external master clock or the\ninternal oscillator is enabled), DOUT/ RDY goes low to indicate the\ncompletion of a conversion. When the data-word is read from the\ndata register, DOUT/ RDY goes high. The data register can be read\nseveral times, if required, even when DOUT/ RDY is high. Do not\nread the ADC_CONTROL register close to the completion of a\nconversion because the mode bits are being updated by the ADC to\nindicate that the ADC is in standby mode.\nIf several channels are enabled, the ADC automatically sequences\nthrough the enabled channels and performs a conversion on each\nchannel. When a conversion is started, DOUT/ RDY goes high and\nremains high until a valid conversion is available and CS is low.\nAs soon as the conversion is available, DOUT/ RDY goes low. The\nADC then selects the next channel and begins a conversion. The\nuser can read the present conversion while the next conversion is\nbeing performed. As soon as the next conversion is complete, the\ndata register is updated; therefore, the user has a limited period\nin which to read the conversion. When the ADC has performed a\nsingle conversion on each of the selected channels, it returns to\nstandby mode.\nIf the DATA_STATUS bit in the ADC_CONTROL register is set\nto 1, the contents of the status register are output along with\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 51 of 95the conversion each time that the data read is performed. The\nfour LSBs of the status register indicate the channel to which the\nconversion corresponds.\nContinuous Conversion Mode\nContinuous conversion is the default power-up mode. The\nAD7124-8  converts continuously, and the RDY bit in the status\nregister goes low each time a conversion is complete. If CS is low,\nthe DOUT/ RDY line also goes low when a conversion is complete.\nTo read a conversion, write to the communications register, indicat-\ning that the next operation is a read of the data register. When\nthe data-word is read from the data register, DOUT/ RDY goes\nhigh. The user can read this register additional times, if required.\nHowever, the user must ensure that the data register is not being\naccessed at the completion of the next conversion; otherwise the\nnew conversion word is lost.When several channels are enabled, the ADC automatically se-\nquences through the enabled channels, performing one conversion\non each channel. When all channels are converted, the sequence\nstarts again with the first channel. The channels are converted in\norder from lowest enabled channel to highest enabled channel. The\ndata register is updated as soon as each conversion is available.\nThe DOUT/ RDY pin pulses low each time a conversion is available.\nThe user can then read the conversion while the ADC converts the\nnext enabled channel.\nIf the DATA_STATUS bit in the ADC_CONTROL register is set to 1,\nthe contents of the status register, along with the conversion data,\nare output each time the data register is read. The status register\nindicates the channel to which the conversion corresponds.\nDIN\nSCLKDOUT/RDYCS\n0x01 0x0004 0x42\nDA TA\n087\nFigure 78.

Continuous Read Configuration\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 52 of 95Continuous Read Mode\nIn continuous read mode, it is not required to write to the commu-\nnications register before reading ADC data; apply the required\nnumber of SCLKs after DOUT/ RDY goes low to indicate the end\nof a conversion. When the conversion is read, DOUT/ RDY returns\nhigh until the next conversion is available. In this mode, the data\ncan be read only once. Ensure that the data-word is read before the\nnext conversion is complete. If the user has not read the conversion\nbefore the completion of the next conversion, or if insufficient serial\nclocks are applied to the AD7124-8  to read the word, the serial\noutput register is reset when the next conversion is complete, and\nthe new conversion is placed in the output serial register. The\nADC must be configured for continuous conversion mode to use\ncontinuous read mode.\nTo enable continuous read mode, set the CONT_READ bit in the\nADC_CONTROL register. When this bit is set, the only serial inter-\nface operations possible are reads from the data register. To exit\ncontinuous read mode, write a read data command (0x42) while the\nDOUT/ RDY pin is low. Alternatively, apply a software reset, that is,\n64 SCLKs with CS = 0 and DIN = 1. This resets the ADC and all\nregister contents. These are the only commands that the interface\nrecognizes after it is placed in continuous read mode. DIN must be\nheld low in continuous read mode until an instruction is to be written\nto the device.\nIf multiple ADC channels are enabled, each channel is output in\nturn, with the status bits being appended to the data if DATA_\nSTATUS is set in the ADC_CONTROL register. The status register\nindicates the channel to which the conversion corresponds.\nDATA_STATUS\nThe contents of the status register can be appended to each con-\nversion on the AD7124-8 . This is a useful function if several chan-\nnels are enabled. Each time a conversion is output, the contents\nof the status register are appended. The four LSBs of the status\nregister indicate to which channel the conversion corresponds. In\naddition, the user can determine if any errors are being flagged via\nthe ERROR_FLAG bit. To append the status register contents to\nevery conversion, the DATA_STATUS bit in the ADC_CONTROL\nregister is set to 1.\nSERIAL INTERFACE RESET (DOUT_ RDY_DEL\nAND CS_EN BITS)\nThe instant at which the DOUT/ RDY pin changes from being a\nDOUT pin to a RDY pin is programmable on the AD7124-8 . By\ndefault, the DOUT/ RDY pin changes functionality after a period of\ntime following the last SCLK rising edge, the SCLK edge on which\nthe LSB is read by the processor. This time is 10 ns minimum\nby default and, by setting the DOUT_ RDY_DEL bit in the ADC_\nCONTROL register to 1, can be extended to 110 ns minimum.\nBy setting the CS_EN bit in the ADC_CONTROL register to 1, the\nDOUT/ RDY pin continues to output the LSB of the register beingread until CS is taken high. This configuration is useful if the CS\nsignal is used to frame all read operations. If CS is not used to\nframe all read operations, set CS_EN to 0 so that DOUT/ RDY\nchanges functionality following the last SCLK edge in the read\noperation.\nCS_EN must be set to 1 and the CS signal must be used to\nframe all read and write operations when the SPI_READ_ERR,\nSPI_WRITE_ERR, and SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR diagnostic functions\nare enabled.\nThe serial interface is always reset on the CS rising edge, that is,\nthe interface is reset to a known state whereby it awaits a write to\nthe communications register. Therefore, if a read or write operation\nis performed by performing multiple 8-bit data transfers, CS must\nbe held low until the all bits are transferred.\nRESET\nThe circuitry and serial interface of the AD7124-8  can be reset by\nwriting 64 consecutive 1s to the device. This resets the logic, the\ndigital filter, and the analog modulator, and all on-chip registers are\nreset to their default values. A reset is automatically performed on\npower-up. A reset requires a time of 90 MCLK cycles. A reset is\nuseful if the serial interface becomes asynchronous due to noise on\nthe SCLK line.\nCALIBRATION\nThe AD7124-8  provides four calibration modes that can be used to\neliminate the offset and gain errors on a per setup basis:\n►Internal zero-scale calibration mode\n►Internal full-scale calibration mode\n►System zero-scale calibration mode\n►System full-scale calibration mode\nOnly one channel can be active during calibration. After each\nconversion, the ADC conversion result is scaled using the ADC\ncalibration registers before being written to the data register.\nThe default value of the offset register is 0x800000, and the nomi-\nnal value of the gain register is 0x5XXXXX. The calibration range of\nthe ADC gain is from 0.4 × VREF/gain to 1.05 × VREF/gain.\nThe following equations show the calculations that are used in each\ncalibration mode. In unipolar mode, the ideal relationship—that is,\nnot taking into account the ADC gain error and offset error—is as\nfollows:\nD at a =\n0.75 × V I N\nV REF× 223− O f fs et − 0x800000 ×\nG ai n\n0x400000× 2(1)\nIn bipolar mode, the ideal relationship—that is, not taking into\naccount the ADC gain error and offset error—is as follows:\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev.

The DOUT/ RDY pin and the RDY bit in\nthe status register go high when the calibration initiates. When the\ncalibration is complete, the contents of the corresponding offset or\ngain register are updated, the RDY bit in the status register is reset,\nthe DOUT/ RDY pin returns low (if CS is low), and the AD7124-8\nreverts to idle mode.\nDuring an internal offset calibration, the selected positive analog\ninput pin is disconnected, and it is connected internally to the\nselected negative analog input pin. For this reason, it is necessary\nto ensure that the voltage on the selected negative analog input pin\ndoes not exceed the allowed limits and is free from excessive noise\nand interference.\nTo perform an internal full-scale calibration, a full-scale input volt-\nage is automatically connected to the selected analog input for\nthis calibration. A full-scale calibration is recommended each time\nthe gain of a channel is changed to minimize the full-scale error.\nWhen performing internal calibrations, the internal full-scale calibra-\ntion must be performed before the internal zero-scale calibration.\nTherefore, write the value 0x800000 to the offset register before\nperforming the internal full-scale calibration, which ensures that\nthe offset register is at its default value. The AD7124-8  is factory\ncalibrated at a gain of 1, and the resulting gain coefficient is the\ndefault gain coefficient on the device. The device does not support\nfurther internal full-scale calibrations at a gain of 1.\nSystem calibrations expect the system zero-scale (offset) and sys-\ntem full-scale (gain) voltages to be applied to the ADC pins before\ninitiating the calibration modes. As a result, errors external to the\nADC are removed. The system zero-scale calibration must be\nperformed before the system full-scale calibration.\nFrom an operational point of view, treat a calibration like another\nADC conversion. Set the system software to monitor the RDY bit in\nthe status register or the DOUT/ RDY pin to determine the end of a\ncalibration via a polling sequence or an interrupt-driven routine.\nAn internal/system offset calibration and system full-scale calibra-\ntion requires a time equal to the settling time of the selected filter\nto be completed. The internal full-scale calibration requires a time\nequal to four settling periods (gain > 1).\nA calibration can be performed at any output data rate. Using\nlower output data rates results in better calibration accuracy and is\naccurate for all output data rates. A new calibration is required for a\ngiven channel if the reference source or the gain for that channel is\nchanged.\nOffset and system full-scale calibrations can be performed in any\npower mode. Internal full-scale calibrations can be performed in the\nlow power or mid power modes only. Thus, when using full powermode, the user must select mid or low power mode to perform\nthe internal full-scale calibration. However, an internal full-scale\ncalibration performed in low or mid power mode is valid in full power\nmode, if the same gain is used.\nThe offset error is typically ±15 µV for gains of 1 to 8 and ±200/\ngain µV for higher output data rates. An internal or system offset\ncalibration reduces the offset error to the order of the noise. The\ngain error is factory calibrated at ambient temperature and at a\ngain of 1. Following this calibration, the gain error is ±0.0025%\nmaximum. Therefore, internal full-scale calibrations at a gain of 1\nare not supported on the AD7124-8 . For other gains, the gain error\nis −0.3%. An internal full-scale calibration at ambient temperature\nreduces the gain error to ±0.016% maximum for gains of 2 to 8 and\n±0.025% typically for higher gains. A system full-scale calibration\nreduces the gain error to the order of the noise.\nThe AD7124-8  provides the user with access to the on-chip calibra-\ntion registers, allowing the microprocessor to read the calibration\ncoefficients of the device and to write its own calibration coefficients\nfrom prestored values in the EEPROM. A read or write of the offset\nand gain registers can be performed at any time except during an\ninternal or self-calibration. The values in the calibration registers\nare 24 bits wide. The span and offset of the device can also be\nmanipulated using the registers.\nSPAN AND OFFSET LIMITS\nWhenever a system calibration mode is used, the amount of offset\nand span that can be accommodated is limited. The overriding\nrequirement in determining the amount of offset and gain that can\nbe accommodated by the device is the requirement that the positive\nfull-scale calibration limit is ≤1.05 × VREF/gain. This allows the input\nrange to go 5% above the nominal range. The built-in headroom\nin the AD7124-8  analog modulator ensures that the device still\noperates correctly with a positive full-scale voltage, which is 5%\nbeyond the nominal.\nThe range of input span in both the unipolar and bipolar modes has\na minimum value of 0.8 × VREF/gain and a maximum value of 2.1 ×\nVREF/gain. However, the span, which is the difference between the\nbottom of the AD7124-8  input range and the top of its input range,\nmust account for the limitation on the positive full-scale voltage. The\namount of offset that can be accommodated depends on whether\nthe unipolar or bipolar mode is being used. The offset must account\nfor the limitation on the positive full-scale voltage. In unipolar mode,\nthere is considerable flexibility in handling negative (with respect\nto AINM) offsets. In both unipolar and bipolar modes, the range\nof positive offsets that can be handled by the device depends on\nthe selected span. Therefore, in determining the limits for system\nzero-scale and full-scale calibrations, the user must ensure that the\noffset range plus the span range does exceed 1.05 × VREF/gain.\nThis is best illustrated by looking at a few examples.\nIf the device is used in unipolar mode with a required span of 0.8 ×\nVREF/gain, the offset range that the system calibration can handle is\nfrom −1.05 × VREF/gain to +0.25 × VREF/gain. If the device is used\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nADC CIRCUIT INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 54 of 95in unipolar mode with a required span of VREF/gain, the offset range\nthat the system calibration can handle is from −1.05 × VREF/gain to\n+0.05 × VREF/gain. Similarly, if the device is used in unipolar mode\nand required to remove an offset of 0.2 × VREF/gain, the span range\nthat the system calibration can handle is 0.85 × VREF/gain.\nIf the device is used in bipolar mode with a required span of ±0.4\n× VREF/gain, then the offset range that the system calibration can\nhandle is from −0.65 × VREF/gain to +0.65 × VREF/gain. If the device\nis used in bipolar mode with a required span of ±VREF/gain, the\noffset range the system calibration can handle is from −0.05 ×\nVREF/gain to +0.05 × VREF/gain. Similarly, if the device is used in\nbipolar mode and required to remove an offset of ±0.2 × VREF/gain,\nthe span range that the system calibration can handle is ±0.85 ×\nVREF/gain.\nSYSTEM SYNCHRONIZATION\nThe SYNC  input allows the user to reset the modulator and the\ndigital filter without affecting any of the setup conditions on the\ndevice. This allows the user to start gathering samples of the\nanalog input from a known point in time, that is, the rising edge\nof SYNC . Take SYNC  low for at least four master clock cycles to\nimplement the synchronization function.\nIf multiple AD7124-8  devices are operated from a common master\nclock, they can be synchronized so that their data registers are\nupdated simultaneously. A falling edge on the SYNC  pin resets the\ndigital filter and the analog modulator and places the AD7124-8into a consistent, known state. While the SYNC  pin is low, the\nAD7124-8  is maintained in this state. On the SYNC  rising edge,\nthe modulator and filter exit this reset state and, on the next clock\nedge, the device starts to gather input samples again. In a system\nusing multiple AD7124-8  devices, a common signal to their SYNC\npins synchronizes their operation. This is normally performed after\neach AD7124-8  has performed its own calibration or has calibration\ncoefficients loaded into its calibration registers. The conversions\nfrom the AD7124-8  devices are then synchronized.\nThe device exits reset on the master clock falling edge following\nthe SYNC  low to high transition. Therefore, when multiple devices\nare being synchronized, pull the SYNC  pin high on the master clock\nrising edge to ensure that all devices begin sampling on the master\nclock falling edge. If the SYNC  pin is not taken high in sufficient\ntime, it is possible to have a difference of one master clock cycle\nbetween the devices; that is, the instant at which conversions are\navailable differs from device to device by a maximum of one master\nclock cycle.\nThe SYNC  pin can also be used as a start conversion command.\nIn this mode, the rising edge of SYNC  starts conversion and the\nfalling edge of RDY indicates when the conversion is complete. The\nsettling time of the filter must be allowed for each data register\nupdate. For example, if the ADC is configured to use the sinc4\nfilter and zero latency is disabled, the settling time equals 4/fADC\nwhere fADC is the output data rate when continuously converting on\na single channel.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nDIGITAL FILTER\nanalog.com Rev.

For all other modes, a region of ±1 Hz around 50 Hz and/or\n60 Hz is used.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nDIAGNOSTICS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 68 of 95The AD7124-8  has numerous diagnostic functions on chip. Use\nthese features to ensure\n►Read/write operations are to valid registers only\n►Only valid data is written to the on-chip registers\n►Appropriate decoupling is used on the LDOs\n►The external reference, if used, is present\n►The ADC modulator and filter are working within specification\nSIGNAL CHAIN CHECK\nFunctions such as the reference and power supply voltages can\nbe selected as inputs to the ADC. The AD7124-8  can therefore\ncheck the voltages connected to the device. The AD7124-8  also\ngenerates an internal 20 mV signal that can be applied internally to\na channel by selecting the V_20MV_P to V_20MV_M channel in the\nchannel register. The internal 20 mV uses a common-mode voltage\nof 10 mV. Therefore, the absolute voltage of V_20MV_M is AVSS.\nIf the AINM_UV_ERR function is enabled, the AINM_UV_ERR flag\nmay be set when the internal 20 mV is being measured. For this\nreason, ignore the AINM_UV_ERR flag status when converting the\ninternal 20 mV signal. The PGA can be checked using this function.\nAs the PGA setting is increased, for example, the signal as a\npercent of the analog input range is increased by a factor of two.\nThis allows the user to check that the PGA is functioning correctly.\nNote that the internal 20 mV cannot be used to test the signal chain\nat a gain of 1, AIN_BUFM buffer enabled as the buffer requires 100\nmV of headroom. To test the signal chain for this configuration, the\npower supply or LDO can be selected as the analog input.\nREFERENCE DETECT\nThe AD7124-8  includes on-chip circuitry to detect if there is a valid\nreference for conversions or calibrations when the user selects\nan external reference as the reference source. This is a valuable\nfeature in applications such as RTDs or strain gages where the\nreference is derived externally.\nFigure 118. Reference Detect Circuitry\nThis feature is enabled when the REF_DET_ERR_EN bit in the\nERROR_EN register is set to 1. If the voltage between the selected\nREFINx(+) and REFINx( −) pins goes below 0.7 V, or either the\nREFINx(+) or REFINx( −) inputs are open circuit, the AD7124-8\ndetects that it no longer has a valid reference. In this case, the\nREF_DET_ERR bit in the error register is set to 1. The ERR bit in\nthe status register is also set.\nIf the AD7124-8  is performing normal conversions and the\nREF_DET_ERR bit becomes active, the conversion results revert\nto all 1s. Therefore, it is not necessary to continuously monitor the\nstatus of the REF_DET_ERR bit when performing conversions. It isonly necessary to verify its status if the conversion result read from\nthe ADC data register is all 1s.\nIf the AD7124-8  is performing either offset or full-scale calibrations\nand the REF_DET_ERR bit becomes active, the updating of the\nrespective calibration register is inhibited to avoid loading incorrect\ncoefficients to the register, and the REF_DET_ERR bit is set. If\nthe user is concerned about verifying that a valid reference is in\nplace every time a calibration is performed, check the status of the\nREF_DET_ERR bit at the end of the calibration cycle.\nThe reference detect flag may be set when the device exits of\nstandby mode. Therefore, read the error register after exiting stand-\nby mode to reset the flag to 0.\nCALIBRATION, CONVERSION, AND\nSATURATION ERRORS\nThe conversion process and calibration process can also be\nmonitored by the AD7124-8 . These diagnostics check the an-\nalog input used as well as the modulator and digital filter\nduring conversions or calibration. The functions can be ena-\nbled using the ADC_CAL_ERR_EN, ADC_CONV_ERR_EN, and\nADC_SAT_ERR_EN bits in the ERROR_EN register. With these\nfunctions enabled, the ADC_ CAL_ERR, ADC_CONV_ERR, and\nADC_SAT_ERR bits are set if an error occurs.\nThe ADC_CONV_ERR flag is set if there is an overflow or under-\nflow in the digital filter. The ADC conversion clamps to all 0s or all\n1s also. This flag is updated in conjunction with the update of the\ndata register and can be cleared only by a read of the error register.\nThe ADC_SAT_ERR flag is set if the modulator outputs 20 consec-\nutive 1s or 0s. This indicates that the modulator has saturated.\nWhen an offset calibration is performed, the resulting offset coeffi-\ncient must be between 0x7FFFF and 0xF80000. If the coefficient\nis outside this range, the offset register is not updated and the\nADC_CAL_ERR flag is set. During a full-scale calibration, overflow\nof the digital filter is checked. If an overflow occurs, the error flag is\nset and the gain register is not updated.\nOVERVOLTAGE/UNDERVOLTAGE DETECTION\nThe overvoltage/undervoltage monitors check the absolute voltage\non the AINx analog input pins. The absolute voltage must be within\nspecification to meet the datasheet specifications. If the ADC is\noperated outside the datasheet limits, linearity degrades.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nDIAGNOSTICS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 69 of 95Figure 119. Analog Input Overvoltage/Undervoltage Monitors\nThe positive (AINP) and negative (AINM) analog inputs can\nbe separately checked for overvoltages and undervoltages.\nThe AINP_OV_ERR_EN and AINP_UV_ERR_EN bits in the ER-\nROR_EN register enable the overvoltage/undervoltage diagnos-\ntics respectively. An overvoltage is flagged when the voltage on\nAINP exceeds AVDD while an undervoltage is flagged when the\nvoltage on AINP goes below AVSS. Similarly, an overvoltage/un-\ndervoltage check on the negative analog input pin is enabled\nusing the AINM_OV_ERR_EN and AINM_UV_ ERR_EN bits in\nthe ERROR_EN register. The error flags are AINP_OV_ERR,\nAINP_UV_ERR, AINM_OV_ERR, and AINM_UV_ERR in the error\nregister.\nWhen this function is enabled, the corresponding flags may be set\nin the error register. Therefore, the user must read the error register\nwhen the overvoltage/undervoltage checks are enabled to ensure\nthat the flags are reset to 0.\nPOWER SUPPLY MONITORS\nAlong with converting external voltages, the ADC can monitor the\nvoltage on the AVDD pin and the IOVDD pin. When the inputs of\nAVDD to AVSS or IOVDD to DGND are selected, the voltage (AVDD\nto AVSS or IOVDD to DGND) is internally attenuated by 6, and the\nresulting voltage is applied to the Σ-Δ modulator. This is useful\nbecause variations in the power supply voltage can be monitored.\nLDO MONITORING\nThere are several LDO checks included on the AD7124-8 . Like the\nexternal power supplies, the voltage generated by the analog and\ndigital LDOs are selectable as inputs to the ADC. In addition, the\nAD7124-8  can continuously monitor the LDO voltages.\nPower Supply Monitor\nThe voltage generated by the ALDO and DLDO can be\nmonitored by enabling the ALDO_PSM_ERR_EN bit and the\nDLDO_PSM_ERR_EN bit, respectively, in the ERROR_EN regis-\nter. When enabled, the output voltage of the LDO is continuous-\nly monitored. If the ALDO voltage drops below 1.6 V, the AL-\nDO_PSM_ERR flag is asserted. If the DLDO voltage drops below\n1.55 V, the DLDO_PSM_ERR flag is asserted. The bit remains setuntil the corresponding LDO voltage recovers. However, the bit is\nonly cleared when the error register is read.\n1.6VOVERVOL TAGE\nCOMPARATOR\nALDO\nSET IF ALDO OUTPUT VOL TAGE IS\nLESS THAN 1.6V\n130\nFigure 120. Analog LDO Monitor\n1.55VOVERVOL TAGE\nCOMPARATOR\nDLDO\nSET IF DLDO OUTPUT VOL TAGE IS\nLESS THAN 1.55V\n131\nFigure 121. Digital LDO Monitor\nThe AD7124-8  can also test the circuitry used for the power\nsupply monitoring. When the ALDO_PSM_TRIP_TEST_EN or\nDLDO_PSM_TRIP_TEST_EN bits are set, the input to the test\ncircuitry is tied to GND rather than the LDO output. Set the corre-\nsponding ALDO_PSM_ERR or DLDO_PSM_ERR bit.\nLDO Capacitor Detect\nThe analog and digital LDOs require an external decoupling ca-\npacitor of 0.1 µF. The AD7124-8  can check for the presence of\nthis decoupling capacitor. Using the LDO_CAP_CHK bits in the\nERROR_EN register, the LDO being checked is turned off and the\nvoltage at the LDO output is monitored. If the voltage falls, this is\nconsidered a fail and the LDO_CAP_ERR bit in the error register is\nset. Note that a missing decoupling capacitor can cause the ADC\nto reset. However, this is easily detectable at the system level by\nreading back registers.\nOnly the analog LDO or digital LDO can be tested for the presence\nof the decoupling capacitor at any one time. This test also interferes\nwith the conversion process.\nThe circuitry used to check for missing decoupling capacitors\ncan also be tested by the AD7124-8 . When the LDO_CAP_\nCHK_TEST_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register is set, the decou-\npling capacitor is internally disconnected from the LDO, forcing\na fault condition. Therefore, when the LDO capacitor test is per-\nformed, a fault condition is reported, that is, the LDO_CAP_ERR bit\nin the error register is set.\nMCLK COUNTER\nA stable master clock is important as the output data rate, filter\nsettling time, and the filter notch frequencies are dependent on the\nmaster clock. The AD7124-8  allows the user to monitor the master\nclock. When the MCLK_CNT_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register is\nset, the MCLK_COUNT register increments by 1 every 131 master\nclock cycles. The user can monitor this register over a fixed period\nof time. The master clock frequency can be determined from the\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nDIAGNOSTICS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 70 of 95result in the MCLK_COUNT register. The MCLK_COUNT register\nwraps around after it reaches its maximum value.\nNote that the incrementation of the register is asynchronous to\nthe register read. If a register read coincides with the register\nincrementation, it is possible to read an invalid value. To prevent\nthis, read the register four times rather than once, then read the\nregister four times again at a later point. By reading four values, it is\npossible to identify the correct register value at the start and at the\nend of the timing instants.\nSPI SCLK COUNTER\nThe SPI SCLK counter counts the number of SCLK pulses used in\neach read and write operation. CS must frame every read and write\noperation when this function is used. All read and write operations\nare multiples of eight SCLK pulses (8, 16, 32, 40, 48). If the SCLK\ncounter counts the SCLK pulses and the result is not a multiple\nof eight, an error is flagged; the SPI_SCLK_CNT_ERR bit in the\nerror register is set. If a write operation is being performed and\nthe SCLK contains an incorrect number of SCLK pulses, the value\nis not written to the addressed register and the write operation is\naborted.\nThe SCLK counter is enabled by setting the SPI_SCLK_\nCNT_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register.\nSPI READ/WRITE ERRORS\nAlong with the SCLK counter, the AD7124-8  can also check the\nread and write operations to ensure that valid registers are be-\ning addressed. When the SPI_READ_ERR_EN bit or the SPI_\nWRITE_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register are set, the\nAD7124-8  checks the address of the read/write operations. If the\nuser attempts to write to or read from any register other than the\nuser registers described in this data sheet, an error is flagged;\nthe SPI_READ_ERR bit or the SPI_WRITE_ERR bit in the error\nregister is set and the read/write operation is aborted.\nThis function, along with the SCLK counter and the CRC, makes\nthe serial interface more robust. Invalid registers are not written\nto or read from. An incorrect number of SCLK pulses can cause\nthe serial interface to go asynchronous and incorrect registers to\nbe accessed. The AD7124-8  protects against these issues via the\ndiagnostics.\nSPI_IGNORE ERROR\nAt certain times, the on-chip registers are not accessible. For\nexample, during power-up, the on-chip registers are set to their\ndefault values. The user must wait until this operation is complete\nbefore writing to registers. Also, when offset or gain calibrations are\nbeing performed, registers cannot be accessed. If the user writes\nto registers during these busy periods, the SPI_IGNORE_ERR flag\nis set, indicating that the ADC is busy and the write operation is\nignored. The SPI_IGNORE_ERR flag is cleared when the bit is\nread. This diagnostic is enabled by default. The function can bedisabled using the SPI_IGNORE_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN\nregister.\nCHECKSUM PROTECTION\nThe AD7124-8  has a checksum mode that can be used to improve\ninterface robustness. Using the checksum ensures that only valid\ndata is written to a register and allows data read from a register\nto be validated. If an error occurs during a register write, the\nCRC_ERR bit is set in the error register. However, to ensure that\nthe register write was successful, read back the register and verify\nthe checksum.\nFor CRC checksum calculations, the following polynomial is always\nused:\nx8 + x2 + x + 1\nThe CRC_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register enables and\ndisables the checksum.\nThe checksum is appended to the end of each read and write\ntransaction. The checksum calculation for the write transaction is\ncalculated using the 8-bit command word and the 8-bit to 24-bit\ndata. For a read transaction, the checksum is calculated using the\ncommand word and the 8-bit to 32-bit data output. Figure 122  and\nFigure 123  show SPI write and read transactions, respectively.\n8-BIT COMMAND 8-BIT CRC UP TO 24-BIT INPUT\nCS DATA CRCCS\nDIN\nSCLK\n132\nFigure 122.

SPI Read Transaction with CRC\nIf checksum protection is enabled when continuous read mode is\nactive, there is an implied command of 0x99 before every data\ntransmission that must be accounted for when calculating the\nchecksum value. This ensures a nonzero checksum value even if\nthe ADC data equals 0x000000.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nDIAGNOSTICS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 71 of 95MEMORY MAP CHECKSUM PROTECTION\nFor added robustness, a CRC calculation is performed on the\non-chip registers as well. The status register, data register, error\nregister, and MCLK counter register are not included in this check\nbecause their contents change continuously. The CRC is performed\nat a rate of 1/2400 seconds. Each time that the memory map is\naccessed, the CRC is recalculated. Events that cause the CRC to\nbe recalculated are\n►A user write\n►An offset/full-scale calibration\n►When the device is operated in single conversion mode and the\nADC goes into standby mode following the completion of the\nconversion\n►When exiting continuous read mode (the CONT_READ bit in the\nADC_CONTROL register is set to 0)\nThe memory map CRC function is enabled by setting the MM_\nCRC_ERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register to 1. If an error\noccurs, the MM_CRC_ERR bit in the error register is set to 1.\nROM CHECKSUM PROTECTION\nOn power-up, all registers are set to default values. These default\nvalues are held in read only memory (ROM). For added robustness,a CRC calculation is performed on the ROM contents as well. The\nCRC is performed on power-up.\nThe ROM CRC function is enabled by setting the ROM_CRC_\nERR_EN bit in the ERROR_EN register to 1. If an error occurs, the\nROM_CRC_ERR bit in the error register is set to 1.\nWhen this function is enabled, the internal master clock, if enabled,\nremains active in the standby mode.\nCRC Calculation\nThe checksum, which is 8 bits wide, is generated using the polyno-\nmial\nx8 + x2 + x + 1\nTo generate the checksum, the data is left shifted by eight bits to\ncreate a number ending in eight Logic 0s. The polynomial is aligned\nso that its MSB is adjacent to the leftmost Logic 1 of the data. An\nXOR (exclusive OR) function is applied to the data to produce a\nnew, shorter number. The polynomial is again aligned so that its\nMSB is adjacent to the leftmost Logic 1 of the new result, and the\nprocedure is repeated. This process is repeated until the original\ndata is reduced to a value less than the polynomial. This is the 8-bit\nchecksum.\nExample of a Polynomial CRC Calculation—24-Bit Word: 0x654321 (8-Bit Command and 16-Bit Data)\nAn example of generating the 8-bit checksum using the polynomial based checksum is as follows:\nInitial value       011001010100001100100001\n                    01100101010000110010000100000000        left shifted eight bits\nx8 + x2 + x + 1 =             100000111        polynomial \n     100100100000110010000100000000         XOR result\n     100000111                              polynomial \n           100011000110010000100000000      XOR result\n           100000111                        polynomial \n               11111110010000100000000      XOR result \n               100000111                    polynomial value \n                1111101110000100000000      XOR result\n                100000111                   polynomial value \n                 111100000000100000000      XOR result \n                 100000111                  polynomial value \n                  11100111000100000000      XOR result \n                  100000111                 polynomial value \n                   1100100100100000000      XOR result\n                   100000111                polynomial value \n                      100101010100000000    XOR result\n                      100000111             polynomial value \n                       101101100000000      XOR result\n                       100000111            polynomial value \n                        1101011000000       XOR result\n                        100000111           polynomial value \n                          101010110000      XOR result\n                          100000111         polynomial value \nData Sheet AD7124-8\nDIAGNOSTICS\nanalog.com Rev.

One generator sources\ncurrent from AVDD to AINP, and one sinks current from AINM to\nAVSS. These currents enable open wire detection.\nX-MUXAVDD\nAVSSBURNOUT\nDETECTPGA1\n134\nFigure 124. Burnout Currents\nThe currents are switched to the selected analog input pair. Both\ncurrents are either on or off. The burnout bits in the configuration\nregister enable/disable the burnout currents along with setting the\namplitude. Use these currents to verify that an external transducer\nis still operational before attempting to take measurements on that\nchannel. After the burnout currents are turned on, they flow in\nthe external transducer circuit, and a measurement of the input\nvoltage on the analog input channel can be taken. If the resulting\nvoltage measured is near full scale, the user must verify why this\nis the case. A near full-scale reading can mean that the front-end\nsensor is open circuit. It can also mean that the front-end sensor\nis overloaded and is justified in outputting full scale, or that the\nreference may be absent and the REF_DET_ERR bit is set, thus\nclamping the data to all 1s.\nWhen a conversion is close to full scale, the user must check these\nthree cases before making a judgment. If the voltage measured\nis 0 V, it may indicate that the transducer has short circuited. For\nnormal operation, these burnout currents are turned off by setting\nthe burnout bits to zero. The current sources work over the normal\nabsolute input voltage range specifications with buffers on.\nTEMPERATURE SENSOR\nEmbedded in the AD7124-8  is a temperature sensor that is useful\nto monitor the die temperature. This is selected using the AINP[4:0]\nand AINM[4:0] bits in the channel register. Thus, the analog input is\nTemperature Sensor – AVSS. Because AINM is connected to AVSS\nfor the measurement, the AINM_UV_ERR flag may be set whenthe internal temperature measurement is being performed if the\nflag is enabled. Therefore, ignore the AINM_UV_ERR flag for the\ntemperature sensor measurement.\nThe sensitivity is 13,584 codes/°C, approximately. The equation for\nthe temperature sensor is\nTemperature (°C) = (( Conversion − 0x800000)/13,584) − 272.5\nThe temperature sensor has an accuracy of ±0.5°C typically.\n –  0  .  6  –  0  .  4  –  0  .  2  0  0  .  2  0  .  4  0  .  6  0  .  8  1  .  0  1  .  2 \n –  4  0  –  3  0  –  2  0  –  1  0  0  1  5  2  5  4  0  5  0  6  0  7  0  8  5  9  5  1  0  5  1  1  5  1  2  5  T  E  M  P  E  R  A  T  U  R  E     S  E  N  S  O  R     E  R  R  O  R     (  %  ) \n T  E  M  P  E  R  A  T  U  R  E     (  °  C  )  3  2     U  N  I  T  S \n 1  3  0  4  8  -  1  3  5 \nFigure 125. Temperature Sensor Error vs. Temperature\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT\nanalog.com Rev. F | 73 of 95The analog inputs and reference inputs are differential and, there-\nfore, most of the voltages in the analog modulator are common-\nmode voltages. The high common-mode rejection of the device\nremoves common-mode noise on these inputs. The analog and\ndigital supplies to the AD7124-8  are independent and separately\npinned out to minimize coupling between the analog and digital\nsections of the device. The digital filter provides rejection of broad-\nband noise on the power supplies, except at integer multiples of the\nmaster clock frequency.\nThe digital filter also removes noise from the analog and reference\ninputs, provided that these noise sources do not saturate the\nanalog modulator. As a result, the AD7124-8  is more immune to\nnoise interference than a conventional high resolution converter.\nHowever, because the resolution of the AD7124-8  is high and the\nnoise levels from the converter are so low, care must be taken with\nregard to grounding and layout.\nThe PCB that houses the ADC must be designed so that the analog\nand digital sections are separated and confined to certain areas of\nthe board. A minimum etch technique is generally best for ground\nplanes because it results in the best shielding.\nIn any layout, the user must keep in mind the flow of currents\nin the system, ensuring that the paths for all return currents are\nas close as possible to the paths the currents took to reach their\ndestinations.\nAvoid running digital lines under the device because this couples\nnoise onto the die and allows the analog ground plane to run under\nthe AD7124-8  to prevent noise coupling. The power supply lines\nto the AD7124-8  must use as wide a trace as possible to providelow impedance paths and reduce glitches on the power supply\nline. Shield fast switching signals like clocks with digital ground to\nprevent radiating noise to other sections of the board and never\nrun clock signals near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital\nand analog signals. Run traces on opposite sides of the board at\nright angles to each other. This reduces the effects of feedthrough\non the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best but is\nnot always possible with a double-sided board. In this technique,\nthe component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes,\nwhereas signals are placed on the solder side.\nGood decoupling is important when using high resolution ADCs.\nThe AD7124-8  has two power supply pins—AVDD and IOVDD. The\nAVDD pin is referenced to AVSS, and the IOVDD pin is referenced to\nDGND. Decouple AVDD with a 1 µF tantalum capacitor in parallel\nwith a 0.1 µF capacitor to AVSS on each pin. Place the 0.1 µF\ncapacitor as close as possible to the device on each supply, ideally\nright up against the device. Decouple IOVDD with a 1 µF tantalum\ncapacitor in parallel with a 0.1 µF capacitor to DGND. All analog\ninputs must be decoupled to AVSS. If an external reference is used,\ndecouple the REFINx(+) and REFINx( −) pins to AVSS.\nThe AD7124-8  also has two on-board LDO regulators—one that\nregulates the AVDD supply and one that regulates the IOVDD supply.\nFor the REGCAPA pin, it is recommended that a 0.1 µF capacitor to\nAVSS be used. Similarly, for the REGCAPD pin, it is recommended\nthat a 0.1 µF capacitor to DGND be used.\nIf using the AD7124-8  with split supply operation, a separate plane\nmust be used for AVSS.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 74 of 95The AD7124-8  offers a low cost, high resolution analog-to-digital\nfunction. Because the analog-to-digital function is provided by a\nΣ-Δ architecture, the device is more immune to noisy environments,\nmaking it ideal for use in sensor measurement, and industrial and\nprocess control applications.\nTEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT USING A\nTHERMOCOUPLE\nFigure 126  outlines a connection from a thermocouple to the\nAD7124-8 . In a thermocouple application, the voltage generated\nby the thermocouple is measured with respect to an absolute\nreference; thus, the internal reference is used for this conversion.\nThe cold junction measurement uses a ratiometric configuration, so\nthe reference is provided externally.\nBecause the signal from the thermocouple is small, the AD7124-8\nis operated with the PGA enabled to amplify the signal from the\nthermocouple. As the input channel is buffered, large decoupling\ncapacitors can be placed on the front end to eliminate any noise\npickup that may be present in the thermocouple leads. The bias\nvoltage generator provides a common-mode voltage so that the\nvoltage generated by the thermocouple is biased up to (AVDD\n− AVSS)/2. For thermocouple voltages that are centered about\nground, the AD7124-8  can be operated with a split power supply\n(±1.8 V).\nThe cold junction compensation is performed using a thermistor in\nFigure 126 . The on-chip excitation current supplies the thermistor.\nIn addition, the reference voltage for the cold junction measurement\nis derived from a precision resistor in series with the thermistor.\nThis allows a ratiometric measurement so that variation of the\nexcitation current has no effect on the measurement (it is the ratio\nof the precision reference resistance to the thermistor resistance\nthat is measured).\nMost conversions are read from the thermocouple, with the cold\njunction being read only periodically as the cold junction tempera-ture is stable or slow moving. If a T-type thermocouple is used, it\ncan measure a temperature from −200°C to +400°C. The voltage\ngenerated over this temperature range is −8.6 mV to +17.2 mV.\nThe AD7124-8  internal reference equals 2.5 V. Therefore, the PGA\nis set to 128. If the thermocouple uses the AIN0/AIN1 channel\nand the thermistor is connected to the AIN12/AIN13 channel, the\nconversion process is as follows:\n1.Reset the ADC.\n2.Select the power mode.\nSet the CHANNEL_0 register analog input to AIN0/AIN1. As-\nsign Setup 0 to this channel. Configure Setup 0 to have a gain\nof 128 and select the internal reference. Select the filter type\nand set the output data rate.\n3.Enable VBIAS on AIN0.\n4.Set the CHANNEL_1 register analog input to AIN12/AIN13.\nAssign Setup 1 to this channel. Configure Setup 1 to have a\ngain of 1 and select the external reference REFIN2(±).

Thermocouple Application\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 75 of 95The external antialias filter is omitted for clarity. However, such a\nfilter is required to reject any interference at the modulator frequen-\ncy and multiples of the modulator frequency. In addition, some\nfiltering may be needed for EMI purposes. Both the analog inputs\nand the reference inputs can be buffered, which allows the user to\nconnect any RC combination to the reference or analog input pins.\nNote that the reference inputs require 100 mV of headroom when\nbuffered so a headroom resistor is then needed to bias REFIN2( −)\nappropriately.\nThe required power mode depends on the performance required\nfrom the system along with the current consumption allowance for\nthe system. In a field transmitter, low current consumption is essen-\ntial. In this application, the low power mode or mid power mode is\nmost suitable. In process control applications, power consumption\nis not a priority. Thus, full power mode may be selected. The full\npower mode offers higher throughput and lower noise.\nThe AD7124-8  on-chip diagnostics allow the user to check the\ncircuit connections, monitor power supply, reference, and LDO vol-\ntages, check all conversions and calibrations for any errors, as well\nas monitor any read/write operations. In thermocouple applications,\nthe circuit connections are verified using the reference detect and\nthe burnout currents. The REF_DET_ERR flag is set if the external\nreference REFIN2(±) is missing. The burnout currents (available in\nthe configuration registers) detect an open wire. For example, if\nthe thermocouple is not connected and the burnout currents are\nenabled on the channel, the ADC outputs a conversion that is equal\nto or close to full scale. For best performance, enable the burnout\ncurrents periodically to check the connections but disable them as\nsoon as the connections are verified for they add an error to the\nconversions. The decoupling capacitors on the LDOs can also be\nchecked. The ADC indicates if the capacitor is not present.\nAs part of the conversion process, the analog input overvoltage/un-\ndervoltage monitors are useful for detecting any excessive voltages\non AINP and AINM. The power supply voltages and reference\nvoltages are selectable as inputs to the ADC. Thus, the user\ncan periodically check these voltages to confirm whether they are\nwithin the system specification. Also, the user can check that the\nLDO voltages are within specification. The conversion process and\ncalibration process can also be checked. This ensures that any\ninvalid conversions or calibrations are flagged to the user.\nFinally, the CRC check, SCLK counter, and the SPI read/write\nchecks make the interface more robust as any read/write operation\nthat is not valid is detected. The CRC check highlights if any bits\nare corrupted when being transmitted between the processor and\nthe ADC.\nTEMPERATURE MEASUREMENT USING AN\nRTD\nTo optimize a 3-wire RTD configuration, two identically matched\ncurrent sources are required. The AD7124-8 , which contains two\nwell matched current sources, is ideally suited to these applications.\nOne possible 3-wire configuration is shown in Figure 127 . In this3-wire configuration, the lead resistances result in errors if only one\ncurrent (output at AIN0) is used, as the excitation current flows\nthrough RL1, developing a voltage error between AIN1 and AIN2.\nIn the scheme outlined, the second RTD current source (available\nat AIN3) compensates for the error introduced by the excitation\ncurrent flowing through RL1. The second RTD current flows through\nRL2. Assuming that RL1 and RL2 are equal (the leads are normally\nof the same material and of equal length) and that the excitation\ncurrents match, the error voltage across RL2 equals the error volt-\nage across RL1, and no error voltage is developed between AIN1\nand AIN2. Twice the voltage is developed across RL3; however,\nbecause this is a common-mode voltage it does not introduce\nerrors. The reference voltage for the AD7124-8  is also generated\nusing one of the matched current sources. It is developed using\na precision resistor and applied to the differential reference pins\nof the ADC. This scheme ensures that the analog input voltage\nspan remains ratiometric to the reference voltage. Any errors in the\nanalog input voltage due to the temperature drift of the excitation\ncurrent are compensated by the variation of the reference voltage.\nAs an example, the PT100 measures temperature from −200°C to\n+600°C. The resistance is 100 Ω typically at 0°C and 313.71 Ω at\n600°C. If the 500 µA excitation currents are used, the maximum\nvoltage generated across the RTD when using the full temperature\nrange of the RTD is\n500 µA × 313.71 Ω = 156.86 mV\nThis is amplified to 2.51 V within the AD7124-8  if the gain is\nprogrammed to 16.\nThe voltage generated across the reference resistor must be at\nleast 2.51 V. Therefore, the reference resistor value must equal at\nleast\n2.51 V/500 µA = 5020 Ω\nTherefore, a 5.11 k Ω resistor can be used.\n5.11 k Ω × Excitation Current  = 5.11 k Ω × 500 µA = 2.555 V\nOne other consideration is the output compliance. The output com-\npliance equals AVDD − 0.37 V. If a 3.3 V analog supply is used, the\nvoltage at AIN0 must be less than (3.3 V − 0.37 V) = 2.93 V. From\nthe previous calculations, this specification is met because the\nmaximum voltage at AIN0 equals the voltage across the reference\nresistor plus the voltage across the RTD, which equals\n2.555 V + 156.86 mV = 2.712 V\nA typical procedure for reading the RTD is as follows:\n1.Reset the ADC.\n2.Select the power mode.\n3.Set the CHANNEL_0 register analog input to AIN1/AIN2. As-\nsign Setup 0 to this channel. Configure Setup 0 to have a gain\nof 16 and select the reference source REFIN2(±).

Read the conversion value.\n6.Repeat Step 4.\nIn the processor, implement the linearization routine for the PT100.\nThe external antialias filter is omitted for clarity. However, such a fil-\nter is required to reject any interference at the modulator frequency\nand multiples of the modulator frequency. Also, some filtering may\nbe needed for EMI purposes. Both the analog inputs and reference\ninputs can be buffered, which allows the user to connect any RC\ncombination to the reference or analog input pins.\nOn the AD7124-8 , the excitation currents can be made available at\nthe input pins, for example, the AIN3 pin can function as an analog\ninput as well as outputting the current source. This option allows\nmultiple sensors to be connected to the ADC using a minimum pin\ncount. However, the resistor of the antialiasing filter is in series with\nthe RTD. This introduces an error in the conversions as there is a\nvoltage generated across the antialiasing resistor. To minimize the\nerror, minimize the resistance of the antialiasing filter.\nThe power mode to use depends on the performance required from\nthe system along with the current consumption allowance for the\nsystem. In a field transmitter, low current consumption is essential.\nIn this application, the low power mode or mid power mode is most\nsuitable.

F | 77 of 95FLOWMETER\nFigure 128  shows the AD7124-8  being used in a flowmeter appli-\ncation that consists of two pressure transducers, with the rate\nof flow being equal to the pressure difference. The pressure trans-\nducers are arranged in a bridge network and give a differential\noutput voltage between its OUT+ and OUT − terminals. With rated\nfull-scale pressure (in this case, 300 mmHg) on the transducer, the\ndifferential output voltage is 3 mV/V of the input voltage (that is, the\nvoltage between the IN+ and IN − terminals).\nAssuming a 3 V excitation voltage, the full-scale output range from\nthe transducer is 9 mV. The excitation voltage for the bridge can\ndirectly provide the reference for the ADC, as the reference input\nrange includes the supply voltage.\nA second advantage of using the AD7124-8  in transducer-based\napplications is that the low-side power switch can be fully utilized\nin low power applications. The low-side power switch is connected\nin series with the cold side of the bridges. In normal operation,\nthe switch is closed and measurements are taken. In applications\nwhere power is of concern, the AD7124-8  can be placed in standby\nmode, thus significantly reducing the power consumed in the appli-\ncation. In addition, the low-side power switch can be opened while\nin standby mode, thus avoiding unnecessary power consumption by\nthe front-end transducers. When the device is taken out of standby\nmode, and the low-side power switch is closed, the user must\nensure that the front-end circuitry is fully settled before attempting\na read from the AD7124-8 . The power switch can be closed prior\nto taking the device out of standby, if needed. This allows time for\nthe sensor to power up and settle before the ADC powers up and\nbegins sampling the analog input.\nIn the diagram, temperature compensation is performed using a\nthermistor. The on-chip excitation current supplies the thermistor. In\naddition, the reference voltage for the temperature measurement is\nderived from a precision resistor in series with the thermistor. This\nallows a ratiometric measurement so that variation of the excitation\ncurrent has no effect on the measurement (it is the ratio of the\nprecision reference resistance to the thermistor resistance that is\nmeasured).\nIf the sensor sensitivity is 3 mV/V and the excitation voltage is 3 V,\nthe maximum output from the sensor is 9 mV. The AD7124-8  PGA\ncan be set to 128 to amplify the sensor signal.\nThe AD7124-8  PGA amplifies the signal to\n9 mV × 128 = 1.152 V\nThis value does not exceed the reference voltage (3 V).\nA typical procedure for reading the sensors is as follows:\n1.Reset the ADC.\n2.Select the power mode.\n3.Set the CHANNEL_0 register analog input to AIN0/AIN1. As-\nsign Setup 0 to this channel. Configure Setup 0 to have a gainof 128 and select the reference source to REFIN1(±).

As-\nsign Setup 0 to this channel (both channels use the same\nsetup).\n5.Set the CHANNEL_2 register analog input to AIN4/AIN5. As-\nsign Setup 1 to this channel. Configure Setup 1 to have a gain\nof 1 and select the reference source REFIN2(±). Select the filter\ntype and set the output data rate.\n6.Program the excitation current and output the current on the\nAIN4 pin.\n7.Enable both CHANNEL_0 and CHANNEL_1. Enable the DA-\nTA_STATUS bit to identify the channel from which the conver-\nsion originated. The ADC automatically sequences through\nthese channels.\n8.Wait until RDY goes low. Read the conversion value.\n9.Repeat Step 8 until the temperature is to be read (every 10\nconversions of the pressure sensor readings, for example).\n10.Disable CHANNEL_0 and CHANNEL_1. Enable CHANNEL_2.\n11.Wait until RDY goes low. Read the conversion.\n12.Repeat Step 6 to Step 10.\nIn the processor, the conversion information is converted to pres-\nsure and the flow rate can be calculated. The processor typically\ncontains a lookup table for each pressure sensor so its variation\nwith temperature can be compensated.\nThe external antialias filter is omitted for clarity. However, such a fil-\nter is required to reject any interference at the modulator frequency\nand multiples of the modulator frequency. Also, some filtering may\nbe needed for EMI purposes. Both the analog inputs and reference\ninputs can be buffered, which allows the user to connect any RC\ncombination to the reference or analog input pins.

All communications to the device must start with a write operation to the\ncommunications register. The data written to the communications register determines whether the next operation is a read or write operation,\nand to which register this operation takes place, the RS[5:0] bits selecting the register to be accessed.\nFor read or write operations, after the subsequent read or write operation to the selected register is complete, the interface returns to where it\nexpects a write operation to the communications register. This is the default state of the interface and, on power-up or after a reset, the ADC is\nin this default state waiting for a write operation to the communications register.\nIn situations where the interface sequence is lost, a write operation of at least 64 serial clock cycles with DIN high returns the ADC to this\ndefault state by resetting the entire device. Table 65  outlines the bit designations for the communications register. Bit 7 denotes the first bit of\nthe data stream.\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\nWEN (0) R/W (0) RS[5:0] (0)\nTable 65.

If a 1 is the first bit written, the\ndevice does not clock on to subsequent bits in the register. It stays at this bit location until a 0 is written to this bit. As soon as a 0 is written to\nthe WEN bit, the next seven bits are loaded to the communications register.\n6 R/W A 0 in this bit location indicates that the next operation is a write to a specified register. A 1 in this position indicates that the next operation is a\nread from the designated register.\n5:0 RS[5:0] Register address bits.

The RDY bit is set automatically after the ADC data\nregister is read or a period of time before the data register is updated with a new conversion result to indicate to the user not to read the\nconversion data. It is also set when the device is placed in power-down or standby mode. The end of a conversion is also indicated by the\nDOUT/ RDY pin. This pin can be used as an alternative to the status register for monitoring the ADC for conversion data.\n6 ERROR_FLAG ADC error bit. This bit indicates if one of the error bits has been asserted in the error register. This bit is high if one or more of the error bits\nin the error register has been set. This bit is cleared by a read of the error register.\n5 0 This bit is set to 0.\n4 POR_FLAG Power-on reset flag. This bit indicates that a power-on reset has occurred. A power-on reset occurs on power-up, when the power supply\nvoltage goes below a threshold voltage, when a reset is performed, and when coming out of power-down mode. The status register must be\nread to clear the bit.\n3:0 CH_ACTIVE These bits indicate which channel is being converted by the ADC.\n0000 = Channel 0.\n0001 = Channel 1.\n0010 = Channel 2.\n0011 = Channel 3.\n0100 = Channel 4.\n0101 = Channel 5.\n0110 = Channel 6.\n0111 = Channel 7.\n1000 = Channel 8.\n1001 = Channel 9.\n1010 = Channel 10.\n1011 = Channel 11.\n1100 = Channel 12.\n1101 = Channel 13.\n1110 = Channel 14.\n1111 = Channel 15.\nADC_CONTROL REGISTER\nRS[5:0] = 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1\nPower-On/Reset = 0x0000\nTable 67  outlines the bit designations for the register.

When DOUT_ RDY_DEL is cleared, the delay is 10 ns minimum. When\nDOUT_ RDY_DEL is set, the delay is increased to 100 ns minimum. This function is useful when CS is tied low (the CS_EN bit is\nset to 0).\n11 CONT_READ Continuous read of the data register. When this bit is set to 1 (and the data register is selected), the serial interface is configured\nso that the data register can be continuously read; that is, the contents of the data register are automatically placed on the DOUT\npin when the SCLK pulses are applied after the RDY pin goes low to indicate that a conversion is complete. The communications\nregister does not have to be written to for subsequent data reads. To enable continuous read, the CONT_READ bit is set. To\ndisable continuous read, write a read data command while the DOUT/ RDY pin is low. While continuous read is enabled, the ADC\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nON-CHIP REGISTERS\nanalog.com Rev.

Additionally, a reset occurs if 64\nconsecutive 1s occur on DIN; therefore, hold DIN low until an instruction is written to the device.\n10 DATA_STATUS This bit enables the transmission of the status register contents after each data register read. When DATA_STATUS is set, the\ncontents of the status register are transmitted along with each data register read. This function is useful when several channels are\nselected because the status register identifies the channel to which the data register value corresponds.\n9 CS_EN This bit controls the operation of the DOUT/ RDY pin during read operations.\nWhen CS_EN is cleared, the DOUT pin returns to being a RDY pin within nanoseconds of the SCLK inactive edge (the delay is\ndetermined by the DOUT_ RDY_DEL bit).\nWhen set, the DOUT/ RDY pin continues to output the LSB of the register being read until CS is taken high. CS must frame all\nread operations when CS_EN is set.

When this bit is set, the internal reference is enabled and available at the REFOUT pin. When\nthis bit is cleared, the internal reference is disabled.\n7:6 POWER_MODE Power Mode Select. These bits select the power mode. The current consumption and output data rate ranges are dependent on the\npower mode.\n00 = low power.\n01 = mid power.\n10 = full power.\n11 = full power.\n5:2 Mode These bits control the mode of operation for ADC. See Table 68 .\n1:0 CLK_SEL These bits select the clock source for the ADC. Either the on-chip 614.4 kHz clock can be used or an external clock can be used.\nThe ability to use an external clock allows several AD7124-8  devices to be synchronized. Also, 50 Hz and 60 Hz rejection is\nimproved when an accurate external clock drives the ADC.\n00 = internal 614.4 kHz clock. The internal clock is not available at the CLK pin.\n01 = internal 614.4 kHz clock. This clock is available at the CLK pin.\n10 = external 614.4 kHz clock.\n11 = external clock. The external clock is divided by 4 within the AD7124-8 .\nTable 68. Operating Modes\nMode Value Description\n0000 Continuous conversion mode (default). In continuous conversion mode, the ADC continuously performs conversions and places the result in the data register.\nRDY goes low when a conversion is complete. The user can read these conversions by placing the device in continuous read mode whereby the conversions\nare automatically placed on the DOUT line when SCLK pulses are applied. Alternatively, the user can instruct the ADC to output the conversion by writing to the\ncommunications register. After power-on, a reset, or a reconfiguration of the ADC, the complete settling time of the filter is required to generate the first valid\nconversion. Subsequent conversions are available at the selected output data rate, which is dependent on filter choice.\n0001 Single conversion mode. When single conversion mode is selected, the ADC powers up and performs a single conversion on the selected channel. The\nconversion requires the complete settling time of the filter. The conversion result is placed in the data register, RDY goes low, and the ADC returns to standby\nmode. The conversion remains in the data register and RDY remains active (low) until the data is read or another conversion is performed.\n0010 Standby mode. In standby mode, all sections of the AD7124-8  can be powered down except the LDOs. The internal reference, on ‑chip oscillator, low-side power\nswitch, and bias voltage generator can be enabled or disabled while in standby mode. The on ‑chip registers retain their contents in standby mode.\nAny enabled diagnostics remain active when the ADC is in standby mode. The diagnostics can be enabled/disabled while in standby mode. However, any\ndiagnostics that require the master clock (reference detect, undervoltage/overvoltage detection, LDO trip tests, memory map CRC, and MCLK counter) must be\nenabled when the ADC is in continuous conversion mode or idle mode; these diagnostics do not function if enabled in standby mode.\n0011 Power-down mode. In power-down mode, all the AD7124-8  circuitry is powered down, including the current sources, power switch, burnout currents, bias voltage\ngenerator, and clock circuitry. The LDOs are also powered down. In power-down mode, the on-chip registers do not retain their contents. Therefore, coming out\nof power-down mode, all registers must be reprogrammed.\n0100 Idle mode. In idle mode, the ADC filter and modulator are held in a reset state even though the modulator clocks continue to be provided.\n0101 Internal zero-scale (offset) calibration. An internal short is automatically connected to the input. RDY goes high when the calibration is initiated and returns low\nwhen the calibration is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following a calibration. The measured offset coefficient is placed in the offset register of the\nselected channel. Select only one channel when zero-scale calibration is being performed. An internal zero-scale calibration takes a time of one settling period to\nbe performed.\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nON-CHIP REGISTERS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 83 of 95Table 68. Operating Modes  (Continued)\nMode Value Description\n0110 Internal full-scale (gain) calibration. A full-scale input voltage is automatically connected to the selected analog input for this calibration. RDY goes high when\nthe calibration is initiated and returns low when the calibration is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following a calibration. The measured full-scale\ncoefficient is placed in the gain register of the selected channel. A full-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is changed to minimize\nthe full-scale error. Select only one channel when full-scale calibration is being performed. The AD7124-8  is factory calibrated at a gain of 1. Further internal\nfull ‑scale calibrations at a gain of 1 are not supported. An internal full-scale calibration (gain > 1) takes a time of four settling periods.\nInternal full-scale calibrations cannot be performed in the full power mode. So, if using the full-power mode, select mid or low power mode for the internal\nfull-scale calibration. This calibration is valid in full power mode as the same reference and gain are used. When performing internal zero-scale and internal\nfull-scale calibrations, the internal full-scale calibration must be performed before the internal zero-scale calibration. Therefore, write 0x800000 to the offset\nregister before performing any internal full-scale calibration, which resets the offset register to its default value.\n0111 System zero-scale (offset) calibration. Connect the system zero-scale input to the channel input pins of the selected channel. RDY goes high when the\ncalibration is initiated and returns low when the calibration is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following a calibration. The measured offset coefficient\nis placed in the offset register of the selected channel. A system zero-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is changed. Select only one\nchannel when full-scale calibration is being performed. A system zero-scale calibration takes a time of one settling period to be performed.\n1000 System full-scale (gain) calibration. Connect the system full-scale input to the channel input pins of the selected channel. RDY goes high when the calibration is\ninitiated and returns low when the calibration is complete. The ADC is placed in idle mode following a calibration. The measured full-scale coefficient is placed in\nthe gain register of the selected channel. A full-scale calibration is required each time the gain of a channel is changed. Select only one channel when full-scale\ncalibration is being performed. A system full-scale calibration takes a time of one settling period to be performed.\n1001 to1111 Reserved.\nDATA REGISTER\nRS[5:0] = 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0\nPower-On/Reset = 0x000000\nThe conversion result from the ADC is stored in this data register.

MCLK_COUNT Register Bit Descriptions\nBits Bit Name Description\n7:0 MCLK_COUNT This register allows the user to determine the frequency of the internal/external oscillator. Internally, a clock counter increments every 131\npulses of the sampling clock (614.4 kHz in full power mode, 153.6 kHz in mid power mode, and 768 kHz in low power mode). The 8-bit counter\nwraps around on reaching its maximum value. The counter output is read back via this register.\nNote that the incrementation of the register is asynchronous to the register read. If a register read coincides with the register incrementation, it\nis possible to read an invalid value. To prevent this, read the register four times rather than once, then read the register four times again at a\nlater point. By reading four values, it is possible to identify the correct register value at the start and at the end of the timing instants.\nCHANNEL REGISTERS\nRS[5:0] = 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1 to 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0\nData Sheet AD7124-8\nON-CHIP REGISTERS\nanalog.com Rev. F | 89 of 95Power-On/Reset = 0x8001 for CHANNEL_0; all other channel registers are set to 0x0001\nSixteen channel registers are included on the AD7124-8 , CHANNEL_0 to CHANNEL_15. The channel registers begin at Address 0x09\n(CHANNEL_0) and end at Address 0x18 (CHANNEL_15). Via each register, the user can configure the channel (AINP input and AINM input),\nenable or disable the channel, and select the setup. The setup is selectable from eight different options defined by the user. When the ADC\nconverts, it automatically sequences through all enabled channels. This allows the user to sample some channels multiple times in a sequence,\nif required. In addition, it allows the user to include diagnostic functions in a sequence also.\nTable 74  outlines the bit designations for the register. Bit 15 is the first bit of the data stream.

Channel Register Bit Descriptions\nBits Bit Name Description\n15 Enable Channel enable bit. Setting this bit enables the device channel for the conversion sequence. By default, only the enable bit for Channel 0\nis set. The order of conversions starts with the lowest enabled channel, then cycles through successively higher channel numbers, before\nwrapping around to the lowest channel again.\nWhen the ADC writes a result for a particular channel, the four LSBs of the status register are set to the channel number, 0 to 15. This allows\nthe channel the data corresponds to be identified. When the DATA_STATUS bit in the ADC_CONTROL register is set, the contents of the\nstatus register are appended to each conversion when it is read. Use this function when several channels are enabled to determine to which\nchannel the conversion value read corresponds.\n14:12 Setup Setup select. These bits identify which of the eight setups are used to configure the ADC for this channel. A setup comprises a set of four\nregisters: analog configuration, output data rate/filter selection, offset register, and gain register. All channels can use the same setup, in\nwhich case the same 3-bit value must be written to these bits on all active channels. Alternatively, up to eight channels can be configured\ndifferently.\n11:10 0 These bits must be programmed with a Logic 0 for correct operation.\n9:5 AINP[4:0] Positive analog input AINP input select.
