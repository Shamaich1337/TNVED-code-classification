Digital\noutput data is formatted as 16-bit twos complement and is accessi-\nble through either a SPI (3- or 4-wire) or I2C digital interface.\nThe ADXL345  is well suited for mobile device applications. It meas-\nures the static acceleration of gravity in tilt-sensing applications, as\nwell as dynamic acceleration resulting from motion or shock. Its\nhigh resolution (3.9 m g/LSB) enables measurement of inclination\nchanges less than 1.0°.\nSeveral special sensing functions are provided. Activity and inactiv-\nity sensing detect the presence or lack of motion by comparing\nthe acceleration on any axis with user-set thresholds. Tap sensing\ndetects single and double taps in any direction. Free-fall sensing\ndetects if the device is falling. These functions can be mapped\nindividually to either of two interrupt output pins. An integrated\nmemory management system with a 32-level first in, first out (FIFO)\nbuffer can be used to store data to minimize host processor activity\nand lower overall system power consumption.\nLow power modes enable intelligent motion-based power manage-\nment with threshold sensing and active acceleration measurement\nat extremely low power dissipation.\nThe ADXL345  is supplied in a small, thin, 3 mm × 5 mm × 1 mm,\n14-lead, plastic package .\nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM\nFigure 1.\nData Sheet ADXL345\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

For 0 g offset and sensitivity, the deviation from the ideal describes the worst case of mean ±1 σ.\n2Cross-axis sensitivity is defined as coupling between any two axes.\n3Bandwidth is the −3 dB frequency and is half the output data rate, bandwidth = ODR/2.\n4The output format for the 3200 Hz and 1600 Hz ODRs is different than the output format for the remaining ODRs. This difference is described in the Data Formatting of\nUpper Data Rates  section.\n5Output data rates below 6.25 Hz exhibit additional offset shift with increased temperature, depending on selected output data rate. Refer to the Offset Performance at\nLowest Data Rates  section for details.\n6Self-test change is defined as the output ( g) when the SELF_TEST bit = 1 (in the DATA_FORMAT register, Address 0x31) minus the output ( g) when the SELF_TEST bit\n= 0. Due to device filtering, the output reaches its final value after 4 × τ when enabling or disabling self-test, where τ = 1/( data rate). The part must be in normal power\noperation (LOW_POWER bit = 0 in the BW_RATE register, Address 0x2C) for self-test to operate correctly.\n7Turn-on and wake-up times are determined by the user-defined bandwidth. At a 100 Hz data rate, the turn-on and wake-up times are each approximately 11.1 ms. For other\ndata rates, the turn-on and wake-up times are each approximately τ + 1.1 in milliseconds, where τ = 1/( data rate).\nData Sheet ADXL345\nABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nanalog.com Rev.

G | 12 of 36The ADXL345  is a complete 3-axis acceleration measurement\nsystem with a selectable measurement range of ±2 g, ±4 g, ±8 g, or\n±16 g. It measures both dynamic acceleration resulting from motion\nor shock and static acceleration, such as gravity, that allows the\ndevice to be used as a tilt sensor.\nThe sensor is a polysilicon surface-micromachined structure built\non top of a silicon wafer. Polysilicon springs suspend the structure\nover the surface of the wafer and provide a resistance against\nforces due to applied acceleration.\nDeflection of the structure is measured using differential capacitors\nthat consist of independent fixed plates and plates attached to the\nmoving mass. Acceleration deflects the proof mass and unbalances\nthe differential capacitor, resulting in a sensor output whose ampli-\ntude is proportional to acceleration. Phase-sensitive demodulation\nis used to determine the magnitude and polarity of the acceleration.\nPOWER SEQUENCING\nPower can be applied to VS or VDD I/O in any sequence without\ndamaging the ADXL345 . All possible power-on modes are summar-ized in Table 6 . The interface voltage level is set with the interface\nsupply voltage, VDD I/O, which must be present to ensure that the\nADXL345  does not create a conflict on the communication bus.\nFor single-supply operation, VDD I/O can be the same as the main\nsupply, VS. In a dual-supply application, however, VDD I/O can differ\nfrom VS to accommodate the desired interface voltage, as long\nas VS is greater than or equal to VDD I/O. When power cycling is\nrequired, VS and VDD I/O must be completely discharged (to GND)\nbefore powering the device back on.\nAfter VS is applied, the device enters standby mode, where power\nconsumption is minimized and the device waits for VDD I/O to be\napplied and for the command to enter measurement mode to be\nreceived. (This command can be initiated by setting the measure bit\n(Bit D3) in the POWER_CTL register (Address 0x2D).) In addition,\nwhile the device is in standby mode, any register can be written to\nor read from to configure the part. It is recommended to configure\nthe device in standby mode and then to enable measurement\nmode. Clearing the measure bit returns the device to the standby\nmode.\nTable 6. Power Sequencing\nCondition VS VDD I/O Description\nPower Off Off Off The device is completely off, but there is a potential for a communication bus conflict.\nBus Disabled On Off The device is on in standby mode, but communication is unavailable and creates a conflict on the communication bus.\nThe duration of this state should be minimized during power-up to prevent a conflict.\nBus Enabled Off On No functions are available, but the device does not create a conflict on the communication bus.\nStandby or Measurement On On At power-up, the device is in standby mode, awaiting a command to enter measurement mode, and all sensor functions\nare off. After the device is instructed to enter measurement mode, all sensor functions are available.\nData Sheet ADXL345\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. G | 13 of 36POWER SAVINGS\nPower Modes\nThe ADXL345  automatically modulates its power consumption in\nproportion to its output data rate, as outlined in Table 7 . If addition-\nal power savings is desired, a lower power mode is available.\nIn this mode, the internal sampling rate is reduced, allowing for\npower savings in the 12.5 Hz to 400 Hz data rate range at the\nexpense of slightly greater noise. To enter low power mode, set\nthe LOW_POWER bit (Bit 4) in the BW_RATE register (Address\n0x2C). Table 8  shows the current consumption in low power mode\nfor cases where there is an advantage to using low power mode.\nUse of low power mode for a data rate not shown in Table 8  does\nnot provide any advantage over the same data rate in normal power\nmode. Therefore, it is recommended that only data rates shown\nin Table 8  be used in low power mode. The current consumption\nvalues shown in Table 7  and Table 8  are for a VS of 2.5 V.\nTable 7.

To enable this\nfeature, set the THRESH_INACT register (Address 0x25) and the\nTIME_INACT register (Address 0x26) each to a value that signifies\ninactivity (the appropriate value depends on the application), and\nthen set the AUTO_SLEEP bit (Bit D4) and the link bit (Bit D5) in\nthe POWER_CTL register (Address 0x2D). Current consumption at\nthe sub-12.5 Hz data rates that are used in this mode is typically 23\nµA for a VS of 2.5 V.\nStandby Mode\nFor even lower power operation, standby mode can be used. In\nstandby mode, current consumption is reduced to 0.1 µA (typical).\nIn this mode, no measurements are made. Enter standby mode\nby clearing the measure bit (Bit D3) in the POWER_CTL register\n(Address 0x2D). Placing the device into standby mode preserves\nthe contents of FIFO.\nData Sheet ADXL345\nSERIAL COMMUNICATIONS\nanalog.com Rev. G | 14 of 36I2C and SPI digital communications are available. In both cases, the\nADXL345  operates as a slave. I2C mode is enabled if the CS pin is\ntied high to VDD I/O. The CS pin should always be tied high to VDD\nI/O or be driven by an external controller because there is no default\nmode if the CS pin is left unconnected. Therefore, not taking these\nprecautions may result in an inability to communicate with the part.\nIn SPI mode, the CS pin is controlled by the bus master. In both SPI\nand I2C modes of operation, data transmitted from the ADXL345  to\nthe master device should be ignored during writes to the ADXL345 .\nSPI\nFor SPI, either 3- or 4-wire configuration is possible, as shown\nin the connection diagrams in Figure 34  and Figure 35 . Clearing\nthe SPI bit (Bit D6) in the DATA_FORMAT register (Address 0x31)\nselects 4-wire mode, whereas setting the SPI bit selects 3-wire\nmode. The maximum SPI clock speed is 5 MHz with 100 pF\nmaximum loading, and the timing scheme follows clock polarity\n(CPOL) = 1 and clock phase (CPHA) = 1. If power is applied\nto the ADXL345  before the clock polarity and phase of the host\nprocessor are configured, the CS pin should be brought high before\nchanging the clock polarity and phase. When using 3-wire SPI, it\nis recommended that the SDO pin be either pulled up to VDD I/O or\npulled down to GND via a 10 k Ω resistor.\nFigure 34. 3-Wire SPI Connection Diagram\nFigure 35. 4-Wire SPI Connection Diagram\nCS is the serial port enable line and is controlled by the SPI master.\nThis line must go low at the start of a transmission and high at the\nend of a transmission, as shown in Figure 37 . SCLK is the serial\nport clock and is supplied by the SPI master. SCLK should idle high\nduring a period of no transmission. SDI and SDO are the serial data\ninput and output, respectively. Data is updated on the falling edge\nof SCLK and should be sampled on the rising edge of SCLK.\nTo read or write multiple bytes in a single transmission, the mul-\ntiple-byte bit, located after the R/ W bit in the first byte transfer(MB in Figure 37  to Figure 39 ), must be set. After the register\naddressing and the first byte of data, each subsequent set of clock\npulses (eight clock pulses) causes the ADXL345  to point to the next\nregister for a read or write. This shifting continues until the clock\npulses cease and CS is deasserted. To perform reads or writes on\ndifferent, nonsequential registers, CS must be deasserted between\ntransmissions and the new register must be addressed separately.\nThe timing diagram for 3-wire SPI reads or writes is shown in Fig-\nure 39 . The 4-wire equivalents for SPI writes and reads are shown\nin Figure 37  and Figure 38 , respectively. For correct operation of\nthe part, the logic thresholds and timing parameters in Table 9  and\nTable 10  must be met at all times.\nUse of the 3200 Hz and 1600 Hz output data rates is only recom-\nmended with SPI communication rates greater than or equal to\n2 MHz. The 800 Hz output data rate is recommended only for\ncommunication speeds greater than or equal to 400 kHz, and\nthe remaining data rates scale proportionally. For example, the\nminimum recommended communication speed for a 200 Hz output\ndata rate is 100 kHz. Operation at an output data rate above the\nrecommended maximum may result in undesirable effects on the\nacceleration data, including missing samples or additional noise.\nPreventing Bus Traffic Errors\nThe ADXL345  CS pin is used both for initiating SPI transactions,\nand for enabling I2C mode. When the ADXL345  is used on a SPI\nbus with multiple devices, its CS pin is held high while the master\ncommunicates with the other devices. There may be conditions\nwhere a SPI command transmitted to another device looks like a\nvalid I2C command. In this case, the ADXL345  would interpret this\nas an attempt to communicate in I2C mode, and could interfere with\nother bus traffic. Unless bus traffic can be adequately controlled to\nassure such a condition never occurs, it is recommended to add a\nlogic gate in front of the SDI pin as shown in Figure 36 . This OR\ngate will hold the SDA line high when CS is high to prevent SPI bus\ntraffic at the ADXL345  from appearing as an I2C start command.\nFigure 36.

G | 17 of 36I2C\nWith CS tied high to VDD I/O, the ADXL345  is in I2C mode, requiring\na simple 2-wire connection, as shown in Figure 40 . The ADXL345\nconforms to the UM10204 I2C-Bus Specification and User Manual ,\nRev. 03—19 June 2007, available from NXP Semiconductors. It\nsupports standard (100 kHz) and fast (400 kHz) data transfer\nmodes if the bus parameters given in Table 11  and Table 12\nare met. Single- or multiple-byte reads/writes are supported, as\nshown in Figure 41 . With the ALT ADDRESS pin high, the 7-bit\nI2C address for the device is 0x1D, followed by the R/ W bit. This\ntranslates to 0x3A for a write and 0x3B for a read. An alternate\nI2C address of 0x53 (followed by the R/ W bit) can be chosen by\ngrounding the SDO/ALT ADDRESS pin (Pin 12). This translates to\n0xA6 for a write and 0xA7 for a read.\nThere are no internal pull-up or pull-down resistors for any unused\npins; therefore, there is no known state or default state for the CS\nor ALT ADDRESS pin if left floating or unconnected. It is required\nthat the CS pin be connected to VDD I/O and that the ALT ADDRESS\npin be connected to either VDD I/O or GND when using I2C.\nDue to communication speed limitations, the maximum output data\nrate when using 400 kHz I2C is 800 Hz and scales linearly with achange in the I2C communication speed. For example, using I2C\nat 100 kHz would limit the maximum ODR to 200 Hz. Operation at\nan output data rate above the recommended maximum may result\nin undesirable effect on the acceleration data, including missing\nsamples or additional noise.\nFigure 40. I2C Connection Diagram (Address 0x53)\nIf other devices are connected to the same I2C bus, the nominal op-\nerating voltage level of these other devices cannot exceed VDD I/O\nby more than 0.3 V. External pull-up resistors, RP, are necessary for\nproper I2C operation. Refer to the UM10204 I2C-Bus Specification\nand User Manual , Rev. 03—19 June 2007, when selecting pull-up\nresistor values to ensure proper operation.\nTable 11.

This value is calculated as t6(max) = t3 −\nt10 − t5(min).\nFigure 42. I2C Timing Diagram\nData Sheet ADXL345\nINTERRUPTS\nanalog.com Rev. G | 19 of 36The ADXL345  provides two output pins for driving interrupts: INT1\nand INT2. Both interrupt pins are push-pull, low impedance pins\nwith output specifications shown in Table 13 . The default configura-\ntion of the interrupt pins is active high. This can be changed to\nactive low by setting the INT_INVERT bit in the DATA_FORMAT\n(Address 0x31) register. All functions can be used simultaneously,\nwith the only limiting feature being that some functions may need to\nshare interrupt pins.\nInterrupts are enabled by setting the appropriate bit in the INT_EN-\nABLE register (Address 0x2E) and are mapped to either the INT1\npin or the INT2 pin based on the contents of the INT_MAP register\n(Address 0x2F). When initially configuring the interrupt pins, it is\nrecommended that the functions and interrupt mapping be done be-\nfore enabling the interrupts. When changing the configuration of aninterrupt, it is recommended that the interrupt be disabled first, by\nclearing the bit corresponding to that function in the INT_ENABLE\nregister, and then the function be reconfigured before enabling the\ninterrupt again. Configuration of the functions while the interrupts\nare disabled helps to prevent the accidental generation of an\ninterrupt before desired.\nThe interrupt functions are latched and cleared by either reading\nthe data registers (Address 0x32 to Address 0x37) until the interrupt\ncondition is no longer valid for the data-related interrupts or by\nreading the INT_SOURCE register (Address 0x30) for the remain-\ning interrupts. This section describes the interrupts that can be set\nin the INT_ENABLE register and monitored in the INT_SOURCE\nregister.\nTable 13.

G | 20 of 36DATA_READY\nThe DATA_READY bit is set when new data is available and is\ncleared when no new data is available.\nSINGLE_TAP\nThe SINGLE_TAP bit is set when a single acceleration event that\nis greater than the value in the THRESH_TAP register (Address\n0x1D) occurs for less time than is specified in the DUR register\n(Address 0x21).\nDOUBLE_TAP\nThe DOUBLE_TAP bit is set when two acceleration events that\nare greater than the value in the THRESH_TAP register (Address\n0x1D) occur for less time than is specified in the DUR register\n(Address 0x21), with the second tap starting after the time specified\nby the latent register (Address 0x22) but within the time specified in\nthe window register (Address 0x23). See the Tap Detection  section\nfor more details.\nACTIVITY\nThe activity bit is set when acceleration greater than the value\nstored in the THRESH_ACT register (Address 0x24) is experienced\non any participating axis, set by the ACT_INACT_CTL register\n(Address 0x27).\nINACTIVITY\nThe inactivity bit is set when acceleration of less than the val-\nue stored in the THRESH_INACT register (Address 0x25) is ex-perienced for more time than is specified in the TIME_INACT\nregister (Address 0x26) on all participating axes, as set by the\nACT_INACT_CTL register (Address 0x27). The maximum value for\nTIME_INACT is 255 sec.\nFREE_FALL\nThe FREE_FALL bit is set when acceleration of less than the value\nstored in the THRESH_FF register (Address 0x28) is experienced\nfor more time than is specified in the TIME_FF register (Address\n0x29) on all axes (logical AND). The FREE_FALL interrupt differs\nfrom the inactivity interrupt as follows: all axes always participate\nand are logically AND’ed, the timer period is much smaller (1.28\nsec maximum), and the mode of operation is always dc-coupled.\nWATERMARK\nThe watermark bit is set when the number of samples in FIFO\nequals the value stored in the samples bits (Register FIFO_CTL,\nAddress 0x38). The watermark bit is cleared automatically when\nFIFO is read, and the content returns to a value below the value\nstored in the samples bits.\nOVERRUN\nThe overrun bit is set when new data replaces unread data. The\nprecise operation of the overrun function depends on the FIFO\nmode. In bypass mode, the overrun bit is set when new data\nreplaces unread data in the DATAX, DATAY, and DATAZ registers\n(Address 0x32 to Address 0x37). In all other modes, the overrun bit\nis set when FIFO is filled. The overrun bit is automatically cleared\nwhen the contents of FIFO are read.\nData Sheet ADXL345\nFIFO\nanalog.com Rev. G | 21 of 36The ADXL345  contains technology for an embedded memory man-\nagement system with 32-level FIFO that can be used to minimize\nhost processor burden. This buffer has four modes: bypass, FIFO,\nstream, and trigger (see Table 37 ). Each mode is selected by the\nsettings of the FIFO_MODE bits (Bits[D7:D6]) in the FIFO_CTL\nregister (Address 0x38).\nBYPASS MODE\nIn bypass mode, FIFO is not operational and, therefore, re-\nmains empty.\nFIFO MODE\nIn FIFO mode, data from measurements of the x-, y-, and z-axes\nare stored in FIFO. When the number of samples in FIFO equals\nthe level specified in the samples bits of the FIFO_CTL register\n(Address 0x38), the watermark interrupt is set. FIFO continues ac-\ncumulating samples until it is full (32 samples from measurements\nof the x-, y-, and z-axes) and then stops collecting data. After FIFO\nstops collecting data, the device continues to operate; therefore,\nfeatures such as tap detection can be used after FIFO is full. The\nwatermark interrupt continues to occur until the number of samples\nin FIFO is less than the value stored in the samples bits of the\nFIFO_CTL register.\nSTREAM MODE\nIn stream mode, data from measurements of the x-, y-, and z-axes\nare stored in FIFO. When the number of samples in FIFO equals\nthe level specified in the samples bits of the FIFO_CTL register\n(Address 0x38), the watermark interrupt is set. FIFO continues\naccumulating samples and holds the latest 32 samples from meas-\nurements of the x-, y-, and z-axes, discarding older data as new\ndata arrives. The watermark interrupt continues occurring until the\nnumber of samples in FIFO is less than the value stored in the\nsamples bits of the FIFO_CTL register.\nTRIGGER MODE\nIn trigger mode, FIFO accumulates samples, holding the latest 32\nsamples from measurements of the x-, y-, and z-axes. After a\ntrigger event occurs and an interrupt is sent to the INT1 or INT2\npin (determined by the trigger bit in the FIFO_CTL register), FIFO\nkeeps the last n samples (where n is the value specified by the\nsamples bits in the FIFO_CTL register) and then operates in FIFO\nmode, collecting new samples only when FIFO is not full. A delay of\nat least 5 µs should be present between the trigger event occurring\nand the start of reading data from the FIFO to allow the FIFO to\ndiscard and retain the necessary samples. Additional trigger events\ncannot be recognized until the trigger mode is reset. To reset the\ntrigger mode, set the device to bypass mode and then set the\ndevice back to trigger mode. Note that the FIFO data should be\nread first because placing the device into bypass mode clears\nFIFO.RETRIEVING DATA FROM FIFO\nThe FIFO data is read through the DATAX, DATAY, and DATAZ\nregisters (Address 0x32 to Address 0x37). When the FIFO is in\nFIFO, stream, or trigger mode, reads to the DATAX, DATAY, and\nDATAZ registers read data stored in the FIFO. Each time data is\nread from the FIFO, the oldest x-, y-, and z-axes data are placed\ninto the DATAX, DATAY, and DATAZ registers.\nIf a single-byte read operation is performed, the remaining bytes of\ndata for the current FIFO sample are lost. Therefore, all axes of\ninterest should be read in a burst (or multiple-byte) read operation.\nTo ensure that the FIFO has completely popped (that is, that new\ndata has completely moved into the DATAX, DATAY, and DATAZ\nregisters), there must be at least 5 µs between the end of reading\nthe data registers and the start of a new read of the FIFO or a read\nof the FIFO_STATUS register (Address 0x39). The end of reading\na data register is signified by the transition from Register 0x37 to\nRegister 0x38 or by the CS pin going high.\nFor SPI operation at 1.6 MHz or less, the register addressing\nportion of the transmission is a sufficient delay to ensure that the\nFIFO has completely popped. For SPI operation greater than 1.6\nMHz, it is necessary to deassert the CS pin to ensure a total\ndelay of 5 µs; otherwise, the delay is not sufficient. The total delay\nnecessary for 5 MHz operation is at most 3.4 µs. This is not a\nconcern when using I2C mode because the communication rate is\nlow enough to ensure a sufficient delay between FIFO reads.\nData Sheet ADXL345\nSELF-TEST\nanalog.com Rev. G | 22 of 36The ADXL345  incorporates a self-test feature that effectively tests\nits mechanical and electronic systems simultaneously. When the\nself-test function is enabled (via the SELF_TEST bit in the DA-\nTA_FORMAT register, Address 0x31), an electrostatic force is exert-\ned on the mechanical sensor. This electrostatic force moves the\nmechanical sensing element in the same manner as acceleration,\nand it is additive to the acceleration experienced by the device. This\nadded electrostatic force results in an output change in the x-, y-,\nand z-axes. Because the electrostatic force is proportional to VS2,\nthe output change varies with VS. This effect is shown in Figure\n43. The scale factors shown in Table 14  can be used to adjust the\nexpected self-test output limits for different supply voltages, VS. The\nself-test feature of the ADXL345  also exhibits a bimodal behavior.\nHowever, the limits shown in Table 1  and Table 15  to Table 18\nare valid for both potential self-test values due to bimodality. Use\nof the self-test feature at data rates less than 100 Hz or at 1600\nHz may yield values outside these limits. Therefore, the part must\nbe in normal power operation (LOW_POWER bit = 0 in BW_RATE\nregister, Address 0x2C) and be placed into a data rate of 100 Hz\nthrough 800 Hz or 3200 Hz for the self-test function to operate\ncorrectly.\nFigure 43.

The data format is unsigned, therefore,\nthe magnitude of the tap event is compared with the value\nin THRESH_TAP for normal tap detection. The scale factor is\n62.5 m g/LSB (that is, 0xFF = 16 g). A value of 0 may result in\nundesirable behavior if single tap/double tap interrupts are enabled.\nRegister 0x1E, Register 0x1F, Register 0x20—\nOFSX, OFSY, OFSZ (Read/Write)\nThe OFSX, OFSY, and OFSZ registers are each eight bits and offer\nuser-set offset adjustments in twos complement format with a scale\nfactor of 15.6 m g/LSB (that is, 0x7F = 2 g). The value stored in\nthe offset registers is automatically added to the acceleration data,\nand the resulting value is stored in the output data registers. For\nadditional information regarding offset calibration and the use of the\noffset registers, refer to the Offset Calibration  section.\nRegister 0x21—DUR (Read/Write)\nThe DUR register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time value\nrepresenting the maximum time that an event must be above the\nTHRESH_TAP threshold to qualify as a tap event. The scale factor\nis 625 µs/LSB. A value of 0 disables the single tap/ double tap\nfunctions.\nRegister 0x22—Latent (Read/Write)\nThe latent register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time value\nrepresenting the wait time from the detection of a tap event to the\nstart of the time window (defined by the window register) during\nwhich a possible second tap event can be detected. The scale\nfactor is 1.25 ms/LSB. A value of 0 disables the double tap function.\nRegister 0x23—Window (Read/Write)\nThe window register is eight bits and contains an unsigned time\nvalue representing the amount of time after the expiration of the\nlatency time (determined by the latent register) during which a\nsecond valid tap can begin.

A\nvalue of 0 disables the double tap function.Register 0x24—THRESH_ACT (Read/Write)\nThe THRESH_ACT register is eight bits and holds the threshold\nvalue for detecting activity. The data format is unsigned, so the\nmagnitude of the activity event is compared with the value in the\nTHRESH_ACT register. The scale factor is 62.5 m g/LSB. A value\nof 0 may result in undesirable behavior if the activity interrupt is\nenabled.\nRegister 0x25—THRESH_INACT (Read/Write)\nThe THRESH_INACT register is eight bits and holds the threshold\nvalue for detecting inactivity. The data format is unsigned, so the\nmagnitude of the inactivity event is compared with the value in the\nTHRESH_INACT register. The scale factor is 62.5 m g/LSB. A value\nof 0 may result in undesirable behavior if the inactivity interrupt is\nenabled.\nRegister 0x26—TIME_INACT (Read/Write)\nThe TIME_INACT register is eight bits and contains an unsigned\ntime value representing the amount of time that acceleration must\nbe less than the value in the THRESH_INACT register for inactivity\nto be declared. The scale factor is 1 sec/LSB. Unlike the other\ninterrupt functions, which use unfiltered data (see the Threshold\nsection), the inactivity function uses filtered output data.

If additional decoupling is necessary,\na resistor or ferrite bead, no larger than 100 Ω, in series with VS\nmay be helpful. Additionally, increasing the bypass capacitance on\nVS to a 10 µF tantalum capacitor in parallel with a 0.1 µF ceramic\ncapacitor may also improve noise.\nCare should be taken to ensure that the connection from the\nADXL345  ground to the power supply ground has low impedance\nbecause noise transmitted through ground has an effect similar to\nnoise transmitted through VS. It is recommended that VS and VDD\nI/O be separate supplies to minimize digital clocking noise on the VS\nsupply. If this is not possible, additional filtering of the supplies, as\npreviously mentioned, may be necessary.\nFigure 44. Application Diagram\nMECHANICAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR\nMOUNTING\nThe ADXL345  should be mounted on the PCB in a location close\nto a hard mounting point of the PCB to the case. Mounting the\nADXL345  at an unsupported PCB location, as shown in Figure 45 ,\nmay result in large, apparent measurement errors due to undamp-\nened PCB vibration. Locating the accelerometer near a hard mount-\ning point ensures that any PCB vibration at the accelerometer is\nabove the accelerometer’s mechanical sensor resonant frequency\nand, therefore, effectively invisible to the accelerometer. Multiple\nmounting points, close to the sensor, and/or a thicker PCB also help\nto reduce the effect of system resonance on the performance of the\nsensor.\nFigure 45. Incorrectly Placed Accelerometers\nTAP DETECTION\nThe tap interrupt function is capable of detecting either single or\ndouble taps. The following parameters are shown in Figure 46  for a\nvalid single and valid double tap event:►The tap detection threshold is defined by the THRESH_TAP\nregister (Address 0x1D).\n►The maximum tap duration time is defined by the DUR register\n(Address 0x21).\n►The tap latency time is defined by the latent register (Address\n0x22) and is the waiting period from the end of the first tap until\nthe start of the time window, when a second tap can be detected,\nwhich is determined by the value in the window register (Address\n0x23).\n►The interval after the latency time (set by the latent register)\nis defined by the window register. Although a second tap must\nbegin after the latency time has expired, it need not finish before\nthe end of the time defined by the window register.\nFigure 46. Tap Interrupt Function with Valid Single and Double Taps\nIf only the single tap function is in use, the single tap interrupt is\ntriggered when the acceleration goes below the threshold, as long\nas DUR has not been exceeded. If both single and double tap\nfunctions are in use, the single tap interrupt is triggered when the\ndouble tap event has been either validated or invalidated.\nSeveral events can occur to invalidate the second tap of a double\ntap event. First, if the suppress bit in the TAP_AXES register\n(Address 0x2A) is set, any acceleration spike above the threshold\nduring the latency time (set by the latent register) invalidates the\ndouble tap detection, as shown in Figure 47 .\nFigure 47. Double Tap Event Invalid Due to High g Event When the Suppress\nBit Is Set\nA double tap event can also be invalidated if acceleration above the\nthreshold is detected at the start of the time window for the second\ntap (set by the window register). This results in an invalid double\ntap at the start of this window, as shown in Figure 48 . Additionally, a\ndouble tap event can be invalidated if an acceleration exceeds the\ntime limit for taps (set by the DUR register), resulting in an invalid\nData Sheet ADXL345\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. G | 30 of 36double tap at the end of the DUR time limit for the second tap\nevent, also shown in Figure 48 .\nFigure 48. Tap Interrupt Function with Invalid Double Taps\nSingle taps, double taps, or both can be detected by setting\nthe respective bits in the INT_ENABLE register (Address 0x2E).\nControl over participation of each of the three axes in single tap/\ndouble tap detection is exerted by setting the appropriate bits in\nthe TAP_AXES register (Address 0x2A). For the double tap function\nto operate, both the latent and window registers must be set to a\nnonzero value.\nEvery mechanical system has somewhat different single tap/ double\ntap responses based on the mechanical characteristics of the\nsystem. Therefore, some experimentation with values for the DUR,\nlatent, window, and THRESH_TAP registers is required. In general,\na good starting point is to set the DUR register to a value greater\nthan 0x10 (10 ms), the latent register to a value greater than\n0x10 (20 ms), the window register to a value greater than 0x40\n(80 ms), and the THRESH_TAP register to a value greater than\n0x30 (3 g). Setting a very low value in the latent, window, or\nTHRESH_TAP register may result in an unpredictable response\ndue to the accelerometer picking up echoes of the tap inputs.\nAfter a tap interrupt has been received, the first axis to exceed the\nTHRESH_TAP level is reported in the ACT_TAP_STATUS register\n(Address 0x2B). This register is never cleared but is overwritten\nwith new data.\nTHRESHOLD\nThe lower output data rates are achieved by decimating a common\nsampling frequency inside the device. The activity, free-fall, and sin-\ngle tap/double tap detection functions without improved tap enabled\nare performed using undecimated data. Because the bandwidth\nof the output data varies with the data rate and is lower than\nthe bandwidth of the undecimated data, the high frequency and\nhigh g data that is used to determine activity, free-fall, and single\ntap/double tap events may not be present if the output of theaccelerometer is examined. This may result in functions triggering\nwhen acceleration data does not appear to meet the conditions set\nby the user for the corresponding function.\nLINK MODE\nThe function of the link bit is to reduce the number of activity\ninterrupts that the processor must service by setting the device to\nlook for activity only after inactivity. For proper operation of this\nfeature, the processor must still respond to the activity and inactivity\ninterrupts by reading the INT_SOURCE register (Address 0x30)\nand, therefore, clearing the interrupts. If an activity interrupt is not\ncleared, the part cannot go into autosleep mode. The asleep bit in\nthe ACT_TAP_STATUS register (Address 0x2B) indicates if the part\nis asleep.\nSLEEP MODE VS. LOW POWER MODE\nIn applications where a low data rate and low power consumption is\ndesired (at the expense of noise performance), it is recommended\nthat low power mode be used. The use of low power mode pre-\nserves the functionality of the DATA_READY interrupt and the FIFO\nfor postprocessing of the acceleration data. Sleep mode, while\noffering a low data rate and power consumption, is not intended for\ndata acquisition.\nHowever, when sleep mode is used in conjunction with the AU-\nTO_SLEEP mode and the link mode, the part can automatically\nswitch to a low power, low sampling rate mode when inactivity\nis detected. To prevent the generation of redundant inactivity inter-\nrupts, the inactivity interrupt is automatically disabled and activity is\nenabled. When the ADXL345  is in sleep mode, the host processor\ncan also be placed into sleep mode or low power mode to save\nsignificant system power. When activity is detected, the accelerom-\neter automatically switches back to the original data rate of the\napplication and provides an activity interrupt that can be used to\nwake up the host processor. Similar to when inactivity occurs,\ndetection of activity events is disabled and inactivity is enabled.\nOFFSET CALIBRATION\nAccelerometers are mechanical structures containing elements that\nare free to move. These moving parts can be very sensitive to\nmechanical stresses, much more so than solid-state electronics.\nThe 0 g bias or offset is an important accelerometer metric be-\ncause it defines the baseline for measuring acceleration. Additional\nstresses can be applied during assembly of a system containing\nan accelerometer. These stresses can come from, but are not\nlimited to, component soldering, board stress during mounting, and\napplication of any compounds on or over the component. If calibra-\ntion is deemed necessary, it is recommended that calibration be\nperformed after system assembly to compensate for these effects.\nA simple method of calibration is to measure the offset while\nassuming that the sensitivity of the ADXL345  is as specified in\nTable 1 . The offset can then be automatically accounted for by\nData Sheet ADXL345\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. G | 31 of 36using the built-in offset registers. This results in the data acquired\nfrom the DATA registers already compensating for any offset.\nIn a no-turn or single-point calibration scheme, the part is oriented\nsuch that one axis, typically the z-axis, is in the 1 g field of gravity\nand the remaining axes, typically the x- and y-axis, are in a 0\ng field. The output is then measured by taking the average of a\nseries of samples. The number of samples averaged is a choice of\nthe system designer, but a recommended starting point is 0.1 sec\nworth of data for data rates of 100 Hz or greater. This corresponds\nto 10 samples at the 100 Hz data rate. For data rates less than\n100 Hz, it is recommended that at least 10 samples be averaged\ntogether. These values are stored as X0g, Y0g, and Z+1g for the 0 g\nmeasurements on the x- and y-axis and the 1 g measurement on\nthe z-axis, respectively.\nThe values measured for X0g and Y0g correspond to the x- and\ny-axis offset, and compensation is done by subtracting those values\nfrom the output of the accelerometer to obtain the actual accelera-\ntion:\n     XACTUAL  = XMEAS − X0g\n     YACTUAL  = YMEAS − Y0g\nBecause the z-axis measurement was done in a +1 g field, a no-\nturn or single-point calibration scheme assumes an ideal sensitivity,\nSZ for the z-axis. This is subtracted from Z+1g to attain the z-axis\noffset, which is then subtracted from future measured values to\nobtain the actual value:\n     Z0g = Z+1g − SZ\n     ZACTUAL  = ZMEAS − Z0g\nThe ADXL345  can automatically compensate the output for offset\nby using the offset registers (Register 0x1E, Register 0x1F, and\nRegister 0x20). These registers contain an 8-bit, twos complement\nvalue that is automatically added to all measured acceleration val-\nues, and the result is then placed into the DATA registers. Because\nthe value placed in an offset register is additive, a negative value is\nplaced into the register to eliminate a positive offset and vice versa\nfor a negative offset. The register has a scale factor of 15.6 m g/LSB\nand is independent of the selected g-range.\nAs an example, assume that the ADXL345  is placed into full-reso-\nlution mode with a sensitivity of typically 256 LSB/ g. The part is\noriented such that the z-axis is in the field of gravity and x-, y-, and\nz-axis outputs are measured as +10 LSB, −13 LSB, and +9 LSB,\nrespectively. Using the previous equations, X0g is +10 LSB, Y0g is\n−13 LSB, and Z0g is +9 LSB. Each LSB of output in full-resolution is\n3.9 m g or one-quarter of an LSB of the offset register. Because the\noffset register is additive, the 0 g values are negated and rounded\nto the nearest LSB of the offset register:\n     XOFFSET  = −Round(10/4) = −3 LSB\n     YOFFSET  = −Round( −13/4) = 3 LSB\n     ZOFFSET  = −Round(9/4) = −2 LSBThese values are programmed into the OFSX, OFSY, and OFXZ\nregisters, respectively, as 0xFD, 0x03 and 0xFE. As with all regis-\nters in the ADXL345 , the offset registers do not retain the value\nwritten into them when power is removed from the part. Power-cy-\ncling the ADXL345  returns the offset registers to their default value\nof 0x00.\nBecause the no-turn or single-point calibration method assumes an\nideal sensitivity in the z-axis, any error in the sensitivity results in\noffset error. For instance, if the actual sensitivity was 250 LSB/ g in\nthe previous example, the offset would be 15 LSB, not 9 LSB. To\nhelp minimize this error, an additional measurement point can be\nused with the z-axis in a 0 g field and the 0 g measurement can be\nused in the ZACTUAL  equation.\nUSING SELF-TEST\nThe self-test change is defined as the difference between the accel-\neration output of an axis with self-test enabled and the acceleration\noutput of the same axis with self-test disabled (see Endnote 6 of\nTable 1 ). This definition assumes that the sensor does not move\nbetween these two measurements, because if the sensor moves, a\nnon–self-test related shift corrupts the test.\nProper configuration of the ADXL345  is also necessary for an\naccurate self-test measurement. The part should be set with a\ndata rate of 100 Hz through 800 Hz, or 3200 Hz. This is done\nby ensuring that a value of 0x0A through 0x0D, or 0x0F is written\ninto the rate bits (Bit D3 through Bit D0) in the BW_RATE register\n(Address 0x2C). The part also must be placed into normal power\noperation by ensuring the LOW_POWER bit in the BW_RATE\nregister is cleared (LOW_POWER bit = 0) for accurate self-test\nmeasurements. It is recommended that the part be set to full-reso-\nlution, 16 g mode to ensure that there is sufficient dynamic range\nfor the entire self-test shift. This is done by setting Bit D3 of the\nDATA_FORMAT register (Address 0x31) and writing a value of\n0x03 to the range bits (Bit D1 and Bit D0) of the DATA_FORMAT\nregister (Address 0x31). This results in a high dynamic range for\nmeasurement and a 3.9 m g/LSB scale factor.\nAfter the part is configured for accurate self-test measurement,\nseveral samples of x-, y-, and z-axis acceleration data should\nbe retrieved from the sensor and averaged together. The number\nof samples averaged is a choice of the system designer, but a\nrecommended starting point is 0.1 sec worth of data for data rates\nof 100 Hz or greater. This corresponds to 10 samples at the 100 Hz\ndata rate. For data rates less than 100 Hz, it is recommended that\nat least 10 samples be averaged together. The averaged values\nshould be stored and labeled appropriately as the self-test disabled\ndata, that is, XST_OFF , YST_OFF , and ZST_OFF .\nNext, self-test should be enabled by setting Bit D7 (SELF_TEST)\nof the DATA_FORMAT register (Address 0x31). The output needs\nsome time (about four samples) to settle after enabling self-test.\nAfter allowing the output to settle, several samples of the x-, y-, and\nz-axis acceleration data should be taken again and averaged. It is\nrecommended that the same number of samples be taken for this\nData Sheet ADXL345\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. G | 32 of 36average as was previously taken. These averaged values should\nagain be stored and labeled appropriately as the value with self-test\nenabled, that is, XST_ON , YST_ON , and ZST_ON . Self-test can then be\ndisabled by clearing Bit D7 (SELF_TEST) of the DATA_FORMAT\nregister (Address 0x31).\nWith the stored values for self-test enabled and disabled, the\nself-test change is as follows:\n     XST = XST_ON  − XST_OFF\n     YST = YST_ON  − YST_OFF\n     ZST = ZST_ON  − ZST_OFF\nBecause the measured output for each axis is expressed in LSBs,\nXST, YST, and ZST are also expressed in LSBs. These values can\nbe converted to g’s of acceleration by multiplying each value by\nthe 3.9 m g/LSB scale factor, if configured for full-resolution mode.\nAdditionally, Table 15  through Table 18  correspond to the self-test\nrange converted to LSBs and can be compared with the measured\nself-test change when operating at a VS of 2.5 V. For other voltag-\nes, the minimum and maximum self-test output values should be\nadjusted based on (multiplied by) the scale factors shown in Table\n14. If the part was placed into ±2 g, 10-bit or full-resolution mode,\nthe values listed in Table 15  should be used. Although the fixed\n10-bit mode or a range other than 16 g can be used, a different\nset of values, as indicated in Table 16  through Table 18 , would\nneed to be used. Using a range below 8 g may result in insufficient\ndynamic range and should be considered when selecting the range\nof operation for measuring self-test.\nIf the self-test change is within the valid range, the test is consid-\nered successful. Generally, a part is considered to pass if the\nminimum magnitude of change is achieved. However, a part that\nchanges by more than the maximum magnitude is not necessarily a\nfailure.\nAnother effective method for using the self-test to verify accelerom-\neter functionality is to toggle the self test at a certain rate and then\nperform an FFT on the output. The FFT should have a correspond-ing tone at the frequency the self-test was toggled. Using an FFT\nlike this removes the dependency of the test on supply voltage and\non self-test magnitude, which can vary within a rather wide range.\nASYNCHRONOUS DATA READINGS\nAsynchronous readings of acceleration data can lead to access-\ning the acceleration data registers while they are being updated.\nTo avoid this, it is recommended to either enable stream mode\n(see Table 37 ) or to synchronize the SPI/I2C transaction to the\nDATA_READY interrupt functionality, so that the host processor\nsamples immediately after the DATA_READY interrupt goes high.\nDATA FORMATTING OF UPPER DATA RATES\nFormatting of output data at the 3200 Hz and 1600 Hz output data\nrates changes depending on the mode of operation (full-resolution\nor fixed 10-bit) and the selected output range.\nWhen using the 3200 Hz or 1600 Hz output data rates in full-reso-\nlution or ±2 g, 10-bit operation, the LSB of the output data-word\nis always 0. When data is right justified, this corresponds to Bit\nD0 of the DATAx0 register, as shown in Figure 49 . When data is\nleft justified and the part is operating in ±2 g, 10-bit mode, the\nLSB of the output data-word is Bit D6 of the DATAx0 register. In\nfull-resolution operation when data is left justified, the location of the\nLSB changes according to the selected output range.\nFor a range of ±2 g, the LSB is Bit D6 of the DATAx0 register; for\n±4 g, Bit D5 of the DATAx0 register; for ±8 g, Bit D4 of the DATAx0\nregister; and for ±16 g, Bit D3 of the DATAx0 register. This is shown\nin Figure 50 .\nThe use of 3200 Hz and 1600 Hz output data rates for fixed 10 ‑bit\noperation in the ±4 g, ±8 g, and ±16 g output ranges provides\nan LSB that is valid and that changes according to the applied\nacceleration. Therefore, in these modes of operation, Bit D0 is not\nalways 0 when output data is right justified and Bit D6 is not always\n0 when output data is left justified. Operation at any data rate of 800\nHz or lower also provides a valid LSB in all ranges and modes that\nchanges according to the applied acceleration.\nFigure 49.

Data Formatting of Full-Resolution and ±2 g, 10-Bit Modes of Operation When Output Data Is Left Justified\nNOISE PERFORMANCE\nThe specification of noise shown in Table 1  corresponds to the typi-\ncal noise performance of the ADXL345  in normal power operation\nwith an output data rate of 100 Hz (LOW_POWER bit (D4) = 0, rate\nbits (D3:D0) = 0xA in the BW_RATE register, Address 0x2C). For\nnormal power operation at data rates below 100 Hz, the noise of\nthe ADXL345  is equivalent to the noise at 100 Hz ODR in LSBs.\nFor data rates greater than 100 Hz, the noise increases roughly by\na factor of √2 per doubling of the data rate. For example, at 400 Hz\nODR, the noise on the x- and y-axes is typically less than 1.5 LSB\nrms, and the noise on the z-axis is typically less than 2.2 LSB rms.\nFor low power operation (LOW_POWER bit (D4) = 1 in the\nBW_RATE register, Address 0x2C), the noise of the ADXL345  is\nconstant for all valid data rates shown in Table 8 . This value is\ntypically less than 1.8 LSB rms for the x- and y-axes and typically\nless than 2.6 LSB rms for the z-axis.\nThe trend of noise performance for both normal power and low\npower modes of operation of the ADXL345  is shown in Figure 51 .\nFigure 52  shows the typical Allan deviation for the ADXL345 . The\n1/f corner of the device, as shown in this figure, is very low, allowing\nabsolute resolution of approximately 100 µg (assuming that there\nis sufficient integration time). Figure 52  also shows that the noise\ndensity is 290 µg/ √Hz for the x-axis and y-axis and 430 µg/ √Hz for\nthe z-axis.\nFigure 53  shows the typical noise performance trend of the\nADXL345  over supply voltage. The performance is normalized to\nthe tested and specified supply voltage, VS = 2.5 V. In general,\nnoise decreases as supply voltage is increased. It should be noted,\nas shown in Figure 51 , that the noise on the z-axis is typically\nhigher than on the x-axis and y-axis; therefore, while they change\nroughly the same in percentage over supply voltage, the magnitude\nof change on the z-axis is greater than the magnitude of change on\nthe x-axis and y-axis.Figure 51. Noise vs. Output Data Rate for Normal and Low Power Modes,\nFull-Resolution (256 LSB/g)\nFigure 52. Root Allan Deviation\nFigure 53. Normalized Noise vs. Supply Voltage, VS\nData Sheet ADXL345\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. G | 34 of 36OPERATION AT VOLTAGES OTHER THAN 2.5 V\nThe ADXL345  is tested and specified at a supply voltage of\nVS = 2.5 V; however, it can be powered with VS as high as 3.6\nV or as low as 2.0 V. Some performance parameters change as\nthe supply voltage changes: offset, sensitivity, noise, self-test, and\nsupply current.\nDue to slight changes in the electrostatic forces as supply voltage is\nvaried, the offset and sensitivity change slightly. When operating at\na supply voltage of VS = 3.3 V, the x- and y-axis offset is typically\n25 mg higher than at Vs = 2.5 V operation. The z-axis is typically\n20 mg lower when operating at a supply voltage of 3.3 V than when\noperating at VS = 2.5 V. Sensitivity on the x- and y-axes typically\nshifts from a nominal 256 LSB/ g (full-resolution or ±2 g, 10-bit\noperation) at VS = 2.5 V operation to 265 LSB/ g when operating\nwith a supply voltage of 3.3 V. The z-axis sensitivity is unaffected by\na change in supply voltage and is the same at VS = 3.3 V operation\nas it is at VS = 2.5 V operation. Simple linear interpolation can be\nused to determine typical shifts in offset and sensitivity at other\nsupply voltages.\nChanges in noise performance, self-test response, and supply\ncurrent are discussed elsewhere throughout the data sheet. For\nnoise performance, the Noise Performance  section should be re-\nviewed. The Using Self-Test  section discusses both the operation\nof self-test over voltage, a square relationship with supply voltage,\nas well as the conversion of the self-test response in g’s to LSBs.\nFinally, Figure 33  shows the impact of supply voltage on typical\ncurrent consumption at a 100 Hz output data rate, with all other\noutput data rates following the same trend.\nOFFSET PERFORMANCE AT LOWEST DATA\nRATES\nThe ADXL345  offers a large number of output data rates and\nbandwidths, designed for a large range of applications. However, at\nthe lowest data rates, described as those data rates below 6.25 Hz,\nthe offset performance over temperature can vary significantly from\nthe remaining data rates. Figure 54 , Figure 55 , and Figure 56  show\nthe typical offset performance of the ADXL345  over temperature for\nthe data rates of 6.25 Hz and lower. All plots are normalized to\nthe offset at 100 Hz output data rate; therefore, a nonzero value\ncorresponds to additional offset shift due to temperature for that\ndata rate.\nWhen using the lowest data rates, it is recommended that the\noperating temperature range of the device be limited to provideminimal offset shift across the operating temperature range. Due\nto variability between parts, it is also recommended that calibration\nover temperature be performed if any data rates below 6.25 Hz are\nin use.\nFigure 54.
