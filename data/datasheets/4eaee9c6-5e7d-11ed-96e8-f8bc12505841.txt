These amplifiers exhibit a high slew \nrate of 10V/μs and a gain-bandwidth product (GBWP) of \n10MHz. The MAX4230–MAX4234 can drive typical headset \nlevels (32Ω), as well as bias an RF power amplifier (PA) \nin wireless handset applications. \nThe MAX4230 comes in a tiny 5-pin SC70 package \nand the MAX4231, single with shutdown, is offered in \na 6-pin SC70 package and in 1.5mm x 1.0mm UCSP \nand thin μDFN packages. The dual op-amp MAX4233 is \noffered in the space-saving 10-bump chip-scale package \n(UCSP™), providing the smallest footprint area for a dual \nop amp with shutdown.\nThese op amps are designed to be part of the PA control  \ncircuitry, biasing RF PAs in wireless headsets. The MAX4231/\nMAX4233 offer a SHDN feature that drives the output low. \nThis ensures that the RF PA is fully disabled when needed, \npreventing unconverted signals to the RF antenna.\nApplications\n ●RF PA Biasing Controls in Handset Applications\n ●Portable/Battery-Powered Audio Applications\n ●Portable Headphone Speaker Drivers (32Ω)\n ●Audio Hands-Free Car Phones (Kits)\n ●Tablet/Notebook Computers\n ●Digital-to-Analog Converter Buffers\n ●Transformer/Line Drivers\n ●Motor DriversBenefits and Features\n ●Optimized for Headsets and High-Current Outputs\n• 200mA Output Drive Capability\n• 100dB Voltage Gain (R L = 100kΩ)\n• 85dB Power-Supply Rejection Ratio\n• No Phase Reversal for Overdriven Inputs\n• Unity-Gain Stable for Capacitive Loads to 780pF\n ●Suitable for High-Bandwidth Applications\n• 10MHz Gain-Bandwidth Product\n• High Slew Rate: 10V/μs\n ●Extends the Battery Life of Portable Applications\n• 1.1mA Supply Current per Amplifier\n ●Low-Power Shutdown Mode Reduces Supply Current \nto < 1μA\n ●Small Package Options\n• Tiny, 2.1mm x 2.0mm Space-Saving SC70 Package\n ●AEC-Q100 Qualified, See the Ordering Information \nfor the List of /V Parts\nSelector Guide  appears at end of data sheet.\nPin/Bump Configurations appear at end of data sheet.\nVisit www.maximintegrated.com/en/aboutus/legal/patents.\nhtml for product patent marking information.\nUCSP is a trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.\n19-2164; Rev 23; 5/21Ordering Information continued at end of data sheet.+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\nT = Tape and reel.PARTTEMP  \nRANGEPIN-\nPACKAGETOP \nMARK\nMAX4230 AXK+T -40°C to +125°C 5 SC70 ACS\nMAX4230AUK+T -40°C to +125°C 5 SOT23 ABZZ\nMAX4231 AXT+T -40°C to +125°C 6 SC70 ABA\nMAX4231AUT+T -40°C to +125°C 6 SOT23 ABNF\nMAX4231ART+T -40°C to +125°C 6 UCSP AAM\nMAX4231AYT+T -40°C to +125°C6 Thin µDFN  \n(Ultra-Thin LGA)+AH\nMAX4231DAC\nSHDN\nC\nRFRISO\nCLOADILOAD = 30mAANTENNA\nRPA2.7V TO 5.5V\nMAX4230–MAX4234 High-Output-Drive, 10MHz, 10V/μs, \nRail-to-Rail I/O Op Amps with Shutdown in SC70\n  Typical Operating CircuitOrdering Information\nSupply Voltage (V DD to V SS) ................................................6V\nAll Other Pins ...................................(V SS - 0.3V) to (V DD + 0.3V)\nOutput Short-Circuit Duration to V DD or V SS (Note 1) ...............10s\nContinuous Power Dissipation (Multilayer, TA = +70°C)  \n5-Pin SC70 (derate 3.1mW/°C above +70°C) ..............247mW  \n5-Pin SOT23 (derate 3.9mW/°C above +70°C)............313mW  \n6-Pin SC70 (derate 3.1mW/°C above +70°C) ..............245mW  \n6-Pin SOT23 (derate 13.4mW/°C above +70°C)........1072mW  \n6-Pin Thin µDFN (derate 2.1mW/°C above +70°C)...170.2mW \n6-Bump UCSP (derate 3.9mW/°C above +70°C) .....308.3mW  \n8-Pin SOT23 (derate 5.1mW/°C above +70°C).........408.2mW  8-Pin µMAX ® (derate 4.8mW/°C above +70°C) .......387.8mW  \n10-Pin µMAX (derate 8.8mW/°C above +70°C)  .......707.3mW  \n10-Bump UCSP (derate 5.6mW/°C above +70°C)  .....448.7mW  \n14-Pin SO (derate 11.9mW/°C above +70°C) ..........952.4mW  \n14-Pin TSSOP (derate 10mW/°C above +70°C)  ......796.8mW \nOperating  Temperature Range .........................-40°C to +125°C \nJunction Temperature ......................................................+150°C\nStorage Temperature Range .............................-65°C to +150°C \nLead Temperature \n(excluding 6 and 10 UCSP, soldering, 10s) ................+300°C\nSoldering Temperature (reflow) .......................................+260°C\n(VDD = 2.7V, V SS = 0V, V CM = V DD/2, VOUT = (V DD/2), RL = ∞ connected to (V DD/2), VSHDN  = V DD, TA = +25°C, unless otherwise \nnoted.)

The n-channel \nstage is active for common-mode input voltages typically \ngreater than (V SS + 1.2V), and the p-channel stage is \nactive for common-mode input voltages typically less than \n(VDD - 1.2V).\nApplications Information\nPackage Power Dissipation\nWarning: Due to the high output current drive, this \nop amp can exceed the absolute maximum power-\ndissipation rating.  As a general rule, as long as the \npeak current is less than or equal to 40mA, the maximum package power dissipation is not exceeded for any of the \npackage types offered. There are some exceptions to this \nrule, however. The absolute maximum power-dissipation \nrating of each package should always be verified using \nthe following equations. The equation below gives an \napproximation of the package power dissipation:\nIC(DISS) RMS RMSP V  I  COS ≅θ\nwhere:\nVRMS = RMS voltage from V DD to V OUT when sourcing \ncurrent and RMS voltage from V OUT to V SS when sinking \ncurrent.\nIRMS = RMS current flowing out of or into the op amp and \nthe load.\nθ = phase difference between the voltage and the current.\nFor resistive loads, COS θ = 1.

This configuration eliminates \nthe need for the large coupling capacitor required by the \nsingle op-amp speaker driver when single-supply opera -\ntion is necessary. Voltage gain is set to 10V/V; however, \nit can be changed by adjusting the 82kΩ resistor value.\nRail-to-Rail Input Stage\nThe MAX4230–MAX4234 CMOS op amps have parallel \nconnected n- and p-channel differential input stages that \ncombine to accept a common-mode range extending \nto both supply rails. The n-channel stage is active for \ncommon-mode input voltages typically greater than (V SS \n+ 1.2V), and the p-channel stage is active for common-\nmode input voltages typically less than (V DD - 1.2V).Rail-to-Rail Output Stage\nThe minimum output is within millivolts of ground for \nsingle-supply operation, where the load is referenced to \nground (V SS). Figure 4 shows the input voltage range \nand the output voltage swing of a MAX4230 connected \nas a voltage follower. The maximum output voltage swing \nis load dependent; however, it is guaranteed to be within \n500mV of the positive rail (V DD = 2.7V) even with maxi-\nmum load (32Ω to ground).\nObserve the Absolute Maximum Ratings  for power dis-\nsipation and output short-circuit duration (10s, max)\nbecause the output current can exceed 200mA (see the \nTypical Operating Characteristics .)\nInput Capacitance\nOne consequence of the parallel-connected differential \ninput stages for rail-to-rail operation is a relatively large \ninput capacitance C IN (5pF typ). This introduces a pole \nat frequency (2πR′C IN)-1, where R′ is the parallel com-\nbination of the gain-setting resistors for the inverting or \nnoninverting amplifier configuration (Figure 5). If the pole \nfrequency is less than or comparable to the unity-gain \nbandwidth (10MHz), the phase margin is reduced, and \nthe amplifier exhibits degraded AC performance through \neither ringing in the step response or sustained oscilla -\ntions. The pole frequency is 10MHz when R′ = 2kΩ. To \nmaximize stability, R′ << 2kΩ is recommended.Figure 3. Dual MAX4230/MAX4231 Bridge Amplifier for 200mW \nat 3VFigure 4.

When \nthe shutdown pin (SHDN) is pulled low, supply current \ndrops to 0.5μA per amplifier (V DD = 2.7V), the amplifiers \nare disabled, and their outputs are driven to V SS. Since \nthe outputs are actively driven to V SS in shutdown, any \npullup resistor on the output causes a current drain from \nthe supply. Pulling SHDN high enables the amplifier. In \nthe dual MAX4233, the two amplifiers shut down indepen -\ndently. Figure 10 shows the MAX4231’s output voltage \nto a shutdown pulse. The MAX4231–MAX4234 typically \nsettle within 5μs after power-up.
