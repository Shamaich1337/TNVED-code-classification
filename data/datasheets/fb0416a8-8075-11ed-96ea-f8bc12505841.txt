For optimum linearity performance, it is            \nrecommended to bias this device at  V D = 4 V with I D = 100 mA. It is also recommended to use active biasing to \ncontrol the drain currents because this gives the most reproducible results over temperature or RF level                 \nvariations. Depending on the supply voltage available and the power dissipation constraints, the bias circuit may \nbe a single transistor or a low power operational amplifier, with a low value resistor in series with the drain supply \nused to sense the current. The gate of the pHEMT is controlled to maintain correct drain current and thus drain \nvoltage. The typical gate voltage needed to do this is -0.5 V. Typically the gate is protected with Silicon diodes to \nlimit the applied voltage. Also, make sure to sequence the applied voltage to ensure negative gate bias is       \navailable before applying the positive drain supply.
