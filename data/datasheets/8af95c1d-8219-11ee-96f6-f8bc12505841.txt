General description\nThe PCA9555 is a 24-pin CMOS device that provides 16 bits of General Purpose parallel \nInput/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications and was developed to \nenhance the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders. The improvements \ninclude higher drive capa bility, 5 V I/O tolerance, lower supply current, individual I/O \nconfiguration, and smaller packaging. I/O expanders provide a simple solution when \nadditional I/O is needed for ACPI power swit ches, sensors, push buttons, LEDs, fans, etc.\nThe PCA9555 consists of two 8-bit Configurati on (Input or Output selection); Input, Output \nand Polarity Inversion (active HIGH or acti ve LOW operation) registers. The system \nmaster can enable the I/Os as either inputs or outputs by writing to the I/O configuration \nbits. The data for each Input or Output is kept in the corresponding Input or Output \nregister. The polarity of the read register  can be inverted with the Polarity Inversion \nregister. All registers can be read by the system master. Although pin-to-pin and I2C-bus \naddress compatible with the PCF8575, software changes are required due to the enhancements, and are discussed in Application Note AN469 .\nThe PCA9555 open-drain interrupt output is acti vated when any input state differs from its \ncorresponding input port register state and is used to indicate to the system master that \nan input state has changed. The power-on reset sets the registers to their default values \nand initializes the device state machine.\nThree hardware pins (A0, A1, A2) vary the fixed I\n2C-bus address and allow up to eight \ndevices to share the same I2C-bus/SMBus. The fixed I2C-bus address of the PCA9555 is \nthe same as the PCA9554, allowing up to ei ght of these devices in any combination to \nshare the same I2C-bus/SMBus.\n2.

If a bit in this register is set (written \nwith ‘1’), the corresponding port pin is enabl ed as an input with high-impedance output \ndriver. If a bit in this register is cleared (wri tten with ‘0’), the corresponding port pin is \nenabled as an output. Note that there is a high value resistor tied to V DD at each pin. At \nreset, the device\'s ports are inputs with a pull-up to V DD.\n \n \n6.3 Power-on reset\nWhen power is applied to V DD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9555 in a reset \ncondition until V DD has reached V POR. At that point, the reset condition is released and the \nPCA9555 registers and SMBus state machine w ill initialize to their default states. The \npower-on reset typically completes the reset and enables the part by the time the power \nsupply is above V POR. However, when it is required to reset the part by lowering the power \nsupply, it is necessary to lower it below 0.2 V.\n6.4 I/O port\nWhen an I/O is configured as an input, FETs Q1 and Q2 are off, creating a high-impedance input with a weak pull-up to V\nDD. The input voltage may be raised above \nVDD to a maximum of 5.5 V.\nIf the I/O is configured as an output, then either  Q1 or Q2 is on, depending on the state of \nthe Output Port register. Care should be exercised if an external voltage is applied to an \nI/O configured as an output because of the low-impedance path that exists between the \npin and either V DD or V SS.Table 11.

The command byte is \nsent after the address and de termines which register will receive the data following the \ncommand byte.\nThe eight registers within the PCA9555 are configured to operate as four register pairs. \nThe four pairs are Input Ports, Output Ports,  Polarity Inversion Ports, and Configuration \nPorts. After sending data to one register, the next data byte will be sent to the other register in the pair (see Figure 9\n and Figure 10 ). For example, if the first byte is sent to \nOutput Port 1 (register 3), then the next byte will be stored in Output Port 0 (register 2). \nThere is no limitation on the number of data bytes sent in one write transmission. In this \nway, each 8-bit register may be updated  independently of the other registers.At power-on reset, all registers return to default values.\nFig 8.

The command byte is sent after the address and determines which register will \nbe accessed. After a restart, th e device address is sent again, but this time the least \nsignificant bit is set to a logic 1. Data from the register defined by the command byte will \nthen be sent by the PCA9555 (see Figure 11 , Figure 12  and Figure 13 ). Data is clocked \ninto the register on the falling edge of the acknowledge clock pu lse. After the first byte is \nread, additional bytes may be read but the data will now re flect the informati on in the other \nregister in the pair. For example, if you read Input Port 1, then the next byte read would be \nInput Port 0. There is no limitation on the number of data bytes received in one read \ntransmission but the final byte received, the bus master must not acknowledge the data.\n \nRemark: Transfer can be stopped at any time by a STOP condition.\nFig 11.

The interr upt is deactivated when the input returns to its \nprevious state or the Input Port register is read (see Figure 12 ). A pin configured as an \noutput cannot cause an interrup t. Since each 8-bit port is read independently, the interrupt \ncaused by Port 0 will not be cleared by a read of Port 1 or the other way around.\nRemark: Changing an I/O from an output to an input may cause a false interrupt to occur \nif the state of the pin does not match th e contents of the Input Port register.\n7. Characteristics of the I2C-bus\nThe I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two \nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n7.1 Bit transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time will be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 14\n).\n \n7.1.1 START and STOP conditions\nBoth data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW \ntransition of the data line while the clock is HI GH is defined as the START condition (S). A \nLOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP \ncondition (P) (see Figure 15 ).\n Fig 14.

The \ndevice that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by \nthe master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 16 ).\n \n7.3 Acknowledge\nThe number of data bytes transferred betwe en the START and the STOP conditions from \ntransmitter to receiver is not limited. Ea ch byte of eight bits is followed by one \nacknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, \nwhereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.\nA slave receiver which is addressed must gen erate an acknowledge af ter the reception of \neach byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte \nthat has been clocked out of the slave transm itter. The device that acknowledges has to \npull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable \nLOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold \ntime must be taken into account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of da ta to the transmitter by not generating an \nacknowledge on the last byte that has been cloc ked out of the slave. In this event, the \ntransmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP \ncondition.\n Fig 16.

Handling information\nAll input and output pins are protected ag ainst ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under \nnormal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as \ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n15. Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n15.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n15.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n15.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nPCA9555 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2017.

It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 16  and 17\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 30 .Table 16.

Soldering of throug h-hole mount packages\n16.1 Introduction to solderi ng through-hole mount packages\nThis text gives a very brief insight into wave, dip and manual soldering.\nWave soldering is the preferred method for mounting of through-hole mount IC packages \non a printed-circuit board.\n16.2 Soldering by dipping or by solder wave\nDriven by legislation and environmental forc es the worldwide use of lead-free solder \npastes is increasing. Typical dwell time of the leads in the wave ranges from 3 seconds to 4 seconds at 250 \uf0b0C or 265 \uf0b0C, depending on solder material applied, SnPb \nor Pb-free respectively.\nThe total contact time of successive solder waves must not exceed 5 seconds.\nThe device may be mounted up to the seati ng plane, but the temperature of the plastic \nbody must not exceed the specified maximum storage temperature (T\nstg(max) ). If the \nprinted-circuit board has been pre-heated, forced cooling may be necessary immediately \nafter soldering to keep the temperature within the permissible limit.\n16.3 Manual soldering\nApply the soldering iron (24 V or less) to the lead(s) of the package, either below the \nseating plane or not more than 2 mm above it. If  the temperature of the soldering iron bit is \nless than 300 \uf0b0C it may remain in contact for up to 10 seconds. If the bit temperature is \nbetween 300 \uf0b0C and 400 \uf0b0C, contact may be up to 5 seconds.MSL: Moisture Sensitivity Level\nFig 30.

#### Description:
The **PCA9555** is a 24-pin CMOS device designed to provide 16 bits of General Purpose parallel Input/Output (GPIO) expansion for I2C-bus/SMBus applications. It enhances the NXP Semiconductors family of I2C-bus I/O expanders with features such as higher drive capability, 5 V I/O tolerance, lower supply current, and individual I/O configuration. The device includes two 8-bit configuration registers for input/output selection, as well as registers for input, output, and polarity inversion.

#### Typical Applications:
The PCA9555 is typically used in applications requiring additional I/O capabilities, such as:
- **Power Management**: Control of ACPI power switches.
- **Sensor Interfaces**: Connecting various sensors to a microcontroller.
- **User Interface Elements**: Managing push buttons and LEDs.
- **Fan Control**: Operating fans based on sensor inputs.
- **Data Acquisition**: Expanding the number of inputs for data collection in embedded systems.

This component is particularly useful in systems where multiple devices need to communicate over a shared I2C bus, allowing for efficient use of limited microcontroller pins while providing flexibility in I/O configuration.
