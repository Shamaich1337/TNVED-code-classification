It generates the linear product of its X and Y voltage inputs with a − 3 dB output bandwidth of \n250 MHz (a small signal rise time of 1 ns). Full- scale (− 1 V to \n+1 V) rise to fall times are 2.5 ns (with a standard R\nL of 150 Ω), \nand the settling time to 0.1% under the same conditions is typically 20 ns.  \nIts differential multiplication inputs (X, Y) and its summing input (Z) are at high impedance. The low impedance output voltage (W) can provide up to ±2.5 V and drive loads as low as 25 Ω. Normal operation is from ±5 V supplies.  \nThough providing state -of-the-art speed, the AD835 is simple \nto use and versatile. For example, as well as permitting the addition of a signal at the output, the Z input provides the means to operate the AD835 with voltage gains up to about ×10. \nIn this capacity, the very low product noise of this multiplier (50 nV/√Hz) makes it muc h more useful than earlier products.  \nThe AD835 is available in an 8 -lead PDIP package (N) and an \n8-lead SOIC package (R) and is specified to operate over the \n−40°C to +85°C industrial temperature ra nge.

E | Page 9 of 14 \nAD835 Data Sheet  \nTHEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD835 is a four -quadrant , voltage output analog multiplier, \nfabricated on an advanced dielectrically isolated complementary  \nbipolar process. In its basic mode, it provides the linear product \nof its X and Y voltage inputs. In this mode, the − 3 dB output \nvoltage bandwidth is 250 MHz ( with small signal rise time of 1 ns).  \nFull-scale (− 1 V to +1 V) rise to fall times are 2.5 ns (w ith a \nstandard R L of 150 Ω) , and the settling time to 0.1% under the \nsame conditions is typically 20 ns. \nAs in earlier multipliers from Analog Devices a unique \nsumming feature is provided at the Z input. As well as providing independent ground references f or the input and the output and \nenhanced versatility, this feature allows the AD835 to operate with voltage gain. Its X -, Y-, and Z -input voltages are all \nnominally ±1 V FS, with an overrange of at least 20%. The \ninputs are fully differential at high impedance (100 kΩ||2 pF) \nand provide a 70 dB CMRR (f ≤ 1 MHz).  \nThe low impedance output is capable of driving loads as small as 25 Ω. The peak output can be as large as ±2.2 V minimum for R\nL = 150 Ω, or ±2.0 V minimum into R L = 50 Ω. The AD835 \nhas much lower noise than the AD534 or AD734, making it  \nattractive in low level, signal processing applications, for \nexample, as a wideband gain  control element or modulator.  \nBASIC THEORY  \nThe multiplier is based on a classic form, having a translinear core,  \nsupported by three (X, Y , and Z) linea rized voltage -to-current \nconverters, and the load driving output amplifier. The scaling \nvoltage (the denominator U in the equations) is provided by a band gap reference of novel design, optimized for ultralow noise.  \nFigure 19 shows the functional block diagram.  \nIn general terms, the AD835 provides the function  \n( )( )ZUY Y X XW +− −=2 1 2 1(1 ) \nwhere the variables W, U, X, Y, and Z are all voltages. Connected  as \na simple multiplier, with X  = X1 − X2, Y = Y1 − Y2, and Z  = 0 \nand with a scale factor adjustment (see Figure 19) that  sets U =  1  V,  \nthe output can be expressed as  \nW = XY  (2) 00883-025X1\nX2X = X1 – X2\nZ INPUTY =Y1 – Y2AD835\nW OUTPUT\nY1\nY2XY XY  + ZX1+\n+\nF\nigure 19. Functional Block Diagram  \nSimplified representations of this sort, where all signals are presumed expressed in V , are used throughout this data sheet to avoid the  needless use of less intuitive subscripted variables \n(such as , V\nX1). All variables as being normalized to 1 V .  \nFor example, the input X can either be stated as being in the −1 V \nto +1 V range or simply –1 to +1. The latter representation is found  \nto faci litate the development of new functions using the AD835. \nThe explicit inclusion of the denominator, U, is also less helpful, as \nin the case of the AD835, if it is not an electrical input variable.  \nSCALING ADJUSTMENT \nThe basic value of U in Equation 1 is nominally 1.05 V . Figure 20, \nwhich shows the basic multiplier connections, also shows how the effective value of U can be adjusted to have any lower voltage (usually 1 V) through the use of a resistive  divider \nbetween W (Pin 5) and Z (Pin 4). Using the general resistor \nvalues shown, Equation 1 can be rewri tten as \n( ) ' 1 kW Z kUXYW − + + = (3 ) \nwhere Z' is distinguished from the signal Z at Pin 4. It follows that  \n( )'1ZU kXYW +−= (4 ) \nIn this way, the effective value of U  can be modif ied to \nU’ = (1 − k )U (5) \nwithout altering the scaling of the Z' input , which is expected because  \nthe only ground reference for the output is through the Z' input. \nTherefore , to set U' to 1 V , remembering that the basic value of \nU is 1.05 V , R1 must  have a nominal value of 20 × R2. The values \nshown allow U to be adjusted through the nominal range  of \n0.95 V to 1.05 V . That is, R2 provides a 5% gain adjustment.  \nIn many applications, the exact gain of the multiplier may not \nbe very important; in which case, this network may be omitted entirely, or R2 fixed at 100 Ω.  \n00883-020++\nR1 = (1–k) R\n2kΩ\nR2 = kR\n200Ω\nZ’FB\n+5V\nAD835\n4.7µF TANTALUM0.01µF CERAMIC\n0.01µF CERAMIC4.7µF TANTALUM\n1 2 3 48X W\nYX2 VP W\nY1X1\nY2 VN Z7 6 5\nFB\n+5V\nF\nigure 20. Multiplier Connections  \nRev. E | Page 10 of 14 \nData Sheet  AD835 \nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nThe AD835 is easy to use and versatile. The capability for adding \nanother signal to the output at the Z input is frequently valuable.  \nThree applications of this feature are presented here: a wideband \nvoltage-controlled amplifier, an amplitude modulator, and a \nfrequency doubler. Of course, the AD835 may also be used as a \nsquare law detector (with its X inputs  and Y  inputs connected in \nparallel). In this mode, it is useful at input frequencies to well \nover 250 MHz  because  that is the bandwidth limitation of the \noutput amplifier only.  \nMULTIPLIER CONNECTIO NS \nFigure 20 shows the basic connections for multiplication. The \ninputs are often single  sided, in which case the X2 and Y2 inputs  \nare normally grounded. Note that by assigning Pin 7 (X2) and \nPin 2 (Y2), respectively, to these (inverting) inputs, an extra \nmeasure of  isolation between inputs and output is provided. \nThe X and Y inputs may be reversed to achieve some desired \noverall sign with inputs of a particular polarity, or they may be driven fully differentially.  \nPower supply decoupling and careful board layout are  always \nimportant in applying wideband circuits. The decoupling recommendations shown in Figure 20 should be followed \nclosely. In Figure 21, Figure 23, and Figure 24, these power \nsupply decoupling components are omitted for clarity but  should \nbe used wherever optimal performance with high speed inputs is required. However, if the full, high frequency capabilities  of the \nAD835  are not being exploited, these components  can be omitted.  \nWIDEBAND VOLTAGE -CONTROLLED AMPLIFIER  \nFigure 21 shows the AD835 configured to provide a gain of \nnominally 0 dB to 12 dB. (In fact, the control range extends from  \nwell under – 12 dB t o about +14 dB.) R1 and R2 set the gain to \nbe nominally ×4. The attendant bandwidth reduction that comes  \nwith this increased gain is partially offset by the addition of the \npeaking capacitor C1. Although this circuit shows the use of dual supplies, the AD835 can operate from a single 9 V supply \n(such as a 9  V battery) with a slight revision.  For G = 0 dB, omit \nR1 and R2, and connect Pin Z directly to ground. Pin Z must be connected to a reference; ot herwise, the output W floats to a rail.  \n00883-021R1\n97.6Ω\nC133pF\nR2301ΩAD835\n1 2 3 48VOLTAGE\nOUTPUTVG\n(GAIN CONTROL)\nVIN\n(SIGNAL)X2 VP W\nY1X1\nY2+5V\n–5VVN Z7 6 5\nF\nigure 21.

For zero modulation, there is no product term so the  \ncarrier input is simply replicated at unity gain by the voltage \nfollower action from the Z input. At X = 1 V , the RF output is doubled, while for X = – 1 V , it is fully suppressed. That is, an \nX input of approximately ±1 V (actually ±U or about 1.05 V) \ncorresponds to a modulation index of 100%. Carrier and modulation frequencies can be up to 300 MHz, somewhat beyond the nominal − 3 dB bandwidth.  \nOf course, a suppressed carrier modulator can be implemented by omitting the feedforward to the Z input, grounding that  \npin instead.  \n00883-026+5V\n–5VAD835\n1 2 3 48\nX2MODULATION\nSOURCE MODULATED\nCARRIER\nOUTPUT\nCARRIER\nSOURCEVP W\nY1X1\nY2 VN Z7 6 5\nF\nigure 23.

The input can  have either polarity, but the \noutput in this case is always positive. The output polarity can  be \nreversed by interchanging either the X or Y inputs.  \nWhen the input is a sine wave E sin ωt, a signal squarer behaves \nas a frequency doubler  because  \n( )( ) ωtUE\nUωt E2 cos 12sin2 2\n− =  (6) \nWhile useful, Equation 6 shows a dc term at the output, which varies strongly with  the amplitude of the input, E.  \nFigure 24 shows a frequency doubler  that overcomes this \nlimitation and provides a relatively constant output over a moderately wide frequency range, determined by the time constant  R1C1 . The voltage ap plied to the X and Y inputs is \nexactly in quadrature at a frequency f = ½πC1R1, and their \namplitudes are equal. At higher frequencies, the X input becomes smaller while the Y input increases in amplitude; the opposite happens at lower frequencies. The result is a double frequency \noutput centered on ground whose amplitude of 1 V for a 1 V \ninput varies by only 0.5% over a frequency range of ±10%. Because there is no squared dc component at the output, sudden  \nchanges in the input amplitude do not cause a bounc e in the dc level.  \n00883-024AD835\n1 2 3 48VOLTAGE\nOUTPUT\nR297.6Ω\nR1R3301ΩX2 VP W\nY1X1\nY2+5V\nC1\n–5VVN Z7 6 5VG\nF\nigure 24.

Because the voltage across  \nthe capacitor (C1) decreases with frequency , while that across \nthe r esistor (R1) increases, the amplitude of the output varies \nonly slightly with frequency. In fact, it is only 0.5% below its full value (at its center frequency ω\nO = 1/C1R1) at 90% and 110% of \nthis frequency.  \nRev.
