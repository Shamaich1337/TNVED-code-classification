Each device contains one driver andone receiver, and the output pins can withstand faults,with respect to ground, of up to ±80V. Even if the faultsoccur when the transceiver is active, shut down, or pow-ered off, the device will not be damaged. The MAX3430operates from a 3.3V supply and features a slew-rate-lim-ited driver that minimizes EMI and reduces reflectionscaused by improperly terminated cables, allowing error-free data transmission at data rates up to 250kbps. TheMAX3430 has a 1/4-unit-load receiver input impedanceallowing up to 128 transceivers on a single bus and fea-tures fail-safe circuitry, which guarantees a logic-highreceiver output when the receiver inputs are open.\nHot-swap circuitry eliminates false transitions on the\ndata cable during circuit initialization or connection to alive backplane. Short-circuit current limiting and ther-mal-shutdown circuitry protect the driver against exces-sive power dissipation.\nThe MAX3430 is available in 8-pin SO and 8-pin PDIP\npackages, and is specified over commercial and indus-trial temperature ranges.\nApplications\nRS-422/RS-485 Communications\nLighting SystemsIndustrial-Control Local Area NetworksProfibus ApplicationsMultimaster RS-485 NetworksFeatures\no±80V Fault Protection\no±12kV ESD Protection\no+3.3V Operation\noInternal Slew-Rate Limiting\no250kbps Data Rate\noAllows Up to 128 Transceivers on the Bus\no-7V to +12V Common-Mode Input Voltage Range\noTrue Fail-Safe Inputs\noHot-Swap Input Structure on DE\noAvailable in 8-Pin SO and PDIP PackagesMAX3430±80V Fault-Protected, Fail-Safe,\n1/4-Unit Load, +3.3V RS-485 Transceiver\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 1Pin Configuration and Typical Operating CircuitOrdering Information\n1\n2\n3\n48\n5VCC 0.1µF\nGND DIDERERO R\nDRt Rt7\n6D\nRDE\nREDI\nROAB B\nAMAX343019-2756; Rev 1; 4/03\nFor pricing, delivery, and ordering information, please contact Maxim/Dallas Direct! at \n1-888-629-4642, or visit Maxim’s website at www.maxim-ic.com.PART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\nMAX3430CPA 0°C to +70°C 8 Plastic DIP\nMAX3430CSA 0°C to +70°C 8 SO\nMAX3430EPA -40°C to +85°C 8 Plastic DIP\nMAX3430ESA -40°C to +85°C 8 SO\nTOP VIEW\n1\n2\n3\n48\n7\n6\n5VCC\nB\nA\nGND DIDERERO\nDIP/SOR\nD\nMAX3430±80V Fault-Protected, Fail-Safe,\n1/4-Unit Load, +3.3V RS-485 Transceiver\n2 _______________________________________________________________________________________ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nDC ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS\n(VCC= +3.3V ±10%, T A= TMINto TMAX, unless otherwise noted.

Driving DE high enables the driver, whilepulling DE low places the driver outputs (A and B) intoa high-impedance state.\nReceiver\nThe receiver accepts a differential, RS-485 level input(A and B), and transfers it to a single-ended, logic-leveloutput (RO). Pulling RElow enables the receiver, while\ndriving REhigh and DE low places the receiver inputs\n(A and B) into a high-impedance state.\nLow-Power Shutdown\nForce DE low and REhigh to shut down the MAX3430. A\ntime delay of 1µs prevents the device from accidentallyentering shutdown due to logic skews when switchingbetween transmit and receive modes. Holding DE lowand REhigh for at least 1ms guarantees that the\nMAX3430 enters shutdown. In shutdown, the deviceconsumes 100µA supply current.\n±80V Fault Protection\nThe driver outputs/receiver inputs of RS-485 devices in\nindustrial network applications often experience voltagefaults resulting from transients that exceed the -7V to+12V range specified in the EIA/TIA-485 standard. Inthese applications, ordinary RS-485 devices (typicalabsolute maximum ratings -8V to +12.5V) require costlyexternal protection devices. To reduce system com-plexity and the need for external protection, the driveroutputs/receiver inputs of the MAX3430 withstand volt-age faults of up to ±80V with respect to ground without\ndamage (see the Absolute Maximum Ratings section,\nNote 1). Protection is guaranteed regardless of whetherthe device is active, shut down, or without power.True Fail-Safe\nThe MAX3430 uses a -50mV to -200mV differentialinput threshold to ensure true fail-safe receiver inputs.This threshold guarantees the receiver outputs a logichigh for shorted, open, or idle data lines. The -50mV to-200mV threshold complies with the ±200mV thresholdEIA/TIA-485 standard.\n±12kV ESD Protection\nAs with all Maxim devices, ESD-protection structuresare incorporated on all pins to protect against ESDencountered during handling and assembly. TheMAX3430 receiver inputs/driver outputs (A, B) haveextra protection against static electricity found in nor-mal operation. Maxim ’s engineers have developed\nstate-of-the-art structures to protect these pins against±12kV ESD without damage. After an ESD event, theMAX3430 continues working without latchup.\nESD protection can be tested in several ways. The\nreceiver inputs are characterized for protection up to±12kV using the Human Body Model.\nESD Test Conditions\nESD performance depends on a number of conditions.Contact Maxim for a reliability report that documentstest setup, methodology, and results.\nHuman Body Model\nFigure 8a shows the Human Body Model, and Figure8b shows the current waveform it generates when dis-charged into a low impedance. This model consists ofa 100pF capacitor charged to the ESD voltage of inter-est, which is then discharged into the device through a1.5k Ωresistor.\nDriver Output Protection\nTwo mechanisms prevent excessive output current and\npower dissipation caused by faults or bus contention.The first, a foldback current limit on the driver output\nCHARGE-CURRENT-\nLIMIT RESISTORDISCHARGE\nRESISTANCE\nSTORAGE\nCAPACITORCs\n100pFRC\n1MΩRD \n1.5kΩ\nHIGH-\nVOLTAGE\nDC\nSOURCEDEVICE\nUNDER\nTEST\nFigure 8a.

Thesecond, a thermal shutdown circuit, forces the driveroutputs into a high-impedance state if the die tempera-ture exceeds +160 °C. Normal operation resumes when\nthe die temperature cools by +140 °C, resulting in a\npulsed output during continuous short-circuit conditions.Hot-Swap Capability\nHot-Swap Inputs\nInserting circuit boards into a hot, or powered backplanemay cause voltage transients on DE, RE, and receiver\ninputs A and B that can lead to data errors. For example,upon initial circuit board insertion, the processor under-goes a power-up sequence. During this period, the high-impedance state of the output drivers makes themunable to drive the MAX3430 enable inputs to a definedlogic level. Meanwhile, leakage currents of up to 10µAfrom the high-impedance output, or capacitively couplednoise from V\nCCor GND, could cause an input to drift to\nan incorrect logic state. To prevent such a condition fromoccurring, the MAX3430 features hot-swap input circuitryon DE to safeguard against unwanted driver activationduring hot-swap situations. When V\nCCrises, an internal\npulldown circuit holds DE low for at least 10µs, and untilthe current into DE exceeds 200µA. After the initialpower-up sequence, the pulldown circuit becomestransparent, resetting the hot-swap tolerable input.\nHot-Swap Input Circuitry\nAt the driver enable input (DE), there are two NMOSdevices, M1 and M2 ( Figure 9). When V\nCCramps from\n0, an internal 15µs timer turns on M2 and sets the SRlatch, which also turns on M1. Transistors M2, a 2mAcurrent sink, and M1, a 100µA current sink, pull DE toGND through a 5.6k Ωresistor. M2 pulls DE to the dis-\nabled state against an external parasitic capacitanceup to 100pF that may drive DE high. After 15µs, thetimer deactivates M2 while M1 remains on, holding DElow against three-state leakage currents that may driveDE high. M1 remains on until an external current sourceovercomes the required input current. At this time, theSR latch resets M1 and turns off. When M1 turns off, DEreverts to a standard, high-impedance CMOS input.Whenever V\nCCdrops below 1V, the input is reset.VCC\nTIMER\nTIMER\nDEDE\n(HOT SWAP)15µs\n100µA\nM1 M25.6kΩ\n2mA\nFigure 9.
