For output voltages of 3.3V to 25V this pin should be tied to V\nOUT. If this pin is tied to a supply \nother than V OUT use a 1µF local bypass capacitor on this \npin. If no supply is available, tie to GND.\nINTV CC (Pin 2): Internal 3.4V Regulator Bypass Pin. The \ninternal power drivers and control circuits are powered from \nthis voltage. INTV CC maximum output current is 20mA. \nDo not load the INTV CC pin with external circuitry. INTV CC \ncurrent will be supplied from BIAS if BIAS > 3. 1V, otherwise \ncurrent will be drawn from V IN. Voltage on INTV CC will \nvary between 2.8V and 3.4V when BIAS is between 3.0V and 3.6V. Decouple this pin to power ground with at least a 1µF low ESR ceramic capacitor placed close to the IC. \nBST (Pin 3): This pin is used to provide a drive voltage, \nhigher than the input voltage, to the topside power switch. Place a 0.1µF  boost capacitor as close as possible to the IC.\nV\nIN1 (Pin 4): The LT8640/LT8640-1 requires two 1µF \nsmall input bypass capacitors. One 1µF capacitor should be placed between V\nIN1 and GND1. A second 1µF capacitor \nshould be placed between V IN2 and GND2. These capaci-\ntors must be placed as close as possible to the LT8640/LT8640\n-1. A third larger capacitor of 2.2µF or more should \nbe placed close to the LT8640/LT8640-1 with the positive \nterminal connected to V IN1 and V IN2, and the negative \nterminal connected to ground. See applications section for sample layout.\nGND1 (6, 7): Power Switch Ground. These pins are the \nreturn path of the internal bottom side power switch and must be tied together. Place the negative terminal of the input capacitor as close to the GND1 pins as possible. Also be sure to tie GND1 to the ground plane. See the Applica -\ntions Information section for sample layout.\nSW (\nPins 8, 9): The SW pins are the outputs of the internal \npower switches. Tie these pins together and connect them \nto the inductor and boost capacitor. This node should be kept small on the PCB for good performance and low EMI.\nGND2 (10, 11): Power Switch Ground. These pins are the \nreturn path of the internal bottom side power switch and must be tied together. Place the negative terminal of the input capacitor as close to the GND2 pins as possible. Also be sure to tie GND2 to the ground plane. See the Applica -\ntions Information section for sample layout.\nV\nIN2 (Pin 13): The LT8640/LT8640-1 requires two 1µF \nsmall input bypass capacitors.

See the Applications Information section for sample layout\n.\nEN/UV (Pin 14): The LT8640/LT8640-1 is shut down when this pin is low and active when this pin is high. The hysteretic threshold voltage is 1.00V going up and 0.96V going down. Tie to V\nIN if the shutdown feature is not used. \nAn external resistor divider from V IN can be used to pro -\ngram a V IN threshold below which the LT8640/LT8640-1 \nwill shut down.\nRT (Pin 15): A resistor is tied between RT and ground to \nset the switching frequency.TR/SS (\nPin 16): Output T racking and Soft-Start Pin. This \npin allows user control of output voltage ramp rate dur -\ning start-up. A TR/SS voltage below 0.97V forces the \nLT8640\n/LT8640-1 to regulate the FB pin to equal the TR/\nSS pin voltage. When TR/SS is above 0.97V, the tracking function is disabled and the internal reference resumes control of the error amplifier. An internal 1.9µA pull-up current from INTV\nCC on this pin allows a capacitor to \nprogram output voltage slew rate. This pin is pulled to ground with an internal 200Ω MOSFET during shutdown and fault conditions; use a series resistor if driving from a low impedance output. This pin may be left floating if the tracking function is not needed.\nSYNC/MODE (Pin 17, LT8640 Only): This pin programs \nfour different operating modes: 1) Burst Mode operation. \nTie this pin to ground for Burst Mode operation at low output loads— this will result in ultralow quiescent current. \n2) Pulse-skipping mode. This mode offers full frequency operation down to low output loads before pulse skipping occurs. Float this pin for pulse-skipping mode. When floating, pin leakage currents should be <1µA.

Drive this pin with a clock source to synchronize to an external frequency. During synchronization the part will operate in pulse-skipping mode.\nSYNC/MODE (Pin 17, LT8640-1 Only): For the LT8640-1, \nthis pin programs four different operating modes:  1) \nBurst Mode operation.  Tie this pin to ground for Burst \nMode operation at low output loads— this will result in \nultralow quiescent current.  2) Forced Continuous mode \n(FCM). This mode offers fast transient response and \nfull frequency operation over a wide load range.  Float \nthis pin for FCM.  When floating,  pin leakage currents \nshould be <1µA.  3) Spread spectrum mode.  Tie this pin \nhigh to INTV\nCC (~3.4V) or an external supply of 3V to \n4V for forced continuous mode with spread-spectrum modulation.  4) Synchronization mode.  Drive this pin with \na clock source to synchronize to an external frequency. During synchronization the part will operate in forced continuous mode. \nGND (Pins 18): LT8640/LT8640-1 Ground Pin. Connect \nthis pin to system ground and to the ground plane.  \nPG (Pin 19): The PG pin is the open-drain output of an \ninternal comparator. PG remains low until the FB pin is within ±8% of the final regulation voltage, and there are no fault conditions. PG is valid when V\nIN is above 3.4V, \nregardless of EN/UV pin state. \nFB (Pin 20): The LT8640/LT8640-1 regulates the FB pin to \n0.970V. Connect the feedback resistor divider tap to this pin. Also, connect a phase lead capacitor between FB and V\nOUT. Typically, this capacitor is 4.7pF to 22pF. \nSW (Exposed Pad Pins 21, 22): The exposed pads should be connected and soldered to the SW trace for good thermal performance.

D For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nThe LT8640/ LT8640-1 is a monolithic,  constant frequency, \ncurrent mode step-down DC/DC converter. An oscillator, \nwith frequency set using a resistor on the RT pin, turns on the internal top power switch at the beginning of each clock cycle. Current in the inductor then increases until the top switch current comparator trips and turns off the top power switch. The peak inductor current at which the top switch turns off is controlled by the voltage on the internal VC node. The error amplifier servos the VC node by comparing the voltage on the V\nFB pin with an \ninternal 0.97V reference. When the load current increases it causes a reduction in the feedback voltage relative to the reference leading the error amplifier to raise the VC voltage until the average inductor current matches the new load current.  When the top power switch turns off, the synchronous power switch turns on until the next clock cycle begins or inductor current falls to zero. If overload conditions result in more than 10A flowing through the bottom switch, the next clock cycle will be delayed until switch current returns to a safe level.\nIf the EN/UV pin is low, the LT8640/LT8640-1 is shut \ndown and draws 1µA from the input. When the EN/UV pin \nis above 1V, the switching regulator will become active.\nTo optimize efficiency at light loads, the LT8640/LT8640-1 \noperates in Burst Mode operation in light load situations. Between bursts, all circuitry associated with controlling the output switch is shut down, reducing the input supply current to 1.7µA. In a typical application, 2.5µA will be consumed from the input supply when regulating with no load. The SYNC/MODE pin is tied low to use Burst Mode operation and can be floated to use pulse-skipping mode (LT8640) or forced continuous mode (FCM) (LT8640-1). If a clock is applied to the SYNC/MODE pin, the part will synchronize to an external clock frequency and operate in either pulse-skipping mode (LT8640) or FCM (LT8640-1). \nWhile in pulse-skipping mode (LT8640 only), the oscilla -\ntor operates continuously and positive SW transitions are \naligned to the clock\n. During light loads, switch pulses are \nskipped to regulate the output and the quiescent current will be several hundred µA.  The LT8640-1 can operate in forced continuous mode (FCM)  for fast transient response and full frequency opera -\ntion over a wide load range. When in FCM the oscillator operates continuously and \npositive SW transitions are \naligned to the clock. Negative inductor current is allowed. The LT8640-1 can sink current from the output and return this charge to the input in this mode, improving load step transient response. \nTo improve EMI, the LT8640/LT8640-1 can operate in \nspread spectrum mode. This feature varies the clock with a triangular frequency modulation of +20%. For example, if the LT8640/LT8640-1’s frequency is programmed to switch at 2MHz, spread spectrum mode will modulate the oscillator between 2MHz and 2.4MHz. The SYNC/MODE pin should be tied high to INTV\nCC (~3.4V) or an external \nsupply of 3V to 4V to enable spread spectrum modula -\ntion with either pulse-skipping mode (LT8640) or forced continuous mode \n(LT8640-1).\nTo improve efficiency across all loads, supply current to internal circuitry can be sourced from the BIAS pin when biased at 3.3V or above. Else, the internal circuitry will draw current from V\nIN. The BIAS pin should be connected \nto V OUT if the LT8640/LT8640-1 output is programmed \nat 3.3V to 25V.\nComparators monitoring the FB pin voltage will pull the \nPG pin low if the output voltage varies more than ±8% (typical)  from the set point,  or if a fault condition is present.\nThe oscillator reduces the LT8640/LT8640-1’s operating frequency when the voltage at the FB pin is low. This frequency foldback helps to control the inductor current when the output voltage is lower than the programmed value which occurs during start-up or overcurrent condi -\ntions. When a clock is applied to the SYNC/MODE pin, the SYNC\n/MODE pin is floated, or held DC high, the frequency \nfoldback is disabled and the switching frequency will slow down only during overcurrent conditions.\nLT8640/LT8640-1\n14\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLow EMI PCB Layout \nThe LT8640/ LT8640-1 is specifically designed to minimize \nEMI emissions and also to maximize efficiency when \nswitching at high frequencies. For optimal performance the LT8640/LT8640-1 requires the use of multiple V\nIN \nbypass capacitors. \nT wo small 1µF capacitors should be placed as close as \npossible to the LT8640/LT8640-1: One capacitor should be tied to V\nIN1/GND1; a second capacitor should be tied \nto V IN2/GND2. A third capacitor with a larger value, 2.2µF \nor higher, should be placed near V IN1 or V IN2. \nSee Figure\xa01 for a recommended PCB layout. \nFor more detail and PCB design files refer to the Demo \nBoard guide for the LT8640/LT8640-1.Note that large, switched currents flow in the LT8640/LT8640-1 V\nIN1, VIN2, GND1, and GND2 pins and the input \ncapacitors (C IN1, CIN2). The loops formed by the input \ncapacitors should be as small as possible by placing the capacitors adjacent to the V\nIN1/2 and GND1/2 pins. Capaci-\ntors with small case size such as 0603 are optimal due to lowest parasitic inductance\n.\nThe input capacitors, along with the inductor and output capacitors, should be placed on the same side of the circuit board, and their connections should be made on that layer. Place a local, unbroken ground plane under the application circuit on the layer closest to the surface layer. The SW and BOOST nodes should be as small as possible. Finally, keep the FB and RT nodes small so that the ground traces will shield them from the SW and BOOST nodes. \nFigure\xa01.

To \nkeep thermal resistance low , extend the ground plane from \nGND1 and GND2 as much as possible, and add thermal vias to additional ground planes within the circuit board and on the bottom side. \nAchieving Ultralow Quiescent Current (Burst Mode \nOperation)\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LT8640/LT8640-1 \noperates in low ripple Burst Mode operation, which keeps \nthe output capacitor charged to the desired output voltage while minimizing the input quiescent current and minimiz -\ning output voltage ripple. In Burst Mode operation the LT8640\n/LT8640-1 delivers single small pulses of current \nto the output capacitor followed by sleep periods where the output power is supplied by the output capacitor.  While \nin sleep mode the LT8640/LT8640-1 consumes 1.7µA.\nAs the output load decreases, the frequency of single cur -\nrent pulses decreases (see Figure\xa02a\n ) and the percentage of time the LT8640/LT8640-1 is in sleep mode increases, \nresulting in much higher light load efficiency than for typi -\ncal converters. By maximizing the time between pulses, the converter quiescent current approaches \n2.5µA for a \ntypical application when there is no output load. Therefore, to optimize the quiescent current performance at light loads, the current in the feedback resistor divider must be minimized as it appears to the output as load current. \nIn order to achieve higher light load efficiency,  more \nenergy must be delivered to the output during the single \nsmall pulses in Burst Mode operation such that the LT8640/ LT8640-1 can stay in sleep mode longer be -\ntween each pulse.  This can be achieved by using a larger\n  \nvalue inductor (i.e ., 4.7µH ), and should be considered \nindependent of switching frequency when choosing an inductor.  For example,  while a lower inductor value \nwould typically be used for a high switching frequency application,  if high light load efficiency is desired,  a \nhigher inductor value should be chosen.

D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nWhile in Burst Mode operation the current limit of the top \nswitch is approximately 900mA (as shown in Figure\xa03), \nresulting in low output voltage ripple.  Increasing the output \ncapacitance will decrease output ripple proportionally. As load ramps upward from zero the switching frequency will increase but only up to the switching frequency programmed by the resistor at the RT pin as shown in Figure\xa02a. \nThe output load at which the LT8640/LT8640-1 reaches \nthe programmed frequency varies based on input voltage, \noutput voltage and inductor choice. To select low ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC/MODE pin below 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic low output).Forced Continuous Mode (LT8640-1 Only)\nThe LT8640 -1 can operate in forced continuous mode \n(FCM)  for fast transient response and full frequency opera -\ntion over a wide load range . \n When in FCM , the oscillator \noperates continuously and positive SW transitions are \naligned to the clock . Negative inductor current is allowed \nat light loads or under large transient conditions . The \nLT8640 -1 can sink current from the output and return \nthis charge to the input in this mode , improving load step \ntransient response ( see Figure \xa04). At light loads,  FCM \noperation is less efficient than Burst Mode operation or pulse-skipping mode , but may be desirable in applications \nwhere it is necessary to keep switching harmonics out of the signal band . FCM must be used if the output is \nrequired to sink current . To enable FCM (LT8640 -1 only ), \nfloat the SYNC /MODE pin . Leakage current on this pin \nshould be <1µA.  See Block Diagram for internal pull-up \nand pull-down resistance.\nFCM is disabled if the V\nIN pin is held above 37V or if the FB \npin is held greater than 8% above the feedback reference \nvoltage. FCM is also disabled during soft-start until the soft-start capacitor is fully charged. When FCM is disabled in these ways, negative inductor current is not allowed and the LT8640-1 operates in pulse-skipping mode.\nFor robust operation over a wide V\nIN and V OUT range, use \nan inductor value greater than L MIN:\n  LMIN=VOUT\n2 • fSW• 1–VOUT\n40⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\nFCM\nBURST MODE\nFRONT PAGE APPLICATION\n100mA to 1.1A TRANSIENT\n12V\nIN\n, 5V\nOUT\nC\nOUT\n = 47µF\n50µs/DIV\nV\nOUT\n200mA/DIV\nI\nLOAD\n1A/DIV\n8640 F04\nFigure\xa04.

First is the clock stays awake \nat all times and all switching cycles are aligned to \nthe clock. In this mode, much of the internal circuitry is awake at all times, increasing quiescent current to several hundred µA. Second is that full switching frequency is reached at lower output load than in Burst Mode operation (see Figure\xa02b). To enable pulse-skipping mode (LT8640 only), float the SYNC/MODE pin. Leakage current on this pin should be <1µA. See Block Diagram for internal pull-up and pull-down resistance.\nLT8640/LT8640-1\n17\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSpread Spectrum Mode\nThe LT8640/LT8640-1 features spread spectrum opera -\ntion to further reduce EMI emissions. To enable spread \nspectrum \noperation, the SYNC/MODE pin should be tied \nhigh to INTV CC (~3.4V) or an external supply of 3V to \n4V. In this mode, triangular frequency modulation is used to vary the switching frequency between the value programmed by RT to approximately 20% higher than that value. The modulation frequency is approximately 3kHz. For example, when the LT8640/LT8640-1 is programmed to 2MHz, the frequency will vary from 2MHz to 2.4MHz at a 3kHz rate. When spread spectrum operation is selected, Burst Mode operation is disabled, and the part will run in either pulse-skipping mode ( LT8640)  or forced continuous \nmode (LT8640-1). \nSynchronization \nTo synchronize the LT8640/LT8640-1 oscillator to an \nexternal frequency, connect a square wave (with 20% to 80% duty cycle) to the SYNC/MODE pin. The square wave amplitude should have valleys that are below 0.4V and peaks above 1.5V (up to 6V). \nThe LT8640/LT8640-1 will not enter Burst Mode opera -\ntion at low output loads while synchronized to an external \nclock\n, but instead will pulse-skip (LT8640) or run forced \ncontinuous mode (LT8640-1) to maintain regulation. The LT8640/LT8640-1 may be synchronized over a 200kHz to \n3MHz range. The RT resistor should be chosen to set the LT8640/LT8640-1 switching frequency equal to or below the lowest synchronization input. For example, if the synchronization signal will be 500kHz and higher, the RT should be selected for 500kHz. The slope compensation is set by the RT value,  while the minimum slope compensation \nrequired to avoid subharmonic oscillations is established by the inductor size, input voltage and output voltage. Since the synchronization frequency will not change the slopes of the inductor current waveform, if the inductor is large enough to avoid subharmonic oscillations at the frequency set by RT, then the slope compensation will be sufficient for all synchronization frequencies. FB Resistor Network\nThe output voltage is programmed with a resistor divider \nbetween the output and the FB pin. Choose the resistor values according to:\n R1=R2VOUT\n0.970V–1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟ (\n1)\nReference designators refer to the Block Diagram. 1% \nresistors are recommended to maintain output voltage accuracy. \nIf low input quiescent current and good light-load efficiency \nare desired, use large resistor values for the FB resistor divider. The current flowing in the divider acts as a load current, and will increase the no-load input current to the converter, which is approximately:\n IQ=1.7µA +VOUT\nR1+R2⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟VOUT\nVIN⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1\nn⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n (\n2)\nwhere 1.7µA is the quiescent current of the LT8640/\nLT8640-1 and the second term is the current in the feed -\nback divider reflected to the input of the buck operating at its light load efficiency n\n. For a 3.3V application with \nR1\xa0= 1M and R2 = 412k, the feedback divider draws 2.3µA. \nWith V IN = 12V and n = 80%, this adds 0.8µA to the 1.7µA \nquiescent current resulting in 2.5µA no-load current from the 12V supply. Note that this equation implies that the no-load current is a function of V\nIN; this is plotted in the \nTypical Performance Characteristics section. \nWhen using large FB resistors, a 4.7pF to 22pF phase-lead \ncapacitor should be connected from V OUT to FB. \nLT8640/LT8640-1\n18\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSetting the Switching Frequency\nThe LT8640/LT8640-1 uses a constant frequency PWM \narchitecture that can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to 3MHz by using a resistor tied from the RT pin to ground. A table showing the necessary R\nT value for a \ndesired switching frequency is in Table 1.\nThe R T resistor required for a desired switching frequency \ncan be calculated using:\n RT=46.5\nfSW–5.2\n (\n3)\nwhere R T is in kΩ and f SW is the desired switching fre-\nquency in MHz.\nTable 1.

The advantage of high frequency operation is that smaller induc -\ntor and capacitor values may be used. The disadvantages are lower efficiency and a smaller input voltage range\n. The highest switching frequency (f SW(MAX) ) for a given \napplication can be calculated as follows:\n fSW(MAX) =VOUT+VSW(BOT)\ntON(MIN) VIN– VSW(TOP) +VSW(BOT) ( ) (\n4)\nwhere V IN is the typical input voltage, V OUT is the output \nvoltage, V SW(TOP)  and V SW(BOT)  are the internal switch \ndrops (~0.4V, ~0.15V, respectively at maximum load) and t\nON(MIN)  is the minimum top switch on-time (see the \nElectrical Characteristics). This equation shows that a slower switching frequency is necessary to accommodate a high V\nIN/VOUT ratio. \nFor transient operation, V IN may go as high as the absolute \nmaximum rating of 42V regardless of the R T value,  however \nthe LT8640/LT8640-1 will reduce switching frequency as necessary to maintain control of inductor current to assure safe operation. \nThe LT8640/LT8640-1 is capable of a maximum duty cycle \nof approximately 99%, and the V\nIN-to-V OUT dropout is \nlimited by the R DS(ON)  of the top switch. In this mode the \nLT8640/LT8640-1 skips switch cycles, resulting in a lower switching frequency than programmed by RT.\nFor applications that cannot allow deviation from the pro -\ngrammed switching frequency at low V\nIN/VOUT ratios use \nthe following formula to set switching frequency: \nVIN(MIN) =VOUT+VSW(BOT)\n1– fSW• tOFF(MIN)– VSW(BOT) +VSW(TOP) (\n5)\nwhere V IN(MIN)  is the minimum input voltage without \nskipped cycles, V OUT is the output voltage, V SW(TOP)  and \nVSW(BOT)  are the internal switch drops (~0.4V, ~0.15V, \nrespectively at maximum load), f SW is the switching fre -\nquency ( set by R T), and t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum switch \noff-time.  Note that higher switching frequency will increase \nthe minimum input voltage below which cycles will be \ndropped to achieve higher duty cycle.\nLT8640/LT8640-1\n19\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nInductor Selection and Maximum Output Current\nThe LT8640/ LT8640-1 is designed to minimize solution size \nby allowing the inductor to be chosen based on the output \nload requirements of the application. During overload or short-circuit conditions the LT8640 /LT8640 -1 safely toler -\nates operation with a saturated inductor through the use of a high speed peak-current mode ar\nchitecture.\nA good first choice for the inductor value is:\n L=VOUT+VSW(BOT)\nfSW⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•0.7\n (\n6)\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency in MHz, V OUT is \nthe output voltage, V SW(BOT)  is the bottom switch drop \n(~0.15V) and L is the inductor value in µH. \nTo avoid overheating and poor efficiency, an inductor must \nbe chosen with an RMS current rating that is greater than the maximum expected output load of the application. In addition, the saturation current (typically labeled I\nSAT)  \nrating of the inductor must be higher than the load current plus 1\n/2 of in inductor ripple current: \n IL(PEAK) =ILOAD(MAX) +1\n2ΔIL (7)\nwhere ∆IL is the inductor ripple current as calculated in \nEquation 9 and I LOAD(MAX)  is the maximum output load \nfor a given application. \nAs a quick example, an application requiring 3A output \nshould use an inductor with an RMS rating of greater than 3A and an I\nSAT of greater than 4A. During long duration \noverload or short-circuit conditions, the inductor RMS rating requirement is greater to avoid overheating of the inductor. To keep the efficiency high, the series resistance (DCR) should be less than 0.02Ω, and the core material should be intended for high frequency applications. The LT8640/LT8640-1 limits the peak switch current in order to protect the switches and the system from overload faults. The top switch current limit (I\nLIM) is 10A at low \nduty cycles and decreases linearly to 7A at DC = 0.8. The \ninductor value must then be sufficient to supply the desired maximum output current (I\nOUT(MAX) ), which is a function \nof the switch current limit (I LIM) and the ripple current.\n IOUT(MAX) =ILIM–ΔIL\n2 (\n8)\nThe peak-to-peak ripple current in the inductor can be calculated as follows:\n ΔIL=VOUT\nL • fSW• 1–VOUT\nVIN(MAX)⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟\n (\n9)\nwhere f SW is the switching frequency of the LT8640/\nLT8640-1, and L is the value of the inductor. Therefore, \nthe maximum output current that the LT8640/LT8640-1 will deliver depends on the switch current limit, the inductor value, and the input and output voltages. The inductor value may have to be increased if the inductor ripple current does not allow sufficient maximum output current (I\nOUT(MAX) ) given the switching frequency, and \nmaximum input voltage used in the desired application.\nIn order to achieve higher light load efficiency,  more energy \nmust be delivered to the output during the single small \npulses in Burst Mode operation such that the LT8640/LT8640-1 can stay in sleep mode longer between each pulse. This can be achieved by using a larger value induc -\ntor (\ni.e., 4.7µH), and should be considered independent of switching frequency when choosing an inductor. For example, while a lower inductor value would typically be used for a high switching frequency application, if high light load efficiency is desired, a higher inductor value should be chosen. See curve in Typical Performance Characteristics.\nLT8640/LT8640-1\n20\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe optimum inductor for a given application may differ \nfrom the one indicated by this design guide. A larger value inductor provides a higher maximum load current and reduces the output voltage ripple. For applications requiring smaller load currents, the value of the inductor may be lower and the LT8640/LT8640-1 may operate \nwith higher ripple current. This allows use of a physically smaller inductor, or one with a lower DCR resulting in higher efficiency. Be aware that low inductance may result in discontinuous mode operation, which further reduces maximum load current.\nFor more information about maximum output current and \ndiscontinuous operation, see ADI’s Application Note 44. \nFor duty cycles greater than 50% (V\nOUT/VIN > 0.5), a \nminimum inductance is required to avoid subharmonic \noscillation (See Equation 10). See Application Note 19 for more details. \n  LMIN=VIN(2•DC−1 )\n3.5•fSW  (\n10)\nwhere DC is the duty cycle ratio (V OUT/VIN) and f SW is the \nswitching frequency.\nInput Capacitors\nThe V IN of the LT8640/LT8640-1 should be bypassed with \nat least three ceramic capacitors for best performance.  Tw o  \nsmall ceramic capacitors of 1µF should be placed close to \nthe part; one at the V IN1/GND1 pins and a second at V IN2/\nGND2 pins. These capacitors should be 0402 or 0603 in size. For automotive applications requiring 2 series input capacitors, two small 0402 or 0603 may be placed at each side of the LT8640/LT8640-1 near the V\nIN1/GND1 \nand V IN2/GND2 pins. \nA third,  larger ceramic capacitor of 2.2µF  or larger should \nbe placed close to V IN1 or V IN2. See layout section for more \ndetail.  X7R or X5R capacitors are recommended for best per -\nformance across temperature and input voltage variations. \nNote that larger input capacitance is required when a lower \nswitching frequency is used\n. If the input power source has \nhigh impedance, or there is significant inductance due to long wires or cables, additional bulk capacitance may be necessary. This can be provided with a low performance electrolytic capacitor.\nA ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high quality (under damped) tank circuit. If the LT8640/LT8640-1 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the LT8640/LT8640-1’s voltage \nrating. This situation is easily avoided (see ADI Applica -\ntion Note 88).\nOutput Capacitor and Output Ripple\nThe output capacitor has two essential functions\n. Along \nwith the inductor, it filters the square wave generated by \nthe LT8640/LT8640-1 to produce the DC output. In this role it determines the output ripple, thus low impedance at the switching frequency is important. The second function is to store energy in order to satisfy transient loads and stabilize the LT8640/LT8640-1’s control loop. Ceramic capacitors have very low equivalent series resistance ( ESR) \nand provide the best ripple performance. For good starting values, see the Typical Applications section.\nUse X5R or X7R types. This choice will provide low output \nripple and good transient response.  T ransient performance \ncan be improved with a higher value output capacitor and the addition of a feedforward capacitor placed between V\nOUT and FB. Increasing the output capacitance will also \ndecrease the output voltage ripple. A lower value of output capacitor can be used to save space and cost but transient performance will suffer and may cause loop instability.  See \nthe Typical Applications in this data sheet for suggested capacitor values.\nWhen choosing a capacitor, special attention should be \ngiven to the data sheet to calculate the effective capacitance under the relevant operating conditions of voltage bias and temperature. A physically larger capacitor or one with a higher voltage rating may be required. \nLT8640/LT8640-1\n21\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nCeramic Capacitors\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However, ceramic capacitors can cause problems when used with the LT8640/ LT8640-1 due to their \npiezoelectric nature. When in Burst Mode operation, the LT8640/LT8640-1’s switching frequency depends on the load current, and at very light loads the LT8640/LT8640-1 can excite the ceramic capacitor at audio frequencies, generating audible noise. Since the LT8640/LT8640-1 operates at a lower current limit during Burst Mode op -\neration, the noise is typically very quiet to a casual ear. If this \nis unacceptable, use a high performance tantalum or \nelectrolytic capacitor at the output.  Low noise ceramic capacitors are also available.\nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns the \nmaximum input voltage rating of the LT8640/ LT8640-1.  As  \npreviously mentioned,  a ceramic input capacitor combined\n  \nwith trace or cable inductance forms a high quality (un -\nderdamped) tank circuit. If the LT8640/LT8640-1 circuit is plugged into a live supply\n, the input voltage can ring to \ntwice its nominal value, possibly exceeding the LT8640/LT8640-1’s rating. This situation is easily avoided (see ADI Note 88).\nEnable Pin\nThe LT8640/LT8640-1 is in shutdown when the EN pin is \nlow and active when the pin is high. The rising threshold of the EN comparator is 1.0V, with 40mV of hysteresis. The EN pin can be tied to V\nIN if the shutdown feature is not \nused, or tied to a logic level if shutdown control is required.\nAdding a resistor divider from V IN to EN programs the \nLT8640/LT8640-1 to regulate the output only when V IN is \nabove a desired voltage (see the Block Diagram). Typically, \nthis threshold,  VIN(EN), is used in situations where the input \nsupply is current limited, or has a relatively high source resistance. A switching regulator draws constant power from the source, so source current increases as source voltage drops. This looks like a negative resistance load to the source and can cause the source to current limit or latch low under low source voltage conditions. The V\nIN(EN)  \nthreshold prevents the regulator from operating at source voltages where the problems might occur. This threshold can be adjusted by setting the values R3 and R4 such that they satisfy the following equation:\n VIN(EN) =R3\nR4+1⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟•1.0V\n (\n11)\nwhere the LT8640/LT8640-1 will remain off until V IN is \nabove V IN(EN) . Due to the comparator’s hysteresis, switch-\ning will not stop until the input falls slightly below V IN(EN) .\nWhen operating in Burst Mode operation for light load \ncurrents, the current through the V IN(EN)  resistor network \ncan easily be greater than the supply current consumed by the LT8640/LT8640-1. Therefore, the V\nIN(EN)  resistors \nshould be large to minimize their effect on efficiency at low loads.\nINTV\nCC Regulator\nAn internal low dropout (LDO)  regulator produces the 3.4V \nsupply from V IN that powers the drivers and the internal \nbias circuitry. The INTV CC can supply enough current for \nthe LT8640/LT8640-1’s circuitry and must be bypassed \nto ground with a minimum of 1µF ceramic capacitor. Good bypassing is necessary to supply the high transient currents required by the power MOSFET gate drivers. To improve efficiency the internal LDO can also draw current from the BIAS pin when the BIAS pin is at 3.1V or higher. \nTypically the BIAS pin can be tied to the output of the LT8640/LT8640-1, or can be tied to an external supply of 3.3V or above. If BIAS is connected to a supply other than V\nOUT, be sure to bypass with a local ceramic capacitor. If \nthe BIAS pin is below 3.0V, the internal LDO will consume current from V\nIN. Applications with high input voltage and \nhigh switching frequency where the internal LDO pulls current from V\nIN will increase die temperature because \nof the higher power dissipation across the LDO. Do not connect an external load to the INTV\nCC pin.\nLT8640/LT8640-1\n22\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput Voltage T racking and Soft-Start\nThe LT8640/ LT8640-1 allows the user to program its output \nvoltage ramp rate by means of the TR/SS pin. An internal \n1.9µA pulls up the TR/SS pin to INTV CC. Putting an external  \ncapacitor on TR/SS enables soft starting the output to pre-\nvent current surge on the input supply.  During the soft-start  \nramp the output voltage will proportionally track the TR/SS \npin voltage.  For output tracking applications , TR/SS can \nbe externally driven by another voltage source. From 0V to 0.97V, the TR/SS voltage will override the internal 0.97V reference input to the error amplifier, thus regulating the FB pin voltage to that of TR/SS pin. When TR/SS is above 0.97V, tracking is disabled and the feedback voltage will \nregulate to the internal reference voltage . The TR /SS pin \nmay be left floating if the function is not needed.\nAn active pull-down circuit is connected to the TR/SS pin \nwhich will discharge the external soft-start capacitor in the case of fault conditions and restart the ramp when the faults are cleared. Fault conditions that clear the soft-start capacitor are the EN/UV pin transitioning low, V\nIN voltage \nfalling too low, or thermal shutdown.\nOutput Power Good\nWhen the LT8640/LT8640-1’s output voltage is within the \n±8% window of the regulation point, the output voltage is considered good and the open-drain PG pin goes high impedance and is typically pulled high with an external resistor. Otherwise, the internal pull-down device will pull the PG pin low. To prevent glitching both the upper and lower thresholds include 0.2% of hysteresis.\nThe PG pin is also actively pulled low during several fault \nconditions: EN/UV pin is below 1V, INTV\nCC has fallen too \nlow, V IN is too low, or thermal shutdown.\nShorted and Reversed Input Protection\nThe LT8640 /LT8640-1 will tolerate a shorted output . \nSeveral features are used for protection during output \nshort-circuit and brownout conditions. The first is the switching frequency will be folded back while the output is lower than the set point to maintain inductor current control. Second, the bottom switch current is monitored such that if inductor current is beyond safe levels switch -\ning of the top switch will be delayed until such time as the inductor current falls to safe levels\n.  \nFrequency foldback behavior depends on the state of the SYNC pin: If the SYNC pin is low the switching frequency will slow while the output voltage is lower than the pro -\ngrammed level. If the SYNC pin is connected to a clock sour\nce, floated or tied high, the LT8640/LT8640-1 will stay \nat the programmed frequency without foldback and only slow switching if the inductor current exceeds safe levels.\nThere is another situation to consider in systems where \nthe output will be held high when the input to the LT8640/LT8640-1 is absent. This may occur in battery charging applications or in battery-backup systems where a battery or some other supply is diode ORed with the LT8640/LT8640-1’s output. If the V\nIN pin is allowed to float and the \nEN pin is held high (either by a logic signal or because it is tied to V\nIN), then the LT8640/LT8640-1’s internal circuitry \nwill pull its quiescent current through its SW pin. This is acceptable if the system can tolerate several µA in this state. If the EN pin is grounded the SW pin current will drop to near 1µA. However, if the V\nIN pin is grounded while \nthe output is held high, regardless of EN, parasitic body diodes inside the LT8640/LT8640-1 can pull current from \nthe output through the SW pin and the V\nIN pin, which may \ndamage the IC. Figure\xa0 5 shows a connection of the V IN and  \nEN/UV pins that will allow the LT8640/LT8640-1 to run only when the input voltage is present and that protects against a shorted or reversed input\n.\nFigure\xa05.

Case Temperature RiseThermal Considerations and Peak Output Current\nFor higher ambient temperatures, care should be taken \nin the layout of the PCB to ensure good heat sinking of the LT8640/LT8640-1. The ground pins on the bottom of the package should be soldered to a ground plane. This ground should be tied to large copper layers below with thermal vias; these layers will spread heat dissipated by the LT8640/LT8640-1. Placing additional vias can reduce thermal resistance further. The maximum load current should be derated as the ambient temperature approaches the maximum junction rating. Power dissipation within the LT8640/ LT8640-1 can be estimated by calculating the total \npower loss from an efficiency measurement and subtract -\ning the inductor loss. The die temperature is calculated by multiplying the \nLT8640/ LT8640-1 power dissipation by the \nthermal resistance from junction to ambient. \nThe internal overtemperature protection monitors the junc -\ntion temperature of the LT8640/LT8640-1. If the junction \ntemperature \nreaches approximately 170°C, the LT8640/\nLT8640-1 will stop switching and indicate a fault condition until the temperature drops about 10°C cooler.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nTemperature rise of the LT8640/LT8640-1 is worst when operating at high load, high V\nIN, and high switching fre -\nquency. If the case temperature is too high for a given application\n, then either V IN, switching frequency, or load \ncurrent can be decreased to reduce the temperature to an acceptable level. Figure\xa0 6 shows examples of how \ncase temperature rise can be managed by reducing V\nIN, \nswitching frequency, or load.\nThe LT8640/ LT8640-1’ s internal power switches are \ncapable of safely delivering up to 7A of peak output cur -\nrent. However, due to thermal limits, the package can \nonly handle \n7A loads for short periods of time. This time \nis determined by how quickly the case temperature ap -\nproaches the maximum junction rating. Figure 6 shows an example of how case temperature rise changes with the duty cycle of a \n1kHz pulsed 7A load.\nThe LT8640/ LT8640-1’ s top switch current limit decreases \nwith higher duty cycle operation for slope compensa -\ntion. This also limits the peak output current the LT8640/LT8640\n-1 can deliver for a given application. See curve \nin Typical Performance Characteristics.\nFigure\xa07.
