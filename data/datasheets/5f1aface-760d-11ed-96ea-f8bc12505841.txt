B | 12 of 19The ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  are low dropout linear regulators\nthat use an advanced, proprietary architecture to provide high\npower supply rejection ratio (PSRR) and excellent line and load\ntransient response with a small 4.7 µF ceramic output capacitor. All\ndevices operate from a 2.5 V to 5.5 V input rail and provide up to\n1 A of output current. Supply current in shutdown mode is typically\n100 nA.\nFigure 27. Internal Block Diagram\nInternally, the ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  consist of a reference,\nan error amplifier, a feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass\ntransistor. Output current is delivered via the PMOS pass device,\nwhich is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier com-\npares the reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the\noutput and amplifies the difference. If the feedback voltage is\nlower than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device\nis pulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the\noutput voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the reference\nvoltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less\ncurrent to pass and decreasing the output voltage.\nThe ADP1706/ADP1707 are available in 16 fixed output voltage\noptions between 0.75 V and 3.3 V. The ADP1706 allows for\nconnection of an external soft start capacitor, which controls the\noutput voltage ramp during startup. The ADP1707 features a TRK\npin that allows the output voltage to follow the voltage at this pin.\nThe ADP1708 is available in an adjustable version with an output\nvoltage that can be set to between 0.8 V and 5.0 V by an external\nvoltage divider. All devices are controlled by an enable pin (EN).\nSOFT START FUNCTION (ADP1706)\nFor applications that require a controlled startup, the ADP1706\nprovides a programmable soft start function. The programmable\nsoft start is useful for reducing inrush current upon startup and for\nproviding voltage sequencing. To implement a soft start, connect a\nsmall ceramic capacitor from SS to GND. Upon startup, a 1.2 µA\ncurrent source charges this capacitor. The ADP1706 start-up output\nvoltage is limited by the voltage at SS, providing a smooth ramp-up\nto the nominal output voltage. The soft start time is calculated by\nTSS = VREF × (CSS/ISS) (1)where:\nTSS is the soft start period.\nVREF is the 0.8 V reference voltage.\nCSS is the soft start capacitance from SS to GND.\nISS is the current sourced from SS (1.2 µA).\nWhen the ADP1706 is disabled (using EN), the soft start capacitor\nis discharged to GND through an internal 100 Ω resistor.\nFigure 28. OUT Ramp-Up with External Soft Start Capacitor\nThe ADP1707 and ADP1708 have no pins for soft start; therefore,\nthe function is switched to an internal soft start capacitor, which sets\nthe soft start ramp-up period to approximately 48 µs. Note that the\nramp-up period is the time it takes OUT to go from 0% to 90% of\nthe nominal value and is different from the start-up time in Table\n1, which is the time between the rising edge of EN to OUT being\nat 90% of the nominal value. For the worst-case output voltage\nof 5 V, using the suggested 4.7 µF output capacitor, the resulting\ninput inrush current is approximately 490 mA, which is less than the\nmaximum 1 A load current.\nFigure 29. OUT Ramp-Up with Internal Soft Start\nADJUSTABLE OUTPUT VOLTAGE (ADP1708)\nThe ADP1708 can have its output voltage set over a 0.8 V to 5.0 V\nrange. The output voltage is set by connecting a resistive voltage\ndivider from OUT to ADJ. The output voltage is calculated by\nVOUT = 0.8 V (1 + R1/R2) (2)\nData Sheet ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. B | 13 of 19where:\nR1 is the resistor from OUT to ADJ.\nR2 is the resistor from ADJ to GND.\nThe maximum bias current into ADJ is 100 nA, so for less than\n0.5% error due to the bias current, use values less than 60 k Ω for\nR2.\nTRACK MODE (ADP1707)\nThe ADP1707 includes a tracking mode feature. As shown in Fig-\nure 30 , if the voltage applied at the TRK pin is less than the nominal\noutput voltage, OUT is equal to the voltage at TRK. Otherwise,\nOUT regulates to its nominal output value.\nFigure 30. ADP1707 Output Voltage vs. Tracking Voltage\nFor example, consider an ADP1707 with a nominal output voltage\nof 3.3 V. If the voltage applied to its TRK pin is greater than 3.3\nV, OUT maintains a nominal output voltage of 3.3 V. If the voltage\napplied to TRK is reduced below 3.3 V, OUT tracks this voltage.\nOUT can track the TRK pin voltage from the nominal value all the\nway down to 0 V. A voltage divider is present from TRK to the error\namplifier input with a divider ratio equal to the divider from OUT\nto the error amplifier, which sets the output voltage equal to the\ntracking voltage. Both divider ratios are set by postpackage trim,\ndepending on the desired output voltage.\nENABLE FEATURE\nThe ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  use the EN pin to enable and\ndisable the OUT pin under normal operating conditions. As shown\nin Figure 31 , when a rising voltage on EN crosses the active\nthreshold, OUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN crosses the\ninactive threshold, OUT turns off.Figure 31. ADP1706 Typical EN Pin Operation\nAs shown in Figure 31 , the EN pin has hysteresis built in. This\nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN\npin as it passes through the threshold points.\nThe EN pin active/inactive thresholds are derived from the IN\nvoltage. Therefore, these thresholds vary when changing the input\nvoltage. Figure 32  shows typical EN active/inactive thresholds when\nthe input voltage varies from 2.5 V to 5.5 V.\nFigure 32. Typical EN Pin Thresholds vs. Input Voltage\nData Sheet ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. B | 14 of 19CAPACITOR SELECTION\nOutput Capacitor\nThe ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  are designed for operation with\nsmall, space-saving ceramic capacitors, but they function with most\ncommonly used capacitors as long as care is taken with the\neffective series resistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output\ncapacitor affects stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 4.7\nµF capacitance with an ESR of 500 m Ω or less is recommended\nto ensure stability of the ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708 . Transient\nresponse to changes in load current is also affected by output\ncapacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves\nthe transient response of the ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  to large\nchanges in load current. Figure 33  and Figure 34  show the transient\nresponses for output capacitance values of 4.7 µF and 22 µF,\nrespectively.\nFigure 33. Output Transient Response, COUT = 4.7 µF\nFigure 34. Output Transient Response, COUT = 22 µF\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nConnecting a 4.7 µF capacitor from the IN pin to GND reduces the\ncircuit sensitivity to the printed circuit board (PCB) layout, especially\nwhen long input traces, or high source impedance, is encountered.\nIf greater than 4.7 µF of output capacitance is required, it is\nrecommended that the input capacitor be increased to match it.Input and Output Capacitor Properties\nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the\nADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708 , as long as they meet the minimum\ncapacitance and maximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors\nare manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different\nbehavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must\nhave a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance\nover the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R\nor X7R dielectrics with a voltage rating of 6.3 V or 10 V are\nrecommended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due\nto their poor temperature and dc bias characteristics.\nVOLTAGE TRACKING APPLICATIONS\nFigure 35. Voltage Tracking Feature Using the ADP1707\nFigure 35  shows an application where the ADP1707 tracking fea-\nture is used. An ADP1706 powers the input/output of a microproc-\nessor and an ADP1707 powers the core. At startup, the output of\nthe ADP1706 ramps to 2.5 V, which is divided down via a voltage\ndivider (R1 and R2) to a lower voltage at the TRK pin of the\nADP1707. The output of the ADP1707 thus follows the TRK pin and\nramps up steadily to 1.2 V. This implementation ensures that the\ncore of the processor powers up after the input/output.\nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD\nPROTECTION\nThe ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  are protected against damage\ndue to excessive power dissipation by current and thermal overload\nprotection circuits. The ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  are designed\nto reach current limit when the output load reaches 1.5 A (typical).\nWhen the output load exceeds 1.5 A, the output voltage is reduced\nto maintain a constant current limit.\nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the junction\ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme\nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation)\nwhen the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the\noutput is turned off, reducing the output current to zero. When\nthe junction temperature drops below 135°C (typical), the output is\nturned on again and output current is restored to its nominal value.\nData Sheet ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. B | 15 of 19Consider the case where a hard short from OUT to ground occurs.\nAt first, the ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  reach current limit so\nthat only 1.5 A is conducted into the short. If self-heating of the\njunction becomes great enough to cause its temperature to rise\nabove 150°C, thermal shutdown activates, turning off the output\nand reducing the output current to zero. As the junction temperature\ncools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts\n1.5 A into the short, again causing the junction temperature to rise\nabove 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C\ncauses a current oscillation between 1.5 A and 0 A that continues\nas long as the short remains at the output.\nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect the de-\nvice against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation,\ndevice power dissipation should be externally limited so junction\ntemperatures do not exceed 125°C.\nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS\nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the\nADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure\nthat the junction temperature stays below this maximum value,\nthe user needs to be aware of the parameters that contribute to\njunction temperature changes. These parameters include ambient\ntemperature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal\nresistance between the junction and ambient air ( θJA). The θJA\nvalue is dependent on the package assembly compounds used and\nthe amount of copper to which the GND pins of the package are\nsoldered on the PCB. Table 7  shows typical θJA values of the 8-lead\nSOIC and 8-lead LFCSP for various PCB copper sizes.\nTable 7.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to\nthe following:\nTJ = TA + (((VIN – VOUT) × ILOAD) × θJA) (5)\nAs shown in Equation 5 , for a given ambient temperature, input-to-\noutput voltage differential, and continuous load current, a minimum\ncopper size requirement exists for the PCB to ensure the junction\ntemperature does not rise above 125°C.

However, as can be seen from Table 7 , a\npoint of diminishing returns is eventually reached, beyond which\nan increase in the copper size does not yield significant heat\ndissipation benefits.\nThe ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708  feature an exposed pad on the\nbottom of both the SOIC and LFCSP packages to improve thermal\nperformance. Because the exposed pad is electrically connected\nto GND inside the package, it is recommended that it also be\nconnected to the ground plane on the PCB with a sufficient amount\nof copper.\nHere are a few general tips when designing PCBs:\n►Place the input capacitor as close as possible to the IN and GND\npins.\n►Place the output capacitor as close as possible to the OUT and\nGND pins.\n►For the ADP1706, place the soft start capacitor as close as\npossible to the SS pin.\n►Connect the load as close as possible to the OUT and SENSE\npins.\nUse of 0402 or 0603 size capacitors and resistors achieves the\nsmallest possible footprint solution on boards where area is limited.\nData Sheet ADP1706/ADP1707/ADP1708\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev.
