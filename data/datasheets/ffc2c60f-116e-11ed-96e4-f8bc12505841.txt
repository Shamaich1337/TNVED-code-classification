At 1.9 GHz, \nthe amplifier typically provides 13 \u2009dB gain,  +41\u2009dBm OIP3, \nand 1.3 \u2009dB Noise Figure while drawing 125 \u2009mA current.  \nThe device is housed in a  lead-free\u2009green \u2009RoHS  \ncompliant \u2009industry -standard  SOT-89 package.  \n \nThe TQP3M9007 has the benefit of having high linearity \nwhile also providing very low noise across a broad range of \nfrequencies.  This allows the device to be used in both \nreceive and transmit chains for high performance systems.  \nThe amplifier is internally matched using a high -\nperformance E -pHEMT process and only requires an \nexternal RF choke and blocking/bypass capac itors for \noperation from a single +5 \u2009V supply.  The internal active \nbias circuit also enables stable operation over bias and \ntemperature variations.  \n \nThe TQP3M9007 covers the 0.1 \u2009–\u20094 GHz frequency band \nand is targeted for wireless infrastructure or other \napplications requiring high linearity and/or low noise figure.
