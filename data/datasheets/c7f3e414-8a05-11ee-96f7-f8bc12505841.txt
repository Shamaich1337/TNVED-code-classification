E For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL APPLICATIONDESCRIPTIONMicropower Precision\nTriple Supply Monitors in 8-Lead MSOP \nand 5-Lead SOT-23 Packages\nThe LT C®1727 is a triple supply monitor intended for \nsystems with multiple supply voltages. Each supply moni -\ntor has its own open-drain output for individual supply \nmonitoring. A common open-drain reset output remains low until all three supplies have been in compliance for 200ms. T\night 1.5% accuracy specifications and glitch \nimmunity ensure reliable reset operation without false triggering.\nThe L TC1728 is functionally identical to the L TC1727 \nwithout the individual monitor outputs.\nThe RST output is guaranteed to be in the correct state \nfor V\nCC5/VCC25/VCC18 or V CC3 down to 1V. The L TC1727/\nL TC1728  may also be configured to monitor any one or \ntwo V CC inputs instead of three, depending on system \nrequirements.\nVery low (10µA typical) supply current makes the L TC1727/\nL TC1728 ideal for power conscious systems. \nThe L TC1727 is available in an 8-lead MSOP or SO pack -\nage and the L TC1728 is available in a 5-lead SOT-23 \npackage.\nT riple Supply Monitor with Power Good Output\n(3.3V , 2.5V and Adjustable)All registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.FEATURES\nAPPLICATIONSn Monitors Three Inputs Simultaneously\n \n L\nTC1727-5: 5V, 3.3V and ADJ\n \n L\nTC1727-2.5: 2.5V, 3.3V and ADJ\n \n L\nTC1728-5: 5V, 3.3V and ADJ\n \n L\nTC1728-2.5: 2.5V, 3.3V and ADJ\n \n L\nTC1728-1.8: 3V, 1.8V and ADJ\n \n L\nTC1728-3.3: 3.3V, 1.8V and ADJ\nn ±1.5% Threshold Accuracy Over T emperature\nn V ery Low Supply Current: 10µA Typ\nn 200ms Reset T ime Delay\nn Active Low RESET Output\nn Power Supply Glitch Immunity\nn Guaranteed RESET  for V CC3 ≥ 1V  \nor V CC5/VCC25/VCC18 ≥ 1V\nn L TC1727 Includes Monitor Output for Each Supply\nn L TC1727: 8-Lead MSOP and SO Packages\nn L TC1728: 5-Lead SOT-23 Package\nn Desktop Computers\nn Notebook Computers\nn Intelligent Instruments\nn Portable Batter y-Powered Equipment\nn Network Ser vers\nVCC3\nVCC5\nVCCARST\nGNDLTC1728-5\n1727/28 TA013.3V\n5V\n1.8V\n0.1µF61.9k\n1%\n100k\n1%DC/DC\nCONVERTERSYSTEM\nLOGIC\n0.1µFLTC1727-2.5\nR2\n1727/28 TA08R1 ADJUSTABLE\nSUPPLY3.3V\n2.5V10k\nPOWER\nGOOD\nSYSTEM\nRESET10k\nVCC3\nVCC25\nVCCA\nGNDCOMP3\nCOMP25\nRST\nCOMPA\nDocument Feedback\nLTC1727/LTC17282\nRev.

E For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSupply Monitoring\nThe L TC1727 is a low power , high accuracy triple sup -\nply monitoring circuit with three monitor outputs and a \n200ms microprocessor reset output\n.\nThe L TC1728 is a low power, high accuracy triple supply monitoring circuit with a single 200ms microprocessor reset output.\nAll three V CC inputs must be above predetermined thresh -\nolds for reset not to be invoked. The L TC1727/L TC1728 will assert reset during power\n-up, power-down and brownout \nconditions on any one or all of the V CC inputs.\nPower Detect\nThe L TC1727/L TC1728 are powered from the 3.3V/3V input \npin (V CC3), the 1.8V input pin (V CC18), the 2.5V input pin \n(VCC25) or the 5V input pin (V CC5), whichever pin has the \nhighest potential. This ensures the part pulls the RST pin low as soon as either input pin is ≥1\nV.\nPower-Up\nUpon power-up, either the V CC5/VCC25/VCC18 or V CC3 pin, \ncan power the part. This ensures that RST will be low \nwhen either V CC5/VCC25/VCC18 or V CC3 reaches 1 V. As long \nas any one of the V CC inputs is below its predetermined \nthreshold, RST will stay a logic low. Once all of the V CC \ninputs rise above their thresholds, an internal timer is started and RST is released after 200ms.\nRST\n is reasserted whenever any one of the V CC inputs \ndrops below its predetermined threshold and remains \nasserted until 200ms after all of the V CC inputs are above \ntheir thresholds.\nOn the L TC1727, each of the comparator outputs will be \nlow until the V CC input that is monitored by that compara-\ntor rises above the appropriate predetermined threshold. The COMP3, and COMP5/COMP25 outputs are guaran -\nteed to be in the correct logic state for either V\nCC3 or \n VCC5/VCC25 greater than 1V. The COMPA output requires \nthe internal bandgap reference to be valid before the correct logic state can be output. Therefore, the COMPA output will be held low until V\nCCA is above 1V and V CC3 \nor V CC5/VCC25 is greater than 2V (typ). Figure\xa01. T ransient Duration vs Comparator OverdrivePower-Down \nOn power-down, once any of the V CC inputs drop below \nits threshold, RST is held at a logic low. A logic low of \n0.3V is guaranteed until both V CC3 and V CC5/VCC25/VCC18  \ndrop below 1V.\nGlitch Immunity\nThe RST output of the L TC1727/L TC1728 have two forms \nof glitch immunity built in. First, the input monitors require \nthe input voltage to transition at least 10% of the input threshold (0.1 • V\nRTH) below the input threshold for ap -\nproximately 50µs in order to force the monitor output low. The duration of the transition must be longer for voltage transitions \nof lesser magnitude (see Figure\xa01). Secondly, \nthe reset pulse width of approximately 200ms acts to debounce the RST output ensuring that the RST output will always be in the correct state.\nThe individual monitor outputs of the L TC1727 do not have \nhysteresis and will track the monitor inputs relative to the monitor’s input threshold (V\nRTA, VRT25, VRT3 and V RT5). A \nvery slow moving input voltage with ripple riding on it may cause the individual monitor outputs (COMPA, COMP25, COMP3 and COMP5) to toggle on the ripple as the input voltage passes the input threshold. The slow response time of the L TC1727’s input monitors has a tendency to integrate signals on the inputs improving their immunity to noise and ripple.\nRESET MONITOR OVERDRIVE VOLTAGE (% OF V CC)0.1250TRANSIENT DURATION (µs)300350400450\n1 10 100\n1727/28 F01200\n150\n50\n0100\nLTC1727/LTC172811\nRev.

This is an obvious solution since the trip points for \nVCC3 and V CC5 will always be greater than the trip point \nfor V CCA.\nThe V CC5 input trip point is disabled if its voltage is \nequal to the voltage on V CC3 ±25mV and the voltage on \nVCC5 is less than 4.15V. In this manner, the L TC1727-5/  \nL TC1728-5 will behave as a 3.3V monitor and V CC5 reset \ncapability will be disabled.The V\nCC5 trip point is reenabled when the voltage on \nVCC5 is equal to the voltage on V CC3 ±25mV and the \ntwo inputs are greater than approximately 4.15V. In this \nmanner, the part can function as a 5V monitor with the 3.3V monitor disabled. When monitoring either 3.3V or 5V with V\nCC3 strapped \nto V CC5 (see Figure\xa02), the part determines which is the \nappropriate range. The part handles this situation as shown in Figure\xa03. Above 1V and below V\nRT3, RST is held \nlow. From V RT3 to approximately 4.15V the part assumes \n3.3V supply monitoring and RST is deasserted. Above \napproximately 4.15V the part operates as a 5V monitor . In most systems the 5V supply will pass through the 3.1V to 4.15V region in <200ms during power-up, and the \nRST output will behave as desired.

It features three independent supply monitors, each with its own open-drain output, allowing for individual monitoring of supply voltages. The device includes a common reset output that remains low until all monitored supplies are compliant for a specified duration (200 ms). The LTC1727 is characterized by its tight threshold accuracy of ±1.5% and low supply current, making it suitable for power-sensitive applications.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Desktop Computers:** Ensures that all power supplies are stable before allowing the system to operate.
- **Notebook Computers:** Monitors battery and power supply voltages to prevent system failures.
- **Intelligent Instruments:** Provides reliable reset signals for sensitive electronic equipment.
- **Portable Battery-Powered Equipment:** Ideal for low-power applications where battery life is critical.
- **Network Servers:** Monitors multiple voltage rails to ensure system reliability and stability.

The LTC1727 is particularly useful in applications where multiple voltage levels need to be monitored simultaneously, ensuring that the system operates correctly and safely under varying power conditions.
