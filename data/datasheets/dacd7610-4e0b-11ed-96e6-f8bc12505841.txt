Pin Descriptions \nSerial Clock (CLK): The SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the t iming for serial input and \noutput operations.  \n \nSerial Data Input, Output and I/Os (DI, DO and DQ 0, DQ 1): The FM25F005 supports standard \nSPI and Dual SPI operation. Standard SPI instructio ns use the unidirectional DI (input) pin to \nserially write instructions, addresses or data to t he device on the rising edge of the Serial Clock \n(CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidire ctional DO (output) to read data or status \nfrom the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \n \nDual SPI instructions use the bidirectional DQ pins  to serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edge of CLK and re ad data or status from the device on the \nfalling edge of CLK. \n \nChip Select (CS#): The SPI Chip Select (CS#) pin enables and disables device operation. \nWhen CS# is high, the device is deselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or DQ 0, DQ 1) pins \nare at high impedance. When deselected, the devices  power consumption will be at standby \nlevels unless an internal erase, program or write s tatus register cycle is in progress. When CS# \nis brought low, the device will be selected, power consumption will increase to active levels and \ninstructions can be written to and data read from t he device. After power-up, CS# must transition \nfrom high to low before a new instruction will be a ccepted. The CS# input must track the VCC \nsupply level at power-up (see “9 Write Protection” and Figure 25). If needed a pull-up resister on \nCS# can be used to accomplish this.  \n \nHOLD (HOLD#): The HOLD# pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. \nWhen HOLD# is brought low, while CS# is low, the DO  pin will be at high impedance and signals \non the DI and CLK pins will be ignored (don’t care) . When HOLD# is brought high, device \noperation can resume. The HOLD# function can be use ful when multiple devices are sharing the \nsame SPI signals. The HOLD# pin is active low.  \n \nWrite Protect (WP#): The Write Protect (WP#) pin can be used to prevent the Status Registers \nfrom being written. Used in conjunction with the St atus Register’s Block Protect (BP2, BP1 and \nBP0) bits and Status Register Protect (SRP) bits, a  portion as small as a 4KB sector or the entire \nmemory array can be hardware protected. The WP# pin  is active low.  \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          6 7. Memory Organization \nThe FM25F005 array is organized into 256 programmab le pages of 256-bytes each. Up to 256 \nbytes can be programmed (bits are programmed from 1  to 0) at a time. Pages can be erased in \ngroups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of 128 (32K B block erase), groups of 256 (64KB block \nerase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The FM25F00 5 has 16 erasable sectors , 2 erasable 32-k \nbyte blocks and 1 erasable 64-k byte block respecti vely. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater \nflexibility in applications that require data and p arameter storage.  \n \nTable 1 Memory Organization \nBlock  \n(64KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address Range  \n0 15 00F000h 00FFFFh \n: : : \n3 003000h 003FFFh \n2 002000h 002FFFh \n1 001000h 001FFFh \n0 000000h 000FFFh \n \nBlock  \n(32KB)  Sector  \n(4KB)  Address Range  \n1 15 00F000h 00FFFFh \n: : : \n9 009000h 009FFFh \n8 008000h 008FFFh \n0 7 007000h 007FFFh \n: : : \n1 001000h 001FFFh \n0 000000h 000FFFh \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          7 8. Device Operations \n8.1. Standard SPI \nThe FM25F005 is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial \nClock (CLK), Chip Select (CS#), Serial Data Input ( DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard \nSPI instructions use the DI input pin to serially w rite instructions, addresses or data to the device \non the rising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is use d to read data or status from the device on \nthe falling edge of CLK. \n \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supp orted. The primary difference between \nMode 0 and Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in \nstandby and data is not being transferred to the Se rial Flash. For Mode 0, the CLK signal is \nnormally low on the falling and rising edges of CS# . For Mode 3, the CLK signal is normally high \non the falling and rising edges of CS#. \n \nFigure 2 The difference between Mode 0 and Mode 3   \n \n8.2. Dual SPI \nThe FM25F005 supports Dual SPI operation when using  instructions such as “Fast Read Dual \nOutput (3Bh)” and “Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh)”. These  instructions allow data to be transferred to \nor from the device at two to three times the rate o f ordinary Serial Flash devices. The Dual SPI \nRead instructions are ideal for quickly downloading  code to RAM upon power-up (code-\nshadowing) or for executing non-speed- critical cod e directly from the SPI bus (XIP). When using \nDual SPI instructions, the DI and DO pins become bi directional I/O pins: DQ 0 and DQ 1. \n \n8.3. Hold \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, the HOLD#  signal allows the FM25F005 operation to \nbe paused while it is actively selected (when CS# i s low). The HOLD# function may be useful in \ncases where the SPI data and clock signals are shar ed with other devices. For example, \nconsider if the page buffer was only partially writ ten when a priority interrupt requires use of the \nSPI bus. In this case the HOLD# function can save t he state of the instruction and the data in the \nbuffer so programming can resume where it left off once the bus is available again.  \n \nTo initiate a HOLD# condition, the device must be s elected with CS# low. A HOLD# condition \nwill activate on the falling edge of the HOLD# sign al if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is \nnot already low the HOLD# condition will activate a fter the next falling edge of CLK. The HOLD# \ncondition will terminate on the rising edge of the HOLD# signal if the CLK signal is already low. If \nthe CLK is not already low the HOLD# condition will  terminate after the next falling edge of CLK. \nDuring a HOLD# condition, the Serial Data Output (D O) is high impedance, and Serial Data \nInput (DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip Select (CS#) signal should be kept \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          8 active (low) for the full duration of the HOLD# ope ration to avoid resetting the internal logic state \nof the device. \n \nFigure 3 Hold Condition Waveform \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          9 9. Write Protection \nApplications that use non-volatile memory must take  into consideration the possibility of noise \nand other adverse system conditions that may compro mise data integrity. To address this \nconcern, the FM25F005 provides several means to pro tect the data from inadvertent writes. \n \nWrite Protect Features \n\x01 Device resets when VCC is below threshold \n\x01 Time delay write disable after Power-up \n\x01 Write enable/disable instructions and automatic wr ite disable after erase or program \n\x01 Software and Hardware (WP# pin) write protection u sing Status Register \n\x01 Write Protection using Power-down instruction \n\x01 Lock Down write protection for Status Register unt il the next power-up \n\x01 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Sectors using Status \nRegister. \n \nUpon power-up or at power-down, the FM25F005 will m aintain a reset condition while VCC is \nbelow the threshold value of VWI, (See “12.3 Power- up Timing” and Figure 25). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are rec ognized. During power-up and after the VCC \nvoltage exceeds VWI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time \ndelay of t PUW . This includes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sec tor Erase, Block Erase, Chip \nErase and the Write Status Register instructions. N ote that the chip select pin (CS#) must track \nthe VCC supply level at power-up until the VCC-min level and t VSL  time delay is reached. If \nneeded a pull-up resister on CS# can be used to acc omplish this. \n \nAfter power-up the device is automatically placed i n a write-disabled state with the Status \nRegister Write Enable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Wri te Enable instruction must be issued before \na Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Era se or Write Status Register instruction will \nbe accepted. After completing a program, erase or w rite instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) \nis automatically cleared to a write-disabled state of 0. \n \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated  using the Write Status Register instruction and \nsetting the Status Register Protect (SRP) and Block  Protect (BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits. These \nsettings allow a portion as small as a 4KB sector o r the entire memory array to be configured as \nread only. Used in conjunction with the Write Prote ct (WP#) pin, changes to the Status Register \ncan be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See Status Register section for further \ninformation. Additionally, the Power-down instructi on offers an extra level of write protection as \nall instructions are ignored except for the Release  Power-down instruction. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          10  10. Status Register \nThe Read Status Register instruction can be used to  provide status on the availability of the Flash \nmemory array, if the device is write enabled or dis abled, the state of write protection, Security \nSector lock status. The Write Status Register instr uction can be used to configure the device write \nprotection features and Security Sector OTP lock. W rite access to the Status Register is \ncontrolled by the state of the non-volatile Status Register Protect bit (SRP), the Write Enable \ninstruction, and the WP# pin. \n \nFactory default for all Status Register bits are 0.  \n \nFigure 4 Status Register \n \n10.1. WIP Bit \nWIP is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is \nexecuting a Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase , Chip Erase, Write Status Register. \nDuring this time the device will ignore further ins tructions except for the Read Status Register \n(see t W, t PP , t SE , tBE , and t CE  in “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). When the  program, erase or \nwrite status register (or security sector) instruct ion has completed, the WIP bit will be cleared to a  \n0 state indicating the device is ready for further instructions.  \n \n10.2. Write Enable Latch bit (WEL) \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to 1 after \nexecuting a Write Enable Instruction. The WEL statu s bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write \ndisabled. A write disable state occurs upon power-u p or after any of the following instructions: \nWrite Disable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Er ase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register. \n \n10.3. Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) \nThe Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) are non-vola tile read/write bits in the status register (S4, \nS3, and S2) that provide Write Protection control a nd status. Block Protect bits can be set using \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          11  the Write Status Register Instruction (see t W in “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). All, non e or \na portion of the memory array can be protected from  Program and Erase instructions (see Table \n2 Status Register Memory Protection). The factory d efault setting for the Block Protection Bits is \n0, none of the array protected. \n \n10.4. Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB) \nThe non-volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if th e Block Protect Bits (BP2, BP1, BP0) protect \nfrom the Top (TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the arr ay as shown in Table 2 Status Register \nMemory Protection table. The factory default settin g is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the \nWrite Status Register Instruction depending on the state of the SRP and WEL bits. \n \n10.5. Status Register Protect bit / Lock_bit (SRP/L B) \nThe Status Register Protect (SRP) bit is operated i n conjunction with the Write Protect (WP#) \nsignal. The Status Register Write Protect (SRP) bit  and Write Protect (WP#) signal allow the \ndevice to be put in the Hardware Protected mode (wh en the Status Register Protect (SRP) bit is \nset to 1, and Write Protect (WP#) is driven Low). I n this mode, the non-volatile bits of the Status \nRegister (SRP, BP2, BP1, BP0) become read-only bits  and the Write Status Register (WRSR) \ninstruction is no longer accepted for execution. \nIn OTP mode, this bit is served as Lock_bit (LB), u ser can read/program/erase security sector as \nnormal sector while LB value is equal 0, after LB i s programmed with 1 by WRSR command, the \nsecurity sector is protected from program and erase  operation. The LB can only be programmed \nonce. \n \nNote : In OTP mode, the WRSR command will ignore an y input data and program LB to 1, user \nmust clear the protect bits before enter OTP mode a nd program the OTP code, then execute \nWRSR command to lock the Security sector before lea ving OTP mode. \n \n10.6.

Instructions \nThe Standard/Dual SPI instruction set of the FM25F0 05 consists of 17 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Table 4~T able 5 Instruction Set). Instructions are \ninitiated with the falling edge of Chip Select (CS# ). The first byte of data clocked into the DI input  \nprovides the instruction code. Data on the DI input  is sampled on the rising edge of clock with \nmost significant bit (MSB) first. \n \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to s everal bytes and may be followed by address \nbytes, data bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in  some cases, a combination. Instructions are \ncompleted with the rising edge of edge CS#. Clock r elative timing diagrams for each instruction \nare included in Figure 5 through Figure 29. All rea d instructions can be completed after any \nclocked bit. However, all instructions that Write, Program or Erase must complete on a byte \nboundary (CS# driven high after a full 8-bits have been clocked) otherwise the instruction will be \nignored. This feature further protects the device f rom inadvertent writes.

The WEL bit must be set pri or to every Page Program, Sector Erase, \nBlock Erase, Chip Erase, Write Status Register inst ruction. The Write Enable (WREN ) instruction \nis entered by driving CS# low, shifting the instruc tion code “06h” into the Data Input (DI) pin on \nthe rising edge of CLK, and then driving CS# high. \n \nFigure 5 Write Enable Instruction  \n \n11.5.

Read Status Register (RDSR) (05h)  \nThe Read Status Register instructions allow the 8-b it Status Registers to be read. The instruction \nis entered by driving CS# low and shifting the inst ruction code “05h” into the DI pin on the rising \nedge of CLK. The status register bits are then shif ted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of \nCLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure 7. The Status Register bits are \nshown in Figure 4 and include the WIP, WEL, BP2-BP0  and SRP bits. \n \nThe Read Status Register instruction may be used at  any time, even while a Program, Erase or \nWrite Status Register cycle is in progress. This al lows the WIP status bit to be checked to \ndetermine when the cycle is complete and if the dev ice can accept another instruction. The \nStatus Register can be read continuously.

Write Status Register (WRSR) (01h) \nThe Write Status Register (WRSR ) instruction allows the Status Register to be writte n. Only non-\nvolatile Status Register bits SRP, BP2, BP1, BP0 ca n be written to. All other Status Register bit \nlocations are read-only and will not be affected by  the Write Status Register (WRSR ) instruction. \nThe Status Register bits are shown in Figure 4, and  described in 10 Status Register. \n \nTo write non-volatile Status Register bits, a stand ard Write Enable (06h) instruction must \npreviously have been executed for the device to acc ept the Write Status Register (WRSR )  \ninstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1).  Once write enabled, the instruction is entered \nby driving CS# low, sending the instruction code “0 1h”, and then writing the status register data \nbyte as illustrated in Figure 8. \n \nTo complete the Write Status Register (WRSR ) instruction, the CS# pin must be driven high after \nthe eighth or sixteenth bit of data that is clocked  in. If this is not done the Write Status Register \n(WRSR ) instruction will not be executed.  \n \nDuring non-volatile Status Register write operation  (06h combined with 01h), after CS# is driven \nhigh, the self-timed Write Status Register cycle wi ll commence for a time duration of t W (See \n“12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). While the Wr ite Status Register cycle is in progress, the \nRead Status Register instruction may still be acces sed to check the status of the WIP bit. The \nWIP bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cyc le and a 0 when the cycle is finished and \nready to accept other instructions again. After the  Write Status Register cycle has finished, the \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register  will be cleared to 0. \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          16  =MSB High Impedance CS#\nCLK \nD0\n(DQ 1)DI \n(DQ 0)7       6       5       4       3       2       1       0 0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (01h)8       9      10     11     12     13     14     1 5 \nStatus Register in \n \nFigure 8 Write Status Register Instruction  \n \n11.8. Read Data (03h) \nThe Read Data instruction allows one or more data b ytes to be sequentially read from the \nmemory. The instruction is initiated by driving the  CS# pin low and then shifting the instruction \ncode “03h” followed by a 24-bit address A23-A0 into  the DI pin. The code and address bits are \nlatched on the rising edge of the CLK pin. After th e address is received, the data byte of the \naddressed memory location will be shifted out on th e DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with \nmost significant bit (MSB) first. The address is au tomatically incremented to the next higher \naddress after each byte of data is shifted out allo wing for a continuous stream of data. This \nmeans that the entire memory can be accessed with a  single instruction as long as the clock \ncontinues. The instruction is completed by driving CS# high. \n \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in Figu re 9. If a Read Data instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in proces s (WIP =1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effect on the current cycle. The Read Data instruction allows clock rates from D.C. \nto a maximum of f R (see “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). \n \nThe Read Data (03h) instruction is only supported i n Standard SPI mode. \n \nFigure 9 Read Data Instruction  \n \n11.9. Fast Read (0Bh) \nThe Fast Read instruction is similar to the Read Da ta instruction except that it can operate at the \nhighest possible frequency of F R (see “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). This i s accomplished \nby adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24-bit add ress as shown in Figure 10. The dummy \nclocks allow the devices internal circuits addition al time for setting up the initial address. During \nthe dummy clocks the data value on the DI pin is a “don’t care”. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          17   \n \nFigure 10 Fast Read Instruction \n \n11.10. Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) \nThe Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) instruction is simi lar to the standard Fast Read (0Bh) \ninstruction except that data is output on two pins;  DQ 0 and DQ 1. This allows data to be \ntransferred from the FM25F005 at twice the rate of standard SPI devices. The Fast Read Dual \nOutput instruction is ideal for quickly downloading  code from Flash to RAM upon power-up or for \napplications that cache code-segments to RAM for ex ecution. \n \nSimilar to the Fast Read instruction, the Fast Read  Dual Output instruction can operate at the \nhighest possible frequency of F R (see “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). This i s accomplished \nby adding eight “dummy” clocks after the 24-bit add ress as shown in Figure 11. The dummy \nclocks allow the device's internal circuits additio nal time for setting up the initial address. The \ninput data during the dummy clocks is “don’t care”.  However, the DQ 0 pin should be high-\nimpedance prior to the falling edge of the first da ta out clock. \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          18  \n \nFigure 11 Fast Read Dual Output Instruction  \n \n11.11. Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O (BBh) instruction allows for  improved random access while maintaining \ntwo I/O pins, DQ 0 and DQ 1. It is similar to the Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) instruction but with \nthe capability to input the Address bits A23-A0 two  bits per clock. This reduced instruction \noverhead may allow for code execution (XIP) directl y from the Dual SPI in some applications. \n \nFast Read Dual I/O with “Continuous Read Mode” \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O instruction can further redu ce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7-0) after the input Address bits A23-A0, as shown in Figure 12. \nThe upper nibble of the (M7-4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction \nthrough the inclusion or exclusion of the first byt e instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the \n(M3-0) are don’t care (“x”). However, the DQ pins s hould be high-impedance prior to the falling \nedge of the first data out clock. \n \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5-4 = (1,0), th en the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction \n(after CS# is raised and then lowered) does not req uire the BBh instruction code, as shown in \nFigure 13. This reduces the instruction sequence by  eight clocks and allows the Read address to \nbe immediately entered after CS# is asserted low. I f the “Continuous Read Mode” bits M5-4 do \nnot equal to (1,0), the next instruction (after CS#  is raised and then lowered) requires the first \nbyte instruction code, thus returning to normal ope ration. It is recommended to input FFFFh on \nDQ 0 for the next instruction (16 clocks), to ensure M4  = 1 and return the device to normal \noperation. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          19  0       1       2       3       4       5       6       7 Mode 3\nMode 0\nInstruction (BBh)CS#\nCLK \nDI \n(DQ 0)8       9      10     11     12     13     14     1 5 16     17     18     19     20     21     22     23  \n=MSB D0\n(DQ 1) 23      21    19     17     15     13     11      9  7       5       3       1       7       5       3       1 22     20     18     16     14     12     10      8  6       4       2       0       6       4       2       0 A23-16                   A15-8                     A7-0                    M7-0\n31     32     33     34     35     36     37     38      39 CS#\nCLK \nD0\n(DQ 1)DI \n(DQ 0)\n7       5       3       1       7       5       3       1 7 7       5       3       1       7       5       3       1 \nByte 16       4       2       0       6       4       2       0 6 6       4       2       0       6       4       2       0 IOs switch from \nInput to Output \n0\nByte 2 Byte 3 Byte 423     24     25     26     27     28     29     30\n1\n \nFigure 12 Fast Read Dual I/O Instruction (Initial i nstruction or previous M5-4 ≠ 10) \n \n \nFigure 13 Fast Read Dual I/O Instruction (Previous instruction set M5-4 = 10) \n \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          20  11.12. Page Program (02h) \nThe Page Program instruction allows from one byte t o 256 bytes (a page) of data to be \nprogrammed at previously erased (FFh) memory locati ons. A Write Enable instruction must be \nexecuted before the device will accept the Page Pro gram Instruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the CS# pin  low then shifting the instruction code “02h” \nfollowed by a 24-bit address A23-A0 and at least on e data byte, into the DI pin. The CS# pin must \nbe held low for the entire length of the instructio n while data is being sent to the device. The Page \nProgram instruction sequence is shown in Figure 14.  \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the  last address byte (the 8 least significant \naddress bits) should be set to 0. If the last addre ss byte is not zero, and the number of clocks \nexceeds the remaining page length, the addressing w ill wrap to the beginning of the page. In \nsome cases, less than 256 bytes (a partial page) ca n be programmed without having any effect \non other bytes within the same page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the \nnumber of clocks can not exceed the remaining page length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to \nthe device the addressing will wrap to the beginnin g of the page and overwrite previously sent \ndata. \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the CS# p in must be driven high after the eighth bit of the \nlast byte has been latched. If this is not done the  Page Program instruction will not be executed. \nAfter CS# is driven high, the self-timed Page Progr am instruction will commence for a time \nduration of t PP  (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). While the Page Program cycle is in \nprogress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of \nthe WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during the Page Pro gram cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is \nfinished and the device is ready to accept other in structions again. After the Page Program cycle \nhas finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in th e Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page \nProgram instruction will not be executed if the add ressed page is protected by the Block Protect \n(BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits. \n \nFigure 14 Page Program Instruction \n \n11.13. Sector Erase (20h) \nThe Sector Erase instruction sets all memory within  a specified sector (4K-bytes) to the erased \nstate of all 1s (FFh). A Write Enable instruction m ust be executed before the device will accept \nthe Sector Erase Instruction (Status Register bit W EL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by \ndriving the CS# pin low and shifting the instructio n code “20h” followed a 24-bit sector address \nA23-A0 (see Figure 1). The Sector Erase instruction  sequence is shown in Figure 15 . \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bi t of the last byte has been latched.

After CS# is driven high, the self-timed \nSector Erase instruction will commence for a time d uration of t SE  (See “12.6 AC Electrical \nCharacteristics”). While the Sector Erase cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register \ninstruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the WIP bit. The WIP bit is a 1 during \nthe Sector Erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cyc le is finished and the device is ready to \naccept other instructions again. After the Sector E rase cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. T he Sector Erase instruction will not be executed \nif the addressed page is protected by the Block Pro tect (BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits (see Table 2 \nStatus Register Memory Protection table). \n \nFigure 15 Sector Erase Instruction  \n \n11.14. 32KB Block Erase (BE32) (52h) \nThe 32KB Block Erase instruction sets all memory wi thin a specified block (32K-bytes) to the \nerased state of all 1s (FFh). A Write Enable instru ction must be executed before the device will \naccept the Block Erase Instruction (Status Register  bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting t he instruction code “52h” followed a 24-bit block \naddress A23-A0. The Block Erase instruction sequenc e is shown in Figure 16. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bi t of the last byte has been latched.

The Block Eras e instruction will not be executed if the \naddressed page is protected by the Block Protect (B P2, BP1, and BP0) bits (see Table 2 Status \nRegister Memory Protection table). \n \nFigure 17 Block Erase Instruction  \n \n11.16. Chip Erase (CE) (C7h / 60h) \nThe Chip Erase instruction sets all memory within t he device to the erased state of all 1s (FFh). A \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          23  Write Enable instruction must be executed before th e device will accept the Chip Erase \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1).  The instruction is initiated by driving the CS# \npin low and shifting the instruction code “C7h” or “60h”. The Chip Erase instruction sequence is \nshown in Figure 18. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bi t has been latched. If this is not done the Chip \nErase instruction will not be executed. After CS# i s driven high, the self-timed Chip Erase \ninstruction will commence for a time duration of t CE  (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). \nWhile the Chip Erase cycle is in progress, the Read  Status Register instruction may still be \naccessed to check the status of the WIP bit. The WI P bit is a 1 during the Chip Erase cycle and \nbecomes a 0 when finished and the device is ready t o accept other instructions again. After the \nChip Erase cycle has finished the Write Enable Latc h (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared \nto 0. The Chip Erase instruction will not be execut ed if any page is protected by the Block Protect \n(BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits. \n \nFigure 18 Chip Erase Instruction \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          24  11.17. Power-down (B9h) \nAlthough the standby current during normal operatio n is relatively low, standby current can be \nfurther reduced with the Power-down instruction. Th e lower power consumption makes the \nPower-down instruction especially useful for batter y powered applications (See I CC1  and I CC2  in \n“12.4 DC Electrical Characteristics”). The instruct ion is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in Fig ure 19. \n \nThe CS# pin must be driven high after the eighth bi t has been latched. If this is not done the \nPower-down instruction will not be executed. After CS# is driven high, the power-down state will \nenter within the time duration of t DP  (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”). While in the power-\ndown state only the Release from Power- down / Devi ce ID instruction, which restores the device \nto normal operation, will be recognized. All other instructions are ignored. This includes the Read \nStatus Register instruction, which is always availa ble during normal operation. Ignoring all but \none instruction makes the Power Down state a useful  condition for securing maximum write \nprotection. The device always powers-up in the norm al operation with the standby current of I CC1 . \n \nFigure 19 Deep Power-down Instruction  \n \n11.18. Release Power-down / Device ID (ABh) \nThe Release from Power-down / Device ID instruction  is a multi-purpose instruction. It can be \nused to release the device from the power-down stat e, or obtain the devices electronic \nidentification (ID) number. \n \nTo release the device from the power-down state, th e instruction is issued by driving the CS# pin \nlow, shifting the instruction code “ABh” and drivin g CS# high as shown in Figure 20. Release from \npower-down will take the time duration of t RES1  (See “12.6 AC Electrical Characteristics”) before \nthe device will resume normal operation and other i nstructions are accepted. The CS# pin must \nremain high during the t RES1  time duration. \n \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in  the power-down state, the instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting t he instruction code “ABh” followed by 3-dummy \nbytes. The Device ID bits are then shifted out on t he falling edge of CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) first as shown in Figure 20. The Device ID va lue for the FM25F005 is listed in Table 3 \nManufacturer and Device Identification table. The D evice ID can be read continuously. The \ninstruction is completed by driving CS# high. \n \nWhen used to release the device from the power-down  state and obtain the Device ID, the \ninstruction is the same as previously described, an d shown in Figure 21, except that after CS# is \ndriven high it must remain high for a time duration  of t RES2  (See “12.6 AC Electrical \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          25  Characteristics”). After this time duration the dev ice will resume normal operation and other \ninstructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power-down / Device ID instruction is issued \nwhile an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in proces s (when WIP equals 1) the instruction is \nignored and will not have any effect on the current  cycle. \n \nFigure 20 Release Power-down Instruction  \n \n \nFigure 21 Release Power-down / Device ID Instructio n  \n \n11.19. Read Manufacturer / Device ID (90h) \nThe Read Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is an a lternative to the Release from Power-down / \nDevice ID instruction that provides both the JEDEC assigned manufacturer ID and the specific \ndevice ID. \n \nThe Read Manufacturer/Device ID instruction is very  similar to the Release from Power-down / \nDevice ID instruction. The instruction is initiated  by driving the CS# pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “90h” followed by a 24-bit address  A23-A0 of 000000h. After which, the \nManufacturer ID for Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics  Group Co., Ltd (A1h) and the Device ID \nare shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with mos t significant bit (MSB) first as shown in Figure \n22. The Device ID value for the FM25F005 is listed in Table 3 Manufacturer and Device \nIdentification table. If the 24-bit address is init ially set to 000001h the Device ID will be read fir st \nand then followed by the Manufacturer ID. The Manuf acturer and Device IDs can be read \ncontinuously, alternating from one to the other. Th e instruction is completed by driving CS# high. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          26  \n \nFigure 22 Read Manufacturer / Device ID Instruction   \n \n11.20. Read Unique ID Number(4Bh) \nThe Read Unique ID Number instruction accesses a fa ctory-set read-only 64-bit number that is \nunique to each FM25F005 device. The ID number can b e used in conjunction with user software \nmethods to help prevent copying or cloning of a sys tem. The Read Unique ID instruction is \ninitiated by driving the CS# pin low and shifting t he instruction code “4Bh” followed by a four bytes \nof dummy clocks. After which, the 64- bit ID is shi fted out on the falling edge of CLK as shown in \nFigure 23. \n \n                     Datasheet  \nFM25F005 512K-BIT SERIAL FLASH MEMORY             V er. 1.4                                                          27  \n100 101 102\n \nFigure 23 Read Unique ID Number Instruction (SPI Mo de only) \n \n11.21. Read JEDEC ID (9Fh) \nFor compatibility reasons, the FM25F005 provides se veral instructions to electronically determine \nthe identity of the device. The Read JEDEC ID instr uction is compatible with the JEDEC standard \nfor SPI compatible serial memories. The instruction  is initiated by driving the CS# pin low and \nshifting the instruction code “9Fh”. The JEDEC assi gned Manufacturer ID byte for Shanghai \nFudan Microelectronics Group Co., Ltd (A1h) and two  Device ID bytes, Memory Type (ID15-ID8) \nand Capacity ID7-ID0 are then shifted out on the fa lling edge of CLK with most significant bit \n(MSB) first as shown in Figure 24.
