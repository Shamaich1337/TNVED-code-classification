The\noutput voltage drop when aload isadded isdetermined bytheparasitic resistance (Rds(on) oftheMOSFET\nswitches and theESR ofthecapacitors) and thecharge transfer loss between capacitors.

#### Description:
The LM2664 is a CMOS charge-pump voltage converter designed to invert a positive voltage in the range of 1.8V to 5.5V to a corresponding negative voltage of -1.8V to -5.5V. It utilizes two external capacitors to achieve this voltage conversion, providing up to 40 mA of output current. The device operates at a frequency of 160 kHz, which helps to minimize output resistance and voltage ripple. The LM2664 is particularly suited for applications where low power consumption is critical, as it features a typical shutdown current of just 1 µA.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Cellular Phones:** Used to generate negative voltages required for certain components.
- **Pagers:** Provides necessary voltage inversion for operation.
- **PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants):** Supplies negative voltage for various internal circuits.
- **Operational Amplifier Power Supplies:** Can be used to create dual supply voltages.
- **Interface Power Supplies:** Powers interface circuits that require negative voltage.
- **Handheld Instruments:** Ideal for battery-operated devices needing efficient voltage conversion.

The LM2664 is an efficient solution for applications requiring a negative voltage supply, particularly in portable and battery-powered devices where power efficiency is paramount.
