All rights reserved.  \n26.Jun.2012 Rev.001 \n31kΩ 2kΩ 27kΩ CTL Refer to the above and implement proper thermal designs so that the IC will not be used under excessive power dissipation \nconditions under the entire operating temperature range. \nThe power consumption Pc of the IC in the event of shorting (i.e. the Vo and G ND pins are shorted) can be obtained from \nthe following equation:  \nPc = Vcc × (Icca + Ishort) (Ishort: short current). \n \n●Peripheral Circuit Considerations \n• Vcc pin \nInsert a capacitor (0.33 μF approx.) between V CC and GND. \nThe capacitance will vary depending on the application. Use a suitable capacitance and implement designs with  \nsufficient margins. \n \n• GND pin \nVerify that there is no potential difference betwe en the ground of the application board and the IC. \nIf there is a potential difference, the set voltage will not be output accurately, resulting in unstable IC operation. \nTherefore, lower the impedance by designing the ground pattern as wide and as short as possible. \n \n• CTL terminal \nThe CTL terminal turns on at an operating power supply voltage of 2.0 V or hi gher and turns off at 0.8 V \nor lower. There is no particular order when turning the power \nsupply and CTL terminals on or off. \n \n \nFig.20 Input Equivalent Circuit \n●Vo Terminal \nInsert a capacitor between the Vo and GND pins  in order to prevent output oscillation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFig.21 Output Equivalent Circuit Fig.22 ESR vs. I\nO (22μF) \n \nThe capacitance may vary greatly with temperature changes, t hus making it impossible to completely prevent oscillation. \nTherefore, use a tantalum aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a low ESR (Equivalent Serial Resistance). The output will \noscillate if the ESR is too high or too low, so refer to the ESR characterist ics in Fig.22 and operate the IC within the stable  \nregion. Use a capacitor within a capacitance between 22 μF and 1,000μ F. \nBelow figure, it is ESR-to-Io stabilit y Area characteristics, measured by 22 μＦ-ceramic-capacitor and resistor connected in series. \nThis characteristic is not equal value perfectly to 22µ Ｆ-aluminum electrolytic capacitor in order to measurement method. \nNote, however, that the stable range suggested in the figure depends on the IC and the resistance load involved, and can \nvary with the board’s wiring impedance, input impedance, and/or  load impedance. Therefore, be certain to ascertain the \nfinal status of these items for actual use.  \nKeep capacitor capacitance within a range of 22µF to 1000 μF. It is also recommended that a 0.33μ F bypass capacitor be \nconnected as close to the input pin-GND as location possible. However, in situations  such as rapid fluctuation of the input \nvoltage or the load, please check the operation in re al application to determine proper capacitance.  \nOUT \n22 μF IC \n200 400 600 800 1000 00.050.0750.10.20.51.02.0\nIo [mA] ESR [Ω ] \nOscillation re gion Oscillation region \nStable region 10.0\n \n10/16  BAxxBC0 Series  BAxxBC0W Series  BA00BC0WCP-V5  Datasheet\nTSZ02201-0R6R0A600120-1-2\nTSZ22111･ 15･001 www.rohm.com  \n© 2012 ROHM Co., Ltd. All rights reserved.  \n26.Jun.2012 Rev.001●Operational Notes \n1. Absolute maximum ratings \nAn excess in the absolute maximum ratings , such as supply voltage, temperature r ange of operating conditions, etc., can break \ndown the devices, thus making impossible to  identify breaking mode, such as a short circuit or an open circuit. If any over rated \nvalues will expect to exceed the absolut e maximum ratings, consider adding circuit protection devices, such as fuses. \n \n2. GND voltage \nThe potential of GND pin must be minimu m potential in all operating conditions. \n \n3. Thermal design \nUse a thermal design that allows for a sufficient margin in  light of the power dissipation  (Pd) in actual operating \nconditions. \n \n4. Inter-pin shorts and mounting errors \nUse caution when positioning the IC for mounting on printed circuit boards.  \nThe IC may be damaged if there is any connecti on error or if pins are shorted together. \n \n5. Actions in strong electromagnetic field \nUse caution when using the IC in the presence of a strong electromagnetic field as doing so may cause the IC to malfunction. \n \n6. Testing on application boards  \nWhen testing the IC on an application board,  connecting a capacitor to a pin with low impedance subjects the IC to stress. \nAlways discharge capacitors after each process or step. Always turn the IC's power supply off before connecting it to or \nremoving it from a jig or fixture during the inspection pr ocess. Ground the IC during assembly steps as an antistatic \nmeasure. Use similar precaution wh en transporting or storing the IC. \n \n7. Regarding input pin of the IC \nThis monolithic IC contains P+ isolation and P substrat e layers between adjacent elements in order to keep them \nisolated. \nP-N junctions are formed at the intersection of these P layers with the N layers of other elements, creating a parasitic \ndiode or transistor. For example, the relation between each potential is as follows: \nWhen GND > PIN A and GND > PIN B, the P-N j unction operates as a parasitic diode. \nWhen GND > PIN B, the P-N junction operates as a parasitic transistor. \nParasitic diodes can occur inevitable in the structure of th e IC. The operation of parasitic diodes can result in mutual \ninterference among circuits, operational faults, or physical damage. Accordingly, methods by which parasitic diodes \noperate, such as applying a voltage that is  lower than the GND (P substrate) voltage to an input pin, should not be used. \n \n8. Ground Wiring Pattern \nWhen using both small signal and large current GND pattern s, it is recommended to isolate the two ground patterns, \nplacing a single ground point at the gr ound potential of applicatio n so that the pattern wiring resistance and voltage \nvariations caused by large currents do not cause variations in  the small signal ground voltage. Be careful not to change \nthe GND wiring pattern of any external components, either. \n \n9. Thermal shutdown circuit \nThe IC incorporates a built-in thermal shutdown circuit (TSD circuit). The thermal shutdown circuit (TSD circuit) is designed \nonly to shut the IC off to prevent thermal runaway. It is not designed to protect the IC or guarantee its operation. Do not con tinue \nto use the IC after operating this circuit or use the IC in an environment where the operation of this circuit is assumed. \n \n10. Overcurrent Protection Circuit \nAn overcurrent protection circuit is incorporated in order to  prevention destruction due to short-time overload currents. \nContinued use of the protection circuits should be avoided. Pl ease note that the current increases negatively impact the temper ature. \n \n11. Damage to the internal circuit or element may occur when the polarity of the Vcc pin is opposit e to that of the other pins in  \napplications. (I.e. Vcc is shorted with the GND pin while an external capacitor is charged.) Use a maximum capacitance \nof 1000μ F for the output pins. Inserting a di ode to prevent back-current flow in series with Vcc or bypass diodes \nbetween Vcc and each pin is recommended. \n \n11/16  BAxxBC0 Series  BAxxBC0W Series  BA00BC0WCP-V5  Datasheet\nTSZ02201-0R6R0A600120-1-2\nTSZ22111･ 15･001 www.rohm.com  \n© 2012 ROHM Co., Ltd.
