These drivers are independently con-trolled, and their 35ns (typ) propagation delay, from inputto output, are matched to within 2ns (typ). The high-volt-age operation with very low and matched propagationdelay between drivers, and high source-/sink-currentcapabilities in a thermally enhanced package makethese devices suitable for high-power, high-frequencytelecom power converters. The 125V maximum inputvoltage provides plenty of margin over the 100V inputtransient requirement of telecom standards. A reliableon-chip bootstrap diode connected between V\nDDand\nBST eliminates the need for an external discrete diode.\nThe MAX15018A/MAX15019A both offer noninverting dri-\nvers. The MAX15018B/MAX15019B offer a noninvertinghigh-side driver and an inverting low-side driver (see the\nSelector Guide .) The MAX15018_ feature CMOS (V DD/2)\nlogic inputs. The MAX15019_ feature TTL-logic inputs.The drivers are available in the industry-standard 8-pinSO footprint and pin configuration with a thermallyenhanced 8-pin SO package.

These drivers oper-ate with an IC supply voltage of 8V to 12.6V, and con-sume only 2.75mA of supply current during typicalswitching operations. The MAX15018_/MAX15019_ pro-vide 3A (typ) sink/source peak current per output andare capable of operating with large capacitive loadsand with switching frequencies near 1MHz.\nThese drivers are intended to be used to drive the\nhigh-side MOSFET without requiring an isolation devicesuch as an optocoupler or a drive transformer. Thehigh-side driver is controlled by a TTL/CMOS logic sig-nal referenced to ground and is powered by a boot-strap circuit formed by an integrated diode and anexternal capacitor. Undervoltage lockout (UVLO) pro-tection is provided for both the high- and low-side dri-ver supplies (BST and V\nDD) and includes a UVLO\nhysteresis of 0.5V (typ).\nThe drivers are independently controlled and feature\nexceptionally fast switching times, very short propaga-tion delays (35ns typ), and matched propagation delay-times (2ns typ) between drivers, making them ideallysuited for high-frequency applications. Internal logic cir-cuitry prevents shoot-through during output statechanges and minimizes package power dissipation.\nThese devices are available with CMOS (V\nDD/2) or TTL\nlogic-level inputs. The MAX15018A/MAX15018B acceptCMOS input logic levels, while the MAX15019A/MAX15019B accept TTL input logic levels. For both ver-sions, the logic inputs are protected against voltagespikes up to +15V, regardless of V\nDD. See the Driver\nLogic Inputs (IN_H, IN_L) section.\nThe MAX15018_/MAX15019_ are available with both\nhigh-side and low-side noninverting logic inputs or withnoninverting high-side and inverting low-side logic inputs.See the \nFunctional Diagrams and Selector Guide . The\nMAX15018A and MAX15019A are pin-for-pin replace-ments for the HIP2100IB and HIP2101IB, respectively.The MAX15018_/MAX15019_ are available in a space-\nsaving, high-power, 8-pin SO-EP package that can dissi-pate up to 1.95W at +70°C. All devices operate over the-40°C to +125°C automotive temperature range.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nBoth the high- and low-side drivers feature separateUVLO protection that monitors each driver’s input sup-ply voltage (BST and V\nDD). The low-side driver UVLO\nthreshold (V DD_UVLO ) is referenced to GND and pulls\nboth driver outputs low when V DDfalls below 7.3V (typ).\nThe high-side driver UVLO threshold (V BST_UVLO ) is ref-\nerenced to HS, and only pulls DH low when V BSTfalls\nbelow 6.9V (typ) with respect to HS. After the IC is firstenergized, and once V\nDDrises above its UVLO thresh-\nold, DL starts switching and either follows the IN_L logicinput (MAX15018A/MAX15019A) or is inverted with refer-ence to the IN_L logic input (MAX15018B/MAX15019B). At this time, the bootstrap capacitor is notcharged, and DH does not switch since the BST-to-HSvoltage is below V\nBST_UVLO . Within a short time follow-\ning engagement of low-side switching, C BSTcharges\nthrough V DDand causes V BSTto exceed V BST_UVLO .\nDH then starts switching and follows IN_H. For synchro-nous buck and half-bridge converter topologies, thebootstrap capacitor can charge up in one cycle. Normaloperation then begins in a few microseconds after theBST-to-HS voltage exceeds V\nBST_UVLO . In the two-\nswitch forward topology, C BSTtakes more time (a few\nhundred microseconds) to charge and increase its volt-age above V\nBST_UVLO . The typical hysteresis for both\nUVLO thresholds is 0.5V. The bootstrap capacitor valueshould be selected carefully to avoid oscillations duringturn-on and turn-off at the DH output. Choose a capaci-tor value 20 times greater than the total gate capaci-tance of the MOSFET. Use a low ESR-type X7Rdielectric ceramic capacitor at BST (typically a 0.1µFceramic is adequate) and a parallel combination of 1µFand 0.1µF ceramic capacitors from V\nDD to GND. The\nhigh-side MOSFET’s continuous on-time is limited dueto the charge loss from the high-side driver’s quiescentcurrent. The maximum on-time is dependent on the sizeof C\nBST, IBST(190µA, max), and V BST_UVLO .\nOutput Driver\nThe MAX15018_/MAX15019_ drivers contain low on-\nresistance p-channel and n-channel devices in a totempole configuration for the driver output stage. Thisallows for rapid turn-on and turn-off of high gate-charge(Q\ng) external switching MOSFETs.\nThe drivers exhibit low drain-to-source resistance\n(RDS_ON ), which decreases for higher values of V DD\nand for lower operating temperatures. Lower R DS_ON\nmeans higher source and sink currents from the IC,and results in faster switching speeds, since the exter-nal MOSFET gate capacitance will charge and dis-charge at a quicker rate. The peak source and sinkcurrent provided by the drivers is typically 3A.\nPropagation delay from the logic inputs to the driver\noutputs is matched to within 8ns (max) between thelow-side and high-side drivers. Turn-on and turn-offpropagation delays are typically 35ns and 36ns. SeeFigure 1. The internal drivers also contain break-before-make logic to eliminate shoot-through conditions thatwould cause unnecessarily high operating supply cur-rents, efficiency reduction, and voltage spikes at V\nDD.\nVoltage at DL is approximately equal to V DDwhen in a\nhigh state, and zero when in a low state. Voltage fromDH to HS is approximately equal to V DDminus the\ndiode drop of the integrated bootstrap diode when in ahigh state, and zero when in a low state. The high-sideMOSFET’s continuous on-time is limited due to thecharge loss from the high-side driver’s quiescent cur-rent. The maximum on-time is dependent on the size ofthe bootstrap capacitor (C\nBST), IBST(190µA max), and\nVBST_UVLO .\nIntegrated Bootstrap Diode\nAn integrated diode between V DDand BST is used in\nconjunction with an external bootstrap capacitor (C BST)\nto provide the voltage required to turn on the high-sideMOSFET (see the \nTypical Operating Circuit ). The inter-\nnal diode charges the bootstrap capacitor from V DD\nwhen the low-side switch is on, and isolates V DDwhen\nHS is pulled high when the high-side driver turns on.The internal bootstrap diode has a typical forward volt-age drop of 0.9V and has a 40ns (typ) turn-off/-on time.The turn-off time (reverse recovery time) depends onthe reverse-recovery current and can be as low as10ns. If a lower diode voltage-drop between V\nDDand\nBST is needed, connect an external Schottky diodebetween V\nDDand BST.\nMAX15018/MAX15019125V/3A, High-Speed, \nHalf-Bridge MOSFET Drivers\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 9Figure 1.

Thebootstrap capacitor value should be selected carefullyto avoid oscillations during turn-on and turn-off at theDH output. Choose a capacitor value approximately 20times greater than the total gate capacitance of theMOSFET being switched. Use a low-ESR, X7R-typedielectric ceramic capacitor (typically a 0.1µF ceramicis adequate). The high-side MOSFET’s continuous on-time is limited due to the charge loss from the high-sidedriver’s quiescent current. The maximum on-time isdependent on the size of C\nBST, IBST(190µA max), and\nVBST_UVLO. Note that the bootstrap capacitor requires\ntime to charge up to V DD, according to the time con-\nstant of the charging loop through the lower MOSFET(see the \nTypical Operating Circuit ). Ensure that the\nlower MOSFET is on for at least the minimum timerequired to charge C\nBST.\nDriver Logic Inputs (IN_H, IN_L)\nThe MAX15018_ are CMOS (V DD/2) logic-input drivers,\nand the MAX15019_ are TTL-compatible logic-input dri-vers. The required logic-input levels are independent ofV\nDD. For example, the IC can be powered by a 10V sup-\nply while the logic inputs are provided from 12V CMOSlogic. Additionally, the logic inputs are protected againstvoltage spikes up to 15V, regardless of V\nDDvoltage. The\nTTL and CMOS logic inputs have 400mV and 1.6V hys-teresis, respectively, to avoid double pulsing during sig-nal transition. The logic inputs are high-impedance pins(500kΩtyp) and should not be left unconnected to\nensure the input logic state is at a known level. With thelogic inputs unconnected, the DH and DL outputs pulllow as V\nDDrises up above the UVLO threshold. The\nPWM output from the controller must assume a properstate while powering up the device.\nApplications Information\nSupply Bypassing and Grounding\nCareful attention is required when choosing the bypass-ing and grounding scheme of the MAX15018_/MAX15019_. Peak supply and output currents mayexceed 6A when both drivers are simultaneously driving\nlarge external capacitive loads in phase. Supply dropsand ground shifts create forms of negative feedback forinverterting topologies and may degrade the delay andtransition times. Ground shifts due to insufficient devicegrounding may also disturb other circuits sharing thesame AC ground return path. Any series inductance inthe V\nDD, DH, DL, and/or GND paths can cause oscilla-\ntions due to the very high di/dt when switching theMAX15018_/MAX15019_ with any capacitive load. Placeone or more 0.1µF ceramic capacitors in parallel fromV\nDDto GND as close as possible to the device to\nbypass the input supply. Use a ground plane to minimizeground return resistance and series inductance. Placethe external MOSFETs as close as possible to theMAX15018_/MAX15019_ to reduce trace length and fur-ther minimize board inductance and AC path resistance.\nPower Dissipation\nPower dissipation in the MAX15018_/MAX15019_ is pri-marily due to power loss in the internal boost diode andthe internal nMOS and pMOS FETS. For capacitiveloads, the total power dissipation for the device is:\nP\nD= (C Lx VDD2x fSW) + (I VDDO + IBSTO ) x V DD\nwhere C Lis the combined capacitive load at DH and\nDL, V DDis the supply voltage, and f SWis the switching\nfrequency of the IC. P Dincludes the power dissipated in\nthe internal bootstrap diode (P DIODE ). The internal\npower dissipation reduces by P DIODE , if an external\nbootstrap Schottky diode is used. The power dissipationin the internal boost diode (when driving a capacitiveload) will be the charge through the diode per switchingperiod multiplied by the maximum diode forward voltagedrop (V\nF= 1V) as given in the following equation.\nPDIODE = CDHx (VDD- 1) x f SW x VF\nwhere C DHis the capacitive load at DH, V DDis the sup-\nply voltage, f SWis the switching frequency of the con-\nverter, V Fis the maximum diode forward voltage drop.\nThe total power dissipation when using the internal\nboost diode will be P Dand, when using an external\nSchottky diode, will be P D- PDIODE . The total power\ndissipated in the device must be kept below the maxi-mum of 1.95W for the 8-pin SO with exposed pad at T\nA\n= +70°C ambient.125V/3A, High-Speed, \nHalf-Bridge MOSFET Drivers\n10 ______________________________________________________________________________________\nLayout Information\nThe MAX15018_/MAX15019_ drivers source and sink\nlarge currents to create very fast rise and fall edges atthe gates of the switching MOSFETs. The high di/dt cancause unacceptable ringing if the trace lengths andimpedances are not well controlled. Use the followingPCB layout guidelines when designing with theMAX15018_/MAX15019_:\n• It is important that the V\nDDvoltage (with respect to\nground) or BST voltage (with respect to HS) does notexceed 15V. Voltage spikes higher than 15V fromV\nDDto GND or from BST to HS can damage the\ndevice. Place one or more low-ESL 0.1µF decouplingceramic capacitors from V\nDDto GND and from BST\nto HS as close as possible to the part. The ceramicdecoupling capacitors should be at least 20 timesthe gate capacitance being driven.\n• There are two AC current loops formed between the\nIC and the gate of the MOSFET being driven. TheMOSFET looks like a large capacitance from gate to\nsource when the gate is being pulled low. The activecurrent loop is from the MOSFET driver output (DL orDH) to the MOSFET gate, to the MOSFET source, andto the return terminal of the MOSFET driver (eitherGND or HS). When the gate of the MOSFET is beingpulled high, the active current loop is from the MOS-FET driver output, (DL or DH), to the MOSFET gate, tothe MOSFET source, to the return terminal of the dri-vers decoupling capacitor, to the positive terminal ofthe decoupling capacitor, and to the supply connec-tion of the MOSFET driver. The decoupling capacitorwill be either C\nBSTfor the high-side MOSFET or the\nVDD decoupling capacitor for the low-side MOSFET.\nCare must be taken to minimize the physical distanceand the impedance of these AC current paths.\n• Solder the exposed pad of the 8-pin SO-EP package\nto a large copper plane to achieve the rated powerdissipation.\nMAX15018/MAX15019125V/3A, High-Speed, \nHalf-Bridge MOSFET Drivers\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 11Typical Application Circuits\nMAX15018APWM1\nPWM2IN_H\nIN_LN\nVOUT\nN\nGNDVDD BST\nDH\nDLHS\nN\nNVDD = 8V TO 12.6V V IN = 0 TO 125V\nFigure 2.
