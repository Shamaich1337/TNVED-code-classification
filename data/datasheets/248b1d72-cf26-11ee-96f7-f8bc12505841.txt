Fast switching speed, coupled with high signal bandwidth, makes the parts suitable for video signal \nswitching. CMOS construction ensures ultralow power dissipa-\ntion, making the parts ideally suited for portable and battery-powered instruments. \nThe ADG451/ADG452/ADG453 contain four independent, \nsingle-pole/single-throw (SPST) switches. The ADG451 and ADG452 differ only in that the digital control logic is inverted. The ADG451 switches are turned on with a logic low on the appropriate \ncontrol input, while a logic high is required for the ADG452.

ADG453 \nThe ADG453 has two switches with digital control logic similar \nto that of the ADG451, while the logic is inverted on the other \ntwo switches. \nEach switch conducts equally well  in both directions when on, \nand each has an input signal range that extends to the supplies. \nIn the off condition, signal levels up to the supplies are blocked. \nThe ADG453 exhibits break-before-make switching action for use in multiplexer applications. Inherent in the design is low \ncharge injection for minimum transients when switching the \ndigital inputs.\n \nADG451/ADG452/ADG453  \n \nRev.

Extended Signal Range. \nThe ADG451/ADG452/ADG453 are fabricated on an enhanced \nLC2MOS process, giving an increased signal range that fully \nextends to the supply rails. \n4. Break-Before-Make Switching. \nThis prevents channel shorting when the switches are \nconfigured as a multiplexer (ADG453 only.) 5. Single-Supply Operation. \nFor applications in which the analog signal is unipolar, the \nADG451/ADG452/ADG453 can be operated from a single \nrail power supply. The parts are fully specified with a single 12 V power supply and remain functional with single supplies \nas low as 5.0 V . \n6. Dual-Supply Operation. \nFor applications where the analog signal is bipolar, the \nADG451/ADG452/ADG453 can be operated from a dual \npower supply ranging from ±4.5 V to ±20 V . \n \nADG451/ADG452/ADG453  \n \nRev.

Fast, Accurate Sample-and-Hold Circuit Due to switch and capacitor leakage, the voltage on the hold \ncapacitor decreases with time. The ADG451/ADG452/ADG453 \nminimize this droop due to their low leakage specifications. The \ndroop rate is further minimized by the use of a polystyrene hold capacitor. The droop rate for the circuit shown is typically \n30 μV/μs. \nA second switch, SW2, which operates in parallel with SW1, is \nincluded in this circuit to reduce pedestal error. Because both \nswitches are at the same potential, they have a differential effect \non the op amp, AD711 , which minimizes charge injection \neffects. Pedestal error is also reduced by the compensation \nnetwork, R C and C C. This compensation network reduces the \nhold time glitch while optimizing the acquisition time. Using the illustrated op amps and component values, the pedestal error has a maximum value of 5 mV over the ±10 V input range. Both the acquisition and settling times are 850 ns. \n \n \n  ADG451/ADG452/ADG453\n \nRev. C | Page 13 of 16 TEST CIRCUITS\nSD\nRON=V1/IDSVSV1IDS\n05239-014 \nFigure 16.
