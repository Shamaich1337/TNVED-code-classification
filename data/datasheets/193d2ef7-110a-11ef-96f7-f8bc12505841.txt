In sleep mode, which is enabled by applying a low TTL or CMOS level to the SLEEP\n pin, the output is turned off and supply current is \nfurther reduced to less than 15 μA. \nThe REF19x series references are specified over the extended \nindustrial temperature range (−40°C to +85°C) with typical performance specifications over −40°C to +125°C for applications, such as automotive. \nAll electrical grades are available in an 8-lead SOIC package; the \nPDIP and TSSOP packages are available only in the lowest \nelectrical grade.  TEST PINS \nTest Pin 1 and Test Pin 5 are reserved for in-package Zener zap. \nTo achieve the highest level of accuracy at the output, the Zener \nzapping technique is used to trim the output voltage. Because each unit may require a different amount of adjustment, the resistance value at the test pins varies widely from pin to pin and from part to part. The user should leave Pin 1 and Pin 5 unconnected. \nREF19x\nSERIES\nTOP VIEW\n(Not to Scale)TP 1\nVS2\nSLEEP 3\nGND 4NC\nNCOUTPUTTP8\n765\n00371-001NOTES\n1. NC = NO CONNECT.\n2.

In the event of \nan accidental short-circuit condition, the reference device shuts \ndown and limits its supply current to 40 mA. \nVS\nOUTPUT\nSLEEP (SHUTDOWN)\nGND\n00371-020 \nFigure 20. Simpli fied Schematic \nDEVICE POWER DISSIPATION CONSIDERATIONS \nThe REF19x family of references is capable of delivering load \ncurrents to 30 mA with an input voltage that ranges from 3.3 V \nto 15 V . When these devices are used in applications with large input voltages, exercise care to avoid exceeding the maximum internal power dissipation of these devices. Exceeding the \npublished specifications for maximum power dissipation or \njunction temperature can result in premature device failure.  The following formula should be used to calculate the maximum \njunction temperature or dissipation of the device: \nJAA J\nDT TPθ−=  \nwhere TJ and TA are the junction and ambient temperatures, \nrespectively; PD is the device power dissipation; and θ JA is the \ndevice package thermal resistance. \nOUTPUT VOLTAGE BYPASSING \nFor stable operation, low dropout voltage regulators and references \ngenerally require a bypass capacitor connected from their V OUT \npins to their GND pins. Although the REF19x family of references is \ncapable of stable operation with capacitive loads exceeding 100 μF, \na 1 μF capacitor is sufficient to guarantee rated performance. \nThe addition of a 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor in parallel with the bypass capacitor improves load current transient performance. For best line voltage transient performance, it is recommended that the voltage inputs of these devices be bypassed with a 10 μF electrolytic capacitor in parallel with a 0.1 μF ceramic capacitor. \n \n SLEEP MODE OPERATION \nAll REF19x devices include a sleep capability that is TTL/CMOS-\nlevel compatible. Internally, a pull-up current source to V S is \nconnected at the SLEEP  pin. This permits the SLEEP  pin to be \ndriven from an open collector/drain driver. A logic low or a 0 V \ncondition on the SLEEP  pin is required to turn off the output \nstage. During sleep, the output of the references becomes a high \nimpedance state where its potential would then be determined by external circuitry. If the sleep feature is not used, it is \nrecommended that the SLEEP\n pin be connected to V S (Pin 2). \nBASIC VOLTAGE REFERENCE CONNECTIONS \nThe circuit in Figure 21  illustrates the basic configuration for \nthe REF19x family of references. Note the 10 μF/0.1 μF bypass \nnetwork on the input and the 1 μF/0.1 μF bypass network on the output. It is recommended that no connections be made to \nPin 1, Pin 5, Pin 7, and Pin 8. If the sleep feature is not required, \nPin 3 should be connected to V\nS. \nNC\nNCVS\nSLEEPNC\nNCOUTPUT 0.1µF 10µFREF19x\nNC = NO CONNECT8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n41µF\nTANT0.1µF+\n00371-021 \nFigure 21. Basic Voltage Reference Connections \nMEMBRANE SWITCH-CONTROLLED POWER SUPPLY \nWith output load currents in the tens of mA, the REF19x family of \nreferences can operate as a low dropout power supply in hand-held \ninstrument applications. In the circuit shown in Figure 22 , a \nmembrane on/off switch is used to control the operation of the \nreference. During an initial power-on condition, the SLEEP  pin is \nheld to GND by the 10 kΩ resistor. Recall that this condition (read: \nthree-state) disables the REF19x output. When the membrane on \nswitch is pressed, the SLEEP  pin is momentarily pulled to V S, \nenabling the REF19x output. At this point, current through the 10 kΩ \nresistor is reduced and the internal current source connected to the \nSLEEP  pin takes control. Pin 3 assumes and remains at the same \npotential as V S. When the membrane off switch is pressed, the \nSLEEP  pin is momentarily connected to GND, which once \nagain disables the REF19x output. \nON\nOFF10kΩ1kΩ\n5%NC\nNCVSNC\nNCOUTPUTREF19x\nNC = NO CONNECT8\n7\n6\n51\n2\n3\n41µF\nTANT+\n00371-022 \nFigure 22.

Classification Profile (Not to Scale) \nSOLDER HEAT EFFECT \nThe mechanical stress and heat effect of soldering a part to a \nPCB can cause output voltage of a reference to shift in value. \nThe output voltage of REF195 shifts after the part undergoes the \nextreme heat of a lead-free soldering profile, like the one shown in Figure 23 . The materials that make up a semiconductor device \nand its package have different rates of expansion and contraction. The stress on the dice has changed position, causing shift on the \noutput voltage, after exposed to extreme soldering temperatures. \nThis shift is similar but more severe than thermal hysteresis. \nTypical result of soldering temperature effect on REF19x output \nvalue shift is shown in Figure 24 . It shows the output shift due \nto soldering and does not include mechanical stress. \n00371-1246\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n–0.16\n–0.14–0.12–0.10\n–0.08\n–0.06–0.04–0.02\n0\n0.020.040.060.08\n0.10\n0.12\n0.160.14NUMBER OF UNITS\nSHIFT DUE TO SOLDER HEAT EFFECT (%)  \nFigure 24.

Boosted 3.3 V Refere nced with Current Limiting \nIn this circuit, the power supply current of reference U1 flowing \nthrough R1 to R2 develops a base drive for Q1, whose collector \nprovides the bulk of the output current. With a typical gain of 100 in Q1 for 100 mA to 200 mA loads, U1 is never required to furnish \nmore than a few mA, so this factor minimizes temperature-related \ndrift. Short-circuit protection is provided by Q2, which clamps the drive to Q1 at about 300 mA of load current, with values as shown in Figure 25 . With this separation of control and power \nfunctions, dc stability is optimum, allowing most advantageous \nuse of premium grade REF19x devices for U1. Of course, load \nREF19x Series Data Sheet  \n \nRev. L | Page 22 of 28 management should still be exercised. A short, heavy, low dc \nresistance (DCR) conductor should be used from U1 to 6 to the V OUT \nSense Point S, where the collector of Q1 connects to the load, Point F. \nBecause of the current limiting configuration, the dropout voltage \ncircuit is raised about 1.1 V over that of the REF19x devices, due to the V\nBE of Q1 and the drop across Current Sense Resistor R4. \nHowever, overall dropout is typically still low enough to allow operation of a 5 V to 3.3 V regulator/reference using the REF196 for \nU1 as noted, with a V\nS as low as 4.5 V and a load current of 150 mA. \nThe requirement for a heat sink on Q1 depends on the maximum \ninput voltage and short-circuit current. With V S = 5 V and a \n300 mA current limit, the worst-case dissipation of Q1 is 1.5 W , less than the TO-220 package 2 W limit. However, if smaller TO-39 \nor TO-5 package devices, such as the 2N4033, are used, the current \nlimit should be reduced to keep maximum dissipation below \nthe package rating. This is accomplished by simply raising R4. \nA tantalum output capacitor is used at C1 for its low equivalent \nseries resistance (ESR), and the higher value is required for stability. Capacitor C2 provides input bypassing and can be an ordinary \nelectrolytic. \nShutdown control of the booster stage is an option, and when used, \nsome cautions are needed. Due to the additional active devices \nin the V\nS line to U1, a direct drive to Pin 3 does not work as with an \nunbuffered REF19x device. To enable shutdown control, the \nconnection from U1 to Q2 is broken at the X, and Diode D1 then allows a CMOS control source, V\nC, to drive U1 to 3 for on/off \noperation. Startup from shutdown is not as clean under heavy \nload as it is in basic REF19x series, and can require several \nmilliseconds under load. Nevertheless, it is still effective and can fully control 150 mA loads. When shutdown control is \nused, heavy capacitive loads should be minimized. \nNEGATIVE PRECISION REFERENCE WITHOUT \nPRECISION RESISTORS \nIn many current-output CMOS DAC applications where the output \nsignal voltage must be the same polarity as the reference voltage, it is often necessary to reconfigure a current-switching DAC into a voltage-switching DAC using a 1.25 V reference, an op amp, \nand a pair of resistors. Using a current-switching DAC directly \nrequires an additional operational amplifier at the output to reinvert the signal. A negative voltage reference is then desirable because an additional operational amplifier is not required for either reinversion (current-switching mode) or amplification \n(voltage-switching mode) of the DAC output voltage. In general, \nany positive voltage reference can be converted into a negative \nvoltage reference using an operational amplifier and a pair of matched resistors in an inverting configuration. The disadvantage to this approach is that the largest single source of error in the \ncircuit is the relative matching of the resistors used. \nThe circuit illustrated in Figure 26  avoids the need for tightly \nmatched resistors by using an active integrator circuit. In this \ncircuit, the output of the voltage reference provides the input \ndrive for the integrator. To maintain circuit equilibrium, the integrator adjusts its output to establish the proper relationship \nbetween the V\nOUT and GND references. Thus, any desired negative \noutput voltage can be selected by substituting for the appropriate reference IC. The sleep feature is maintained in the circuit with \nthe simple addition of a PNP transistor and a 10 kΩ resistor. \n100Ω\n1µF1kΩ1µF\n–VREFREF19xVS\nGNDOUTPUT\n100kΩSLEEP\nTTL/CMOS\nA1 = 1/2 OP295,\n1/2 OP291VS\n10kΩ\n2N3906\n3 62\n4SLEEP\n10kΩ+5V\n–5VA1\n00371-024 \nFigure 26. Negative Precision Voltage Reference Uses No Precision Resistors \nOne caveat to this approach is that although rail-to-rail output amplifiers work best in the application, these operational amplifiers \nrequire a finite amount (mV) of headroom when required to provide any load current; consider this issue when choosing the negative supply for the circuit. \nSTACKING REFERENCE ICs FOR ARBITRARY \nOUTPUTS \nSome applications may require two reference voltage sources that \nare a combined sum of standard outputs. The circuit in Figure 27  \nshows how this stacked output reference can be implemented. \nTwo reference ICs are used, fed from a common unregulated input, \nVS. The outputs of the individual ICs are connected in series, as \nshown in Figure 27 , which provide two output voltages, V OUT1 and \nVOUT2. V OUT1 is the terminal voltage of U1, whereas V OUT2 is the \nsum of this voltage and the terminal voltage of U2. U1 and U2 are chosen for the two voltages that supply the required outputs (see Table 1 ). If, for example, both U1 and U2 are REF192s, the \ntwo outputs are 2.5 V and 5.0 V . \nR1\n3.9kΩ\n(SEE TEXT)C1\n0.1µF+VS\nVS > VOUT2  + 0.15V\nVIN\nCOMMON\nVOUT\nCOMMONOUTPUT TABLE\nU1/U2\nREF192/REF192\nREF192/REF194REF192/REF195V\nOUT1  (V)\n2.52.52.5VOUT2 (V)\n5.07.07.5\n+VOUT2\nC21µF\nC3\n0.1µF+VOUT1\nC4\n1µFU2\nREF19x\n(SEE TABLE)2\n6 3\n4\nU1\nREF19x\n(SEE TABLE)2\n6 3\n4+\n+VO (U2)\nVO (U1)\n00371-025 \nFigure 27. Stacking Voltage References with the REF19x \n \n \nData Sheet   REF19x Series\n \nRev. L | Page 23 of 28 Although this concept is simple, some cautions are needed. Because \nthe lower reference circuit must sink a small bias current from U2 (50 μA to 100 μA), plus the base current from the series PNP output transistor in U2, either the external load of U1 or R1 must provide \na path for this current. If the U1 minimum load is not well defined, \nResistor R1 should be used, set to a value that conservatively passes 600 μA of current with the applicable V\nOUT1 across it. Note that the \ntwo U1 and U2 reference circuits are locally treated as macrocells, each having its own bypasses at input and output for best stability. \nBoth U1 and U2 in this circuit can source dc currents up to \ntheir full rating. The minimum input voltage, V\nS, is determined by \nthe sum of the outputs, V OUT2, plus the dropout voltage of U2. \nA related variation on stacking two 3-terminal references is shown \nin Figure 28 , where U1, a REF192, is stacked with a 2-terminal \nreference diode, such as the AD589. Like the 3-terminal stacked \nreference shown in Figure 27 , this circuit provides two outputs, \nVOUT1 and V OUT2, which are the individual terminal voltages of D1 \nand U1, respectively. Here this is 1.235 V and 2.5 V , which provides a \nVOUT2 of 3.735 V . When using 2-terminal reference diodes, such as \nD1, the rated minimum and maximum device currents must be \nobserved, and the maximum load current from V OUT1 can be no \ngreater than the current setup by R1 and V O (U1). When V O \n(U1) is equal to 2.5 V , R1 provides a 500 μA bias to D1, so the maximum load current available at V\nOUT1 is 450 μA or less. \nD1\nAD589R1\n4.99kΩ\n(SEE TEXT)C1\n0.1μF+VS\nVS> VOUT2  + 0.15V\nVIN\nCOMMON\nVOUT\nCOMMON+VOUT2\n3.735V\nC2\n1μF\n+VOUT1\n1.235VC31μFU1\nREF1922\n6 3\n4+\n+VO (U1)\nVO (D1)\n00371-026 \nFigure 28.

As \nshown in Figure 29 , any one of the devices in the REF19x family \nof references can be configured as a precision current source. \nThe circuit configuration illustrated is a floating current source \nwith a grounded load. The output voltage of the reference is \nbootstrapped across R SET, which sets the output current into the \nload. With this configuration, circuit precision is maintained for \nload currents in the range from the reference’s supply current \n(typically 30 μA) to approximately 30 mA. The low dropout \nvoltage of these devices maximizes the current source’s output \nvoltage compliance without excess headroom.

A Low Dropout, Precision Current Source \nSWITCHED OUTPUT 5 V/3.3 V REFERENCE \nApplications often require digital control of reference voltages, \nselecting between one stable voltage and a second. With the \nsleep feature inherent to the REF19x series, switched output reference configurations are easily implemented with little \nadditional hardware. \nThe circuit in Figure 30  shows the general technique, which takes \nadvantage of the output wire-OR capability of the REF19x device \nfamily. When off, a REF19x device is effectively an open circuit \nat the output node with respect to the power supply. When on, a REF19x device can source current up to its current rating, but sink only a few μA (essentially, just the relatively low current of the internal output scaling divider). Consequently, when two devices \nare wired together at their common outputs, the output voltage \nis the same as the output voltage for the on device. The off state device draws a small standby current of 15 μA (maximum), but otherwise does not interfere with operation of the on device, which can operate to its full current rating. Note that the two devices in \nthe circuit conveniently share both input and output capacitors, \nand with CMOS logic drive, it is power efficient. \nU3B\n74HC04U3A\n74HC04VCVOUT (V)\n5.0\n3.3\n4.5\n5.0VC*\nHIGHLOW\nHIGH\nLOWU1/U2\nREF195/\nREF196\nREF194/\nREF195\n*CMOS LOGIC LEVELS+VS = 6V\nVIN\nCOMMONVOUT\nCOMMONC1\n0.1µF+VOUT\nC21µFU1\nREF19x\n(SEE TABLE)2\n3\n4\nU2\nREF19x\n(SEE TABLE)2\n3\n4+6\n613 24OUTPUT T ABLE\n00371-028 \nFigure 30.

For example, with U1 (a REF195) and U2 (a REF196), as noted in the table in Figure 30 , changing the CMOS-compatible \nV\nC logic control voltage from high to low selects between a nominal \noutput of 5.0 V and 3.3 V , and vice versa. Other REF19x family units can also be used for U1/U2, with similar operation in a logic sense, but with outputs as per the individual paired devices (see the table in Figure 30 ). Of course, the exact output voltage \ntolerance, drift, and overall quality of the reference voltage is \nconsistent with the grade of individual U1 and U2 devices. Figure 31. Low Dropout, Kelvin-Connected Voltage Reference \nFAIL-SAFE 5 V REFERENCE \nSome critical applications require a reference voltage to be \nmaintained at a constant voltage, even with a loss of primary \npower. The low standby power of the REF19x series and the \nswitched output capability allow a fail-safe reference con-figuration to be implemented rather easily. This reference maintains a tight output voltage tolerance for either a primary power source (ac line derived) or a standby (battery derived) \npower source, automatically switching between the two as the \npower conditions change. Due to the nature of the wire-OR, one application caveat should be understood about this circuit. Because U1 and U2 can only source current effectively, negative going output voltage changes, which require the sinking of current, necessarily take longer than positive going changes. In practice, this means that the circuit is quite fast when undergoing a transition from 3.3 V to 5 V , but the \ntransition from 5 V to 3.3 V takes longer. Exactly how much \nlonger is a function of the load resistance, R\nL, seen at the output and \nthe typical 1 μF value of C2. In general, a conservative transition time is approximately several milliseconds for load resistances in the range of 100 Ω to 1 kΩ. Note that for highest accuracy at \nthe new output voltage, several time constants should be allowed \n(for example, >7.6 time constants for <1/2 LSB error @ 10 bits). The circuit in Figure 32  illustrates this concept, which borrows \nfrom the switched output idea of Figure 30 , again using the \nREF19x device family output wire-OR capability. In this case, \nbecause a constant 5 V reference voltage is desired for all condi-tions, two REF195 devices are used for U1 and U2, with their \non/off switching controlled by the presence or absence of the \nprimary dc supply source, V\nS. V BAT is a 6 V battery backup \nsource that supplies power to the load only when V S fails. For \nnormal (V S present) power conditions, V BAT sees only the 15 μA \n(maximum) standby current drain of U1 in its off state. KELVIN CONNECTIONS \nIn many portable applications where the PCB cost and area go \nhand-in-hand, circuit interconnects are very often narrow. These \nnarrow lines can cause large voltage drops if the voltage reference is required to provide load currents to various functions. The inter-connections of a circuit can exhibit a typical line resistance of 0.45 mΩ/square (for example, 1 oz. Cu). In operation, it is assumed that for all conditions, either U1 or U2 is on, and a 5 V reference output is available. With this \nvoltage constant, a scaled down version is applied to the \nComparator IC U3, providing a fixed 0.5 V input to the negative input for all power conditions. The R1 to R2 divider provides a signal to the U3 positive input proportionally to V\nS, which \nswitches U3 and U1/U2, dependent upon the absolute level of \nVS. In Figure 32 , Op Amp U3 is configured as a comparator \nwith hysteresis, which provides clean, noise-free output \nswitching. This hysteresis is important to eliminate rapid switching at the threshold due to V\nS ripple. Furthermore, the \ndevice chosen is the AD820, a rail-to-rail output device. This device provides high and low output states within a few mV of \nV\nS, ground for accurate thresholds, and compatible drive for U2 \nfor all V S conditions. R3 provides positive feedback for circuit \nhysteresis, changing the threshold at the positive input as a \nfunction of the output of U3. In applications where these devices are configured as low dropout \nvoltage regulators, these wiring voltage drops can become a large \nsource of error. To circumvent this problem, force and sense connections can be made to the reference through the use of an operational amplifier, as shown in Figure 31 . This method provides \na means by which the effects of wiring resistance voltage drops can \nbe eliminated. Load currents flowing through wiring resistance \nproduce an I-R error (I\nLOAD × R WIRE) at the load. However, the \nKelvin connection overcomes the problem by including the wiring resistance within the forcing loop of the op amp. Because the op amp senses the load voltage, op amp loop control forces \nthe output to compensate for the wiring error and to produce \nthe correct voltage at the load. Depending on the reference device chosen, operational amplifiers that can be used in this application are the OP295, OP292, and OP183.  \n \nData Sheet   REF19x Series\n \nRev.

Fail-Safe 5 V Reference  \nFor V S levels lower than the lower threshold, the output of U3 is \nlow, thus U2 and Q1 are off and U1 is on. For V S levels higher \nthan the upper threshold, the situation reverses, with U1 off and \nboth U2 and Q1 on. In the interest of battery power conserva-\ntion, all of the comparison switching circuitry is powered from V\nS and is arranged so that when V S fails, the default output \ncomes from U1. \nFor the R1 to R3 values, as shown in Figure 32 , lower/upper V S \nswitching thresholds are approximately 5.5 V and 6 V , respec-\ntively. These can be changed to suit other V S supplies, as can the \nREF19x devices used for U1 and U2, over a range of 2.5 V to 5 V of output. U3 can operate down to a V\nS of 3.3 V , which is \ngenerally compatible with all REF19x family devices. \nLOW POWER, STRAIN GAGE CIRCUIT \nAs shown in Figure 33 , the REF19x family of references can be \nused in conjunction with low supply voltage operational ampli-fiers, such as the OP492 or the OP747, in a self-contained strain gage circuit in which the REF195 is used as the core. Other \nreferences can be easily accommodated by changing circuit \nelement values. The references play a dual role, first as the voltage regulator to provide the supply voltage requirements of the strain gage and the operational amplifiers, and second as a precision voltage reference for the current source used to stimulate the bridge. A distinct feature of the circuit is that it \ncan be remotely controlled on or off by digital means via \nthe SLEEP\n pin. 500Ω\n0.1%57kΩ\n1%0.1μF\n10kΩ\n1%0.1μF1/4\nOP49210μFREF195\n2.21kΩ\n20kΩ\n1%10kΩ\n1%\n20kΩ\n1%\n20kΩ\n1%20kΩ\n1%0.01μF10μF100Ω\nOUTPUT2N2222+1μF+6 2\n4\n+\n–14\n1123\n1/4\nOP492\n+–\n7\n561/4\nOP492\n+–\n14\n1213\n1/4\nOP492\n+–\n8\n10910kΩ\n1%\n00371-031 \nFigure 33.
