This pin-compatible, 8-/10-/12-/14-\nbit resolution family is optimized for low power operation, while\nmaintaining excellent dynamic performance. The AD9704/AD9705/\nAD9706/AD9707  family is pin-compatible with the AD9748 /AD9740 /\nAD9742 /AD9744  family of TxDAC converters and is specifically\noptimized for the transmit signal path of communication systems.\nAll of the devices share the same interface, LFCSP package, and\npinout, providing an upward or downward component selection path\nbased on performance, resolution, and cost. The AD9704/AD9705/\nAD9706/AD9707  offer exceptional ac and dc performance, while\nsupporting update rates up to 175 MSPS.\nThe flexible power supply operating range of 1.7 V to 3.6 V and low\npower dissipation of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  parts\nmake them well suited for portable and low power applications.\nPower dissipation of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  can be\nreduced to 15 mW, with a small trade-off in performance, by\nlowering the full-scale current output. In addition, a power-down\nmode reduces the standby power dissipation to approximately 2.2\nmW.\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  have an optional serial pe-\nripheral interface (SPI®) that provides a higher level of programma-\nbility to enhance performance of the DAC. An adjustable output,common-mode feature allows for easy interfacing to other compo-\nnents that require common modes from 0 V to 1.2 V.\nEdge-triggered input latches and a 1.0 V temperature-compensated\nband gap reference have been integrated to provide a complete,\nmonolithic DAC solution. The digital inputs support 1.8 V and 3.3 V\nCMOS logic families.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\n1.Pin Compatible. The AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  line of\nTxDAC converters is pin-compatible with the AD9748 /AD9740 /\nAD9742 /AD9744  TxDAC line (LFCSP package).\n2.Low Power. Complete CMOS DAC operates on a single supply\nof 3.6 V down to 1.7 V, consuming 50 mW (3.3 V) and 12 mW\n(1.8 V). The DAC full-scale current can be reduced for lower\npower operation. Sleep and power-down modes are provided\nfor low power idle periods.\n3.Self-Calibration. Self-calibration enables true 14-bit INL and\nDNL performance in the AD9707.\n4.Twos Complement/Binary Data Coding Support. Data input\nsupports twos complement or straight binary data coding.\n5.Flexible Clock Input. A selectable high speed, single-ended,\nand differential CMOS clock input supports 175 MSPS conver-\nsion rate.\n6.Device Configuration. Device can be configured through pin\nstrapping, and SPI control offers a higher level of programmabil-\nity.\n7.Easy Interfacing to Other Components. Adjustable common-\nmode output allows for easy interfacing to other signal chain\ncomponents that accept common-mode levels from 0 V to 1.2\nV.\n8.On-Chip Voltage Reference. The AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707  include a 1.0 V temperature-compensated band gap\nvoltage reference.\n9.Industry-Standard 32-Lead LFCSP Package .\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

F | 28 of 42Linearity Error (Integral Nonlinearity or INL)\nINL is defined as the maximum deviation of the actual analog\noutput from the ideal output, determined by a straight line drawn\nfrom zero to full scale.\nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL)\nDNL is the measure of the variation in analog value, normalized to\nfull scale, associated with a 1 LSB change in digital input code.\nMonotonicity\nA digital-to-analog converter is monotonic if the output either in-\ncreases or remains constant as the digital input increases.\nOffset Error\nOffset error is the deviation of the output current from the ideal of\nzero. For IOUTA, 0 mA output is expected when the inputs are all\n0s. For IOUTB, 0 mA output is expected when all inputs are set to\n1.\nGain Error\nGain error is the difference between the actual and ideal output\nspan. The actual span is determined by the output when all inputs\nare set to 1, minus the output when all inputs are set to 0. The ideal\ngain is calculated using the measured VREF. Therefore, the gain\nerror does not include effects of the reference.\nOutput Compliance Range\nOutput compliance range is the range of allowable voltage at the\noutput of a current output DAC. Operation beyond the maximum\ncompliance limits can cause either output stage saturation or break-\ndown, resulting in nonlinear performance.\nTemperature Drift\nTemperature drift is specified as the maximum change from the\nambient (25°C) value to the value at either TMIN or TMAX. For offset\nand gain drift, the drift is reported in ppm of full-scale range (FSR)\nper °C. For reference drift, the drift is reported in ppm per °C.Power Supply Rejection\nPower supply rejection is the maximum change in the full-scale\noutput as the supplies are varied from nominal to minimum and\nmaximum specified voltages.\nSettling Time\nSettling time is the time required for the output to reach and remain\nwithin a specified error band about its final value, measured from\nthe start of the output transition.\nGlitch Impulse\nAsymmetrical switching times in a DAC give rise to undesired out-\nput transients that are quantified by a glitch impulse. It is specified\nas the net area of the glitch in picovolt-seconds (pV-s).\nSpurious-Free Dynamic Range (SFDR)\nSFDR is the difference, in decibels (dB), between the rms amplitude\nof the output signal and the peak spurious signal over the specified\nbandwidth.\nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD)\nTHD is the ratio of the rms sum of the first six harmonic compo-\nnents to the rms value of the measured input signal. It is expressed\nas a percentage or in decibels (dB).\nMultitone Power Ratio\nMultitone power ratio is the spurious-free dynamic range containing\nmultiple carrier tones of equal amplitude. It is measured as the\ndifference between the rms amplitude of a carrier tone to the peak\nspurious signal in the region of a removed tone.\nNoise Spectral Density (NSD)\nNoise spectral density is the average noise power normalized to a\n1 Hz bandwidth, with the DAC converting and producing an output\ntone.\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTERMINOLOGY\nanalog.com Rev. F | 29 of 42Figure 70. Basic AC Characterization Test Setup\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 30 of 42Figure 1  shows a simplified block diagram of the AD9707. The\nAD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  consist of a DAC, digital control\nlogic, and full-scale output current control. The DAC contains a\nPMOS current source array capable of providing a nominal full-\nscale current (IOUTFS ) of 2 mA and a maximum of 5 mA. The\narray is divided into 31 equal currents that make up the five most\nsignificant bits (MSBs). The next four bits, or middle bits, consist of\n15 equal current sources whose value is 1/16 of an MSB current\nsource. The remaining LSBs are binary weighted fractions of the\ncurrent sources of the middle bits. Implementing the middle and\nlower bits with current sources, instead of an R-2R ladder, enhan-\nces the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  dynamic performance\nfor multitone or low amplitude signals and helps maintain the high\noutput impedance of the DAC (that is, >200 M Ω).\nAll of these current sources are switched to one of the two output\nnodes (IOUTA or IOUTB) via PMOS differential current switches.\nThe switches are based on the architecture pioneered in the\nAD9764  family, with further refinements made to reduce distortion\ncontributed by the switching transient. This switch architecture also\nreduces various timing errors and provides matching complementa-\nry drive signals to the inputs of the differential current switches.\nThe analog and digital sections of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707  have separate power supply inputs (AVDD, DVDD, and\nCLKVDD) that can operate over the 1.7 V to 3.6 V range but must\nhave the same voltage levels, that is, all 1.8 V or all 3.3 V. The\ndigital section, capable of operating at a rate of up to 175 MSPS,\nconsists of edge triggered latches and segment decoding logic\ncircuitry. The analog section includes the PMOS current sources,\nthe associated differential switches, a 1.0 V band gap voltage\nreference, and a reference control amplifier.\nTo ensure proper operation of the device, pulse the PIN/SPI/RESET\npin high after applying power to all three supplies. If operating the\ndevice in SPI mode, the minimum duration before setting the pin\nlow is 50 ns. If operating the device in pin mode, there is no need to\nset PIN/SPI/RESET low after pulsing it high and, alternatively, the\npin can be pulled up to AVDD.\nThe DAC full-scale output current is regulated by the reference\ncontrol amplifier and can be set from 1 mA to 5 mA via an external\nresistor, RSET, connected to the full-scale adjust (FS ADJ) pin.\nThe external resistor, in combination with both the reference control\namplifier and voltage reference, VREFIO, sets the reference current,\nIREF, which is replicated to the segmented current sources with the\nproper scaling factor. The full-scale current, IOUTFS , is 32 × IREF.\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  provide the option of setting\nthe output common mode to a value other than ACOM via the\noutput common mode (OTCM) pin. This facilitates interfacing the\noutput of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  directly to compo-\nnents that require common-mode levels greater than 0 V.SERIAL PERIPHERAL INTERFACE\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  serial port is a flexible, syn-\nchronous serial communications port that allows easy interfacing\nto many industry-standard microcontrollers and microprocessors.\nThe serial I/O is compatible with most synchronous transfer for-\nmats, including the Motorola SPI and Intel® SSR protocols. The\ninterface allows read/write access to all registers that configure the\nAD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707 . Single or multiple byte transfers\nare supported, as well as MSB first or LSB first transfer formats.\nThe serial interface port of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  is\nconfigured as a single pin I/O. SPI terminal voltages are referenced\nto ACOM.\nGeneral Operation of the Serial Interface\nThere are two phases to a communication cycle with the AD9704/\nAD9705/AD9706/AD9707 . Phase 1 is the instruction cycle, which is\nthe writing of an instruction byte into the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707 , coincident with the first eight SCLK rising edges. The\ninstruction byte provides the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  se-\nrial port controller with information regarding the data transfer\ncycle, which is Phase 2 of the communication cycle. The Phase 1\ninstruction byte defines whether the upcoming data transfer is read\nor write, the number of bytes in the data transfer, and the starting\nregister address for the first byte of the data transfer.\nA logic high on Pin 17 (PIN/SPI/RESET), followed by a logic low,\nresets the SPI port timing to the initial state of the instruction cycle.\nThis is true regardless of the present state of the internal registers\nor the other signal levels present at the inputs to the SPI port. If\nthe SPI port is in the midst of an instruction cycle or a data transfer\ncycle, none of the present data is written.\nThe remaining SCLK edges are for Phase 2 of the communication\ncycle. Phase 2 is the actual data transfer between the AD9704/\nAD9705/AD9706/AD9707  and the system controller. Phase 2 of the\ncommunication cycle is a transfer of one, two, three, or four data\nbytes, as determined by the instruction byte. Using one multibyte\ntransfer is the preferred method. Single byte data transfers are\nuseful to reduce CPU overhead when register access requires one\nbyte only. Registers change immediately upon writing to the last bit\nof each transfer byte.\nInstruction Byte\nThe instruction byte contains the information shown in the bit map\nin Table 13 .\nTable 13.\nMSB LSB\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\nR/W N1 N0 A4 A3 A2 A1 A0\nR/W, Bit 7 of the instruction byte, determines whether a read or\na write data transfer occurs after the instruction byte write.

Logic 0 indicates a write operation.\nN1 and N0, Bit 6 and Bit 5 of the instruction byte, determine the\nnumber of bytes to be transferred during the data transfer cycle.\nThe bit decodes are shown in Table 14 .\nA4, A3, A2, A1, and A0, which are Bit 4, Bit 3, Bit 2, Bit 1,\nand Bit 0 of the instruction byte, respectively, determine which\nregister is accessed during the data transfer portion of the commu-\nnication cycle. For multibyte transfers, this address is the starting\nbyte address. The remaining register addresses are generated by\nthe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707 , based on the DATADIR bit\n(Register 0x00, Bit 6).\nTable 14. Byte Transfer Count\nN1 N0 Description\n0 0 Transfer 1 byte\n0 1 Transfer 2 bytes\n1 0 Transfer 3 bytes\n1 1 Transfer 4 bytes\nSerial Interface Port Pin Descriptions\nSCLK—Serial Clock. The serial clock pin is used to synchronize\ndata to and from the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  and to run\nthe internal state machines. The SCLK maximum frequency is 20\nMHz. All data input to the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  is\nregistered on the rising edge of SCLK. All data is driven out of the\nAD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  on the falling edge of SCLK.\nCSB—Chip Select. Active low input starts and gates a communi-\ncation cycle. It allows more than one device to be used on the\nsame serial communications lines. The SDIO pin goes to a high\nimpedance state when this input is high. Chip select must stay low\nduring the entire communication cycle.\nSDIO—Serial Data I/O. This pin is used as a bidirectional data line\nto transmit and receive data.\nMSB/LSB Transfers\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  serial port can support both\nmost significant bit (MSB) first or least significant bit (LSB) first\ndata formats. This functionality is controlled by the DATADIR bit\n(Register 0x00, Bit 6). The default is MSB first (DATADIR = 0).\nWhen DATADIR = 0 (MSB first), the instruction and data bytes must\nbe written from most significant bit to least significant bit. Multibyte\ndata transfers in MSB first format start with an instruction byte\nthat includes the register address of the most significant data byte.\nSubsequent data bytes should follow in order from high address\nto low address. In MSB first mode, the serial port internal byte\naddress generator decrements for each data byte of the multibyte\ncommunication cycle.\nWhen DATADIR = 1 (LSB first), the instruction and data bytes must\nbe written from least significant bit to most significant bit. Multibyte\ndata transfers in LSB first format start with an instruction byte thatincludes the register address of the least significant data byte fol-\nlowed by multiple data bytes. The serial port internal byte address\ngenerator increments for each byte of the multibyte communication\ncycle.\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  serial port controller data\naddress decrements from the data address written toward 0x00 for\nmultibyte I/O operations if the MSB first mode is active. The serial\nport controller address increments from the data address written\ntoward 0x1F for multibyte I/O operations if the LSB first mode is\nactive.\nNotes on Serial Port Operation\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  serial port configuration is\ncontrolled by Register 0x00, Bit 7. It is important to note that the\nconfiguration changes immediately upon writing to the last bit of the\nregister. For multibyte transfers, writing to this register can occur\nduring the middle of the communication cycle. Care must be taken\nto compensate for this new configuration for the remaining bytes of\nthe current communication cycle.\nThe same considerations apply to setting the software reset,\nSWRST (Register 0x00, Bit 5). All registers are set to their default\nvalues except Register 0x00, which remains unchanged.\nUse of single byte transfers is recommended when changing serial\nport configurations or initiating a software reset to prevent unex-\npected device behavior.\nIn Figure 75 , the minimum SPI clock period tSCLK is 50 ns. The\nminimum duration for the high and low pulse widths of the SPI\nclock, tPWH and tPWL, respectively, is 25 ns.\nFigure 76  shows the duration tDLY from the SCLK falling edge that\ndata read is driven out of the SDIO pin. The typical value of tDLY is 2\nns.\nThe input setup time, tS, and input hold time, tH, for both read\nand write operations depend on the operating supply voltage and\ntemperature. Refer to Table 3  and Table 6 .\nFigure 71. Serial Register Interface Timing, MSB First Write\nFigure 72.

Timing Diagram for SPI Register Read\nPIN MODE\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  can also be operated with-\nout ever writing to the serial port. With PIN/SPI/RESET (Pin 17)\ntied high, the CMODE/SCLK (Pin 15) is set to pin mode (CMODE\nfunction) to provide for clock mode control (see the Clock Input\nsection). The MODE/SDIO pin is set to pin mode (MODE function)\nand selects the input data format, and the SLEEP/CSB pin serves\nto power down the device. The CMODE/SCLK, MODE/SDIO, and\nSLEEP/CSB pins are not latched at power-up. If the data format is\nchanged, it is required to wait 1 μs after power-up to ensure proper\nfunction.\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev.

The internal reference can be disabled by\nwriting a Logic 1 to Register 0x00, Bit 0 (EXREF) in the SPI.\nThe internal 1.0 V band gap reference ramps up for around 2 ms\nwhen the proper power-up conditions in the Power Supply  section\nare followed.\nTo use the internal reference, decouple the REFIO pin to ACOM\nwith a 0.1 µF capacitor and enable the internal reference by writing\na Logic 0 to Register 0x00, Bit 0 in the SPI. (Note that this setting is\nthe default configuration.) The internal reference voltage is present\nat REFIO. If the voltage at REFIO is to be used anywhere else in\nthe circuit, an external buffer amplifier with an input bias current of\nless than 100 nA must be used to avoid loading the reference. An\nexample of the use of the internal reference is shown in Figure 77 .Figure 77. Internal Reference Configuration\nREFIO serves as either an input or an output, depending on\nwhether the internal or an external reference is used. Table 23\nsummarizes the reference operation.\nTable 23. Reference Operation\nReference\nMode REFIO Pin Register Setting\nInternal Connect 0.1 µF capacitor Register 0x00, Bit 0 = 0\n(default)\nExternal Apply external reference Register 0x00, Bit 0 = 1 (for\npower saving)\nAn external reference is required in applications that need gain\ntolerances with minimal variation or lower temperature drift. The\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 35 of 42ADR130  precision voltage reference or equivalent is recommended\nfor AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707 , and its analog supply can be\nconnected to AVDD. Refer to Figure 78 .\nFigure 78. External Reference Configuration\nAlso, a variable external voltage reference can be used to imple-\nment a method for gain control of the DAC output. The external\nreference is applied to the REFIO pin. Note that the 0.1 µF com-\npensation capacitor is not required. The internal reference can\nbe directly overdriven by the external reference, or the internal\nreference can be powered down. The input impedance of REFIO is\n10 kΩ when powered up and 1 M Ω when powered down.\nREFERENCE CONTROL AMPLIFIER\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  contain a control amplifier\nthat regulates the full-scale output current, IOUTFS . The control\namplifier is configured as a V-I converter, as shown in Figure 77 .\nThe output current, IREF, is determined by the ratio of the VREFIO\nand an external resistor, RSET, as stated in Equation 4 . IREF is\nmirrored to the segmented current sources with the proper scale\nfactor to set IOUTFS , as stated in Equation 3 .\nThe control amplifier allows a 5:1 adjustment span of IOUTFS  from\n1 mA to 5 mA by setting IREF between 31.25 µA and 156.25 µA\n(RSET between 6.4 k Ω and 32 k Ω). The wide adjustment span of\nIOUTFS  provides several benefits. The first relates directly to the\npower dissipation of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707 , which\nis proportional to IOUTFS  (see the Power Dissipation  section). The\nsecond benefit relates to the ability to adjust the output over a 14\ndB range, which is useful for controlling the transmitted power.\nDAC TRANSFER FUNCTION\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  provide complementary cur-\nrent outputs, IOUTA and IOUTB. IOUTA provides a near full-scale\ncurrent output, IOUTFS , when all bits are high (that is, DAC CODE =\n2N − 1, where N = 8, 10, 12, or 14 for the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707 , respectively), while IOUTB, the complementary output,\nprovides no current. The current output appearing at IOUTA and\nIOUTB is a function of both the input code and IOUTFS  and can be\nexpressed as\nIOUTA  = (DAC CODE /2N) × IOUTFS (1)\nIOUTB  = ((2N − 1) − DAC CODE )/2N × IOUTFS (2)\nwhere DAC CODE  = 0 to 2N − 1 (that is, decimal representation).IOUTFS  is a function of the reference current, IREF, which is nominal-\nly set by a reference voltage, VREFIO, and an external resistor, RSET.\nIt can be expressed as\nIOUTFS  = 32 × IREF (3)\nwhere\nIREF = VREFIO/RSET (4)\nThe two current outputs typically drive a resistive load directly or\nvia a transformer. If dc coupling is required, IOUTA and IOUTB\nshould be connected to matching resistive loads (RLOAD) that are\ntied to analog common (ACOM). The single-ended voltage output\nappearing at the IOUTA and IOUTB nodes is\nVIOUTA = IOUTA  × RLOAD (5)\nVIOUTB = IOUTB  × RLOAD (6)\nTo achieve a 1 V p-p output at the nominal 2 mA output current,\nRLOAD must be set to 500 Ω.\nAlso, the full-scale value of VIOUTA and VIOUTB must not exceed the\nspecified output compliance range to maintain specified distortion\nand linearity performance.\nVDIFF = (IOUTA  – IOUTB ) × RLOAD (7)\nSubstituting the values of IOUTA, IOUTB, IREF, and VDIFF can be\nexpressed as\nVDIFF = {(2 × DAC CODE  – (2N − 1))/2N} ×\n(32 × VREFIO/RSET) × RLOAD(8)\nEquation 7  and Equation 8  highlight some of the advantages of\noperating the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  differentially. First,\nthe differential operation helps cancel common-mode error sources\nassociated with IOUTA and IOUTB, such as noise, distortion, and\ndc offsets. Second, the differential code dependent current and\nsubsequent voltage, VDIFF, is twice the value of the single-ended\nvoltage output (that is, VIOUTA or VIOUTB), thus providing twice the\nsignal power to the load.\nThe gain drift temperature performance for a single-ended output\n(VIOUTA and VIOUTB) or the differential output (VDIFF) of the AD9704/\nAD9705/AD9706/AD9707  can be enhanced by selecting tempera-\nture tracking resistors for RLOAD and RSET, because of their ratio-\nmetric relationship, as shown in Equation 8 .\nANALOG OUTPUTS\nThe complementary current outputs in each DAC, IOUTA, and\nIOUTB can be configured for single-ended or differential operation.\nIOUTA and IOUTB can be converted into complementary single-\nended voltage outputs, VIOUTA and VIOUTB, via a load resistor,\nRLOAD, as described in the DAC Transfer Function  section by\nEquation 5  through Equation 8 . The differential voltage, VDIFF,\nexisting between VIOUTA and VIOUTB, can also be converted to a\nsingle-ended voltage via a transformer or a differential amplifier\nconfiguration. The ac performance of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 36 of 42AD9707  is optimum and is specified using a differential transformer-\ncoupled output in which the voltage swing at IOUTA and IOUTB is\nlimited to ±0.5 V.\nThe distortion and noise performance of the AD9704/AD9705/\nAD9706/AD9707  can be enhanced when it is configured for differ-\nential operation. The common-mode error sources of both IOUTA\nand IOUTB can be significantly reduced by the common-mode\nrejection of a transformer or differential amplifier. These common-\nmode error sources include even-order distortion products and\nnoise. The enhancement in distortion performance becomes more\nsignificant as the frequency content of the reconstructed waveform\nincreases and/or its amplitude increases. This is due to the first-\norder cancellation of various dynamic common-mode distortion\nmechanisms, digital feedthrough, and noise.\nPerforming a differential-to-single-ended conversion via a trans-\nformer also provides the ability to deliver twice the reconstructed\nsignal power to the load (assuming no source termination). Be-\ncause the output currents of IOUTA and IOUTB are complementary,\nthey become additive when processed differentially.\nWhen the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  is being used at its\nnominal operating point of 2 mA output current and 0.5 V output\nswing is desired, RLOAD must be set to 250 Ω. A properly se-\nlected transformer allows the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  to\nprovide the required power and voltage levels to different loads.\nThe output impedance of IOUTA and IOUTB is determined by the\nequivalent parallel combination of the PMOS switches associated\nwith the current sources and is typically 200 M Ω in parallel with 5\npF. It is also slightly dependent on the output voltage (that is, VIOUTA\nand VIOUTB) due to the nature of a PMOS device. As a result,\nmaintaining IOUTA and/or IOUTB at a virtual ground via an I-V op\namp configuration results in the optimum dc linearity. Note that the\nINL/DNL specifications for the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nare measured with IOUTA maintained at a virtual ground via an op\namp.\nIOUTA and IOUTB also have a negative and positive voltage com-\npliance range that must be adhered to in order to achieve optimum\nperformance. The absolute maximum negative output compliance\nrange of −1 V is set by the breakdown limits of the CMOS process.\nOperation beyond this maximum limit can result in a breakdown\nof the output stage and affect the reliability of the AD9704/AD9705/\nAD9706/AD9707 .\nThe positive output compliance range is slightly dependent on the\nfull-scale output current, IOUTFS . It degrades slightly from its nominal\n1.0 V for an IOUTFS  = 2 mA to 0.8 V for an IOUTFS  = 1 mA. The\noptimum distortion performance for a single-ended or differential\noutput is achieved when the maximum full-scale signal at IOUTA\nand IOUTB does not exceed 0.5 V.\nADJUSTABLE OUTPUT COMMON MODE\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  provide the ability to set the\noutput common mode to a value other than ACOM via Pin 19(OTCM). This extends the compliance range of the outputs and\nfacilitates interfacing the output of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707  to components that require common-mode levels other\nthan 0 V. The OTCM pin demands dynamically changing current\nand should be driven by a low source impedance to prevent a\ncommon-mode signal from appearing on the DAC outputs. The\nOTCM pin also serves to change the DAC bias voltages in the\nparts, allowing them to run at higher dc output bias voltages. When\nrunning the bias voltage below 0.9 V and an AVDD of 3.3 V, the\nparts perform optimally when the OTCM pin is tied to ground. When\nthe dc bias increases above 0.9 V, set the OTCM pin at 0.5 V\nfor optimal performance. Keep the maximum dc bias on the DAC\noutput at or below 1.2 V when the supply is 3.3 V. When the supply\nis 1.8 V, keep the dc bias close to 0 V and connect the OTCM\npin directly to ground. Note that setting OTCM to a voltage greater\nthan ACOM allows the peak of the output signal to be closer to\nthe positive supply rail. To prevent distortion in the output signal\ndue to limited available headroom, the common-mode level must be\nchosen such that the following expression is satisfied:\nAVDD  − VOTCM > 1.8 V (9)\nDIGITAL INPUTS\nThe AD9707, AD9706, AD9705, and AD9704 have data inputs of\n14, 12, 10, and 8 bits, respectively, and each has a clock input.\nThe parallel data inputs can follow standard positive binary or twos\ncomplement coding. IOUTA produces a full-scale output current\nwhen all data bits are at Logic 1. IOUTB produces a complementary\noutput with the full-scale current split between the two outputs as a\nfunction of the input code.\nFigure 79. Equivalent Digital Input\nThe digital interface is implemented using an edge-triggered mas-\nter/slave latch. The DAC output updates on the rising edge of the\nclock and is designed to support a clock rate as high as 175 MSPS.\nThe clock can be operated at any duty cycle that meets the speci-\nfied latch pulse width. The setup and hold times can also be varied\nwithin the clock cycle, as long as the specified minimum times\nare met, although the location of these transition edges may affect\ndigital feedthrough and distortion performance. Best performance\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 37 of 42is typically achieved when the input data transitions on the falling\nedge of a 50% duty cycle clock.\nDeskew Mode\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  provide an optional deskew\nmode. Turning on the deskew mode can improve the skew glitch\nbehavior of the DAC. With the deskew mode enabled, a one\nCLK+/CLK − clock cycle register delay is added to the digital input\npath. By default, the DESKEW bit in the data register (0x02) is set\nto 0, disabling the deskew mode.\nCLOCK INPUT\nA configurable clock input allows the device to be operated in a\nsingle-ended or a differential clock mode. The mode selection can\nbe controlled either by the CMODE pin, if the device is in pin mode;\nor through Register 0x02, Bit 2 (CLKDIFF) of the SPI registers, if\nthe SPI is enabled. Connecting CMODE to CLKCOM selects the\nsingle-ended clock input. In this mode, the CLK+ input is driven with\nrail-to-rail swings, and the CLK − input is left floating. If CMODE is\nconnected to CLKVDD, the differential receiver mode is selected.\nIn this mode, both inputs are high impedance. Table 24  gives a\nsummary of clock mode control. There is no significant performance\ndifference between the clock input modes.\nTable 24. Clock Mode Selection\nSPI Disabled,\nCMODE PinSPI Enabled, Register\n0x02, Bit 2 Clock Input Mode\nCLKCOM 0 Single ended\nCLKVDD 1 Differential\nIn differential input mode, the clock input functions as a high\nimpedance differential pair. The common-mode level of the CLK+\nand CLK − inputs can vary from 0.75 V to 2.25 V, and the differential\nvoltage can be as low as 0.5 V p-p. This mode can be used to\ndrive the clock with a differential sine wave because the high gain\nbandwidth of the differential inputs converts the sine wave into a\nsingle-ended square wave internally.\nDAC TIMING\nInput Clock and Data Timing Relationship\nDynamic performance in a DAC is dependent on the relationship\nbetween the position of the clock edges and the time at which the\ninput data changes. To achieve the DAC performance specified\nin this data sheet, data input (DB) and clock (CLK+/CLK −) must\nmeet the setup and hold time requirements specified in the relevant\ndigital specifications.\nPOWER DISSIPATION\nThe power dissipation, PD, of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707  is dependent on several factors that include\n►The power supply voltages (AVDD, CLKVDD, and DVDD)\n►The full-scale current output, IOUTFS►The update rate, fCLOCK\n►The reconstructed digital input waveform\nPower dissipation is directly proportional to the analog supply\ncurrent, IAVDD, and the digital supply current, IDVDD. IAVDD is equal\nto a fixed current plus IOUTFS , as shown in Figure 80 . IDVDD is\nproportional to fCLOCK  and increases with increasing analog output\nfrequencies. Figure 82  shows IDVDD as a function of full-scale sine\nwave output ratios (fOUT/fCLOCK ) for various update rates with DVDD\n= 3.3 V. ICLKVDD  is directly proportional to fCLOCK  and is higher\nfor differential clock operation than for single-ended operation, as\nshown in Figure 84 . This difference in clock current is due primarily\nto the differential clock receiver, which is disabled in single-ended\nclock mode.\nFigure 80. IAVDD vs. IOUTFS  at AVDD = 3.3 V\nFigure 81. IAVDD vs. IOUTFS  at AVDD = 1.8 V\nFigure 82. IDVDD vs. fOUT/fCLOCK  Ratio at DVDD = 3.3 V\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 38 of 42Figure 83.

ICLKVDD  vs. fCLOCK  (Differential Clock Mode) at CLKVDD = 1.8 V\nSleep Operation (Pin Mode)\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  have a sleep mode that\nturns off the output current and reduces the total power consumed\nby the device. This mode is activated by applying a Logic 1 to the\nSLEEP/CSB pin. The SLEEP/CSB pin logic threshold is equal to\n0.5 × DVDD. This digital input also contains an active pull-down\ncircuit.\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  take less than 50 ns to\npower down and approximately 5 µs to power back up, when 3.3 V\nAVDD is used.Sleep and Power-Down Operation (SPI Mode)\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  offer three power-down\nfunctions that can be controlled through the SPI. These power-\ndown modes can be used to minimize the power dissipation of the\ndevice. The power-down functions are controlled through Register\n0x00, Bit 1 to Bit 3, of the SPI registers. Table 25  summarizes\nthe power-down functions that can be controlled through the SPI.\nThe power-down mode can be enabled by writing a Logic 1 to the\ncorresponding bit in Register 0x00.\nTable 25. Power-Down Mode Selection\nPower-Down Mode(Reg. 0x00) Bit\nNumber Functional Description\nClock Off 1 Turn off clock\nSleep 2 Turn off output current\nPower Down 3 Turn off output current and internal band\ngap reference\nSELF-CALIBRATION\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  have a self-calibration fea-\nture that improves the DNL of the device. Performing a self-calibra-\ntion on the device improves device performance in low frequency\napplications. The device performance in applications where the an-\nalog output frequencies are above 1 MHz are generally influenced\nmore by dynamic device behavior than by DNL, and in these cases,\nself-calibration is unlikely to provide any benefits for single-tones,\nas shown in Figure 86 . Figure 87  shows that self-calibration is\nhelpful up to 20 MHz for two-tone IMD spaced 10 kHz apart.\nFigure 86. AD9707 SFDR vs. fOUT at 175 MSPS and IOUTFS  = 2 mA\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 39 of 42Figure 87. IMD vs. Lower fOUT at 175 MSPS and IOUTFS  = 2 mA\nThe calibration clock frequency is equal to the DAC clock divided\nby the division factor chosen by the DIVSEL value. The frequency\nof the calibration clock must be set to under 10 MHz for reliable\ncalibrations. Best results are obtained by setting DIVSEL[2:0] (Reg-\nister 0x0E, Bit 2 to Bit 0) to produce the lowest frequency calibration\nclock frequency that the system requirements of the user allows.\nTo perform a device self-calibration, use the following procedure:\n1.Enable the calibration clock by setting the CALCLK bit (Register\n0x02, Bit 0).\n2.Enable self-calibration by writing 0x40 to Register 0x0F.\n3.Wait approximately 4500 calibration clock cycles. Each calibra-\ntion clock cycle is between 2 DAC clock cycles and 256 DAC\nclock cycles, depending on the value of DIVSEL[2:0].\n4.Check if the self-calibration has completed by reading the\nCALSTAT bit (Register 0x0F, Bit 7). A Logic 1 indicates the\ncalibration has completed.\n5.When the self-calibration has completed, write 0x00 to Register\n0x0F.\n6.Disable the calibration clock by clearing the CALCLK bit (Regis-\nter 0x02, Bit 0).\nThe AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  devices allow reading and\nwriting of the calibration coefficients. There are 33 coefficients in\ntotal. The read/write feature of the coefficients can be useful for\nimproving the results of the self-calibration routine by averaging\nthe results of several calibration results and loading the averaged\nresults back into the device. The reading and writing routines follow.\nTo read the calibration coefficients to the device:\n1.Enable the calibration clock by setting the CALCLK bit (Register\n0x02, Bit 0).\n2.Write the address of the first coefficient (0x00) to Register 0x10.\n3.Set the SMEMRD bit (Register 0x0F, Bit 2) by writing 0x04 to\nRegister 0x0F.\n4.Wait at least 160 CLK+/CLK − clock cycles.\n5.Read the value of the first coefficient by reading the contents of\nRegister 0x11.\n6.Clear the SMEMRD bit by writing 0x00 to Register 0x0F.7.Repeat Step 2 through Step 6 for each of the remaining 32\ncoefficients by incrementing the address by one for each read.\n8.Disable the calibration clock by clearing the CALCLK Bit (Regis-\nter 0x02, Bit 0).\nTo write the calibration coefficients to the device:\n1.Enable the calibration clock by setting the CALCLK bit (Register\n0x02, Bit 0).\n2.Set the SMEMWR bit (Register 0x0F, Bit 3) by writing 0x08 to\nRegister 0x0F.\n3.Write the address of the first coefficient (0x00) to Register 0x10.\n4.Write the value of the first coefficient to Register 0x11.\n5.Wait at least 160 CLK+/CLK − clock cycles\n6.Repeat Step 3 through Step 5 for each of the remaining 32\ncoefficients by incrementing the address by one for each write.\n7.Clear the SMEMWR bit by writing 0x00 to Register 0x0F.\n8.Disable the calibration clock by clearing the CALCLK bit (Regis-\nter 0x02, Bit 0).\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. F | 40 of 42OUTPUT CONFIGURATIONS\nThe following sections illustrate some typical output configurations\nfor the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707 . Unless otherwise noted,\nit is assumed that IOUTFS  is set to a nominal 2 mA. For applications\nrequiring the optimum dynamic performance, a differential output\nconfiguration is suggested. A differential output configuration can\nconsist of either an RF transformer or a differential op amp config-\nuration. The transformer configuration provides the optimum high\nfrequency performance and is recommended for any application\nthat allows ac coupling. The differential op amp configuration is suit-\nable for applications requiring dc coupling, signal gain, and/or a low\noutput impedance. A single-ended output is suitable for applications\nwhere low cost and low power consumption are primary concerns.\nDIFFERENTIAL COUPLING USING A\nTRANSFORMER\nAn RF transformer can be used to perform a differential-to-single-\nended signal conversion, as shown in Figure 88 . The distortion\nperformance of a transformer typically exceeds that available from\nstandard op amps, particularly at higher frequencies. Transformer\ncoupling provides excellent rejection of common-mode distortion\n(that is, even-order harmonics) over a wide frequency range. It also\nprovides electrical isolation and can deliver voltage gain without\nadding noise. Transformers with different impedance ratios can also\nbe used for impedance matching purposes. The main disadvantag-\nes of transformer coupling are the low frequency roll-off, lack of\npower gain, and the higher output impedance.\nFigure 88. Differential Output Using a Transformer\nThe center tap on the primary side of the transformer must be\nconnected to a voltage that keeps the voltages on IOUTA and\nIOUTB within the output common voltage range of the device.\nNote that the dc component of the DAC output current is equal to\nIFS/2 and flows out of both IOUTA and IOUTB. The center tap of\nthe transformer should provide a path for this dc current. In many\napplications, AGND provides the most convenient voltage for the\ntransformer center tap. The complementary voltages appearing at\nIOUTA and IOUTB (that is, VIOUTA and VIOUTB) swing symmetrically\naround AGND and should be maintained with the specified output\ncompliance range of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707 .\nA differential resistor, RDIFF, can be inserted in applications where\nthe output of the transformer is connected to the load, RLOAD, via\na passive reconstruction filter or cable. RDIFF, as reflected by the\ntransformer, is chosen to provide a source termination that results\nin a low VSWR. Note that approximately half the signal power is\ndissipated across RDIFF.SINGLE-ENDED BUFFERED OUTPUT USING\nAN OP AMP\nFigure 89  shows a buffered single-ended output configuration in\nwhich the ADA4899-1  op amp performs a single-ended current-to-\nvoltage conversion on the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  output\ncurrent. The ADA4899-1  maintains IOUTA (or IOUTB) at a virtual\nground, minimizing the nonlinear output impedance effect on the\nINL performance of the DAC as described in the Analog Outputs\nsection. Although this single-ended configuration typically provides\noptimal dc linearity performance, its ac distortion performance at\nhigher DAC update rates may be limited by the slew rate capabili-\nties of the op amp. The ADA4899-1 provides a negative unipolar\noutput voltage, and its full-scale output voltage is simply the product\nof the feedback resistor, RFB (200 Ω ), and IOUTFS . The full-scale\noutput must be set within the voltage output swing capabilities of\nthe ADA4899-1 by scaling IOUTFS  and/or RFB. An improvement in ac\ndistortion performance may result in a reduced IOUTFS  because the\nsignal current at the op amp is required to sink less signal current.\nFigure 89. Unipolar Buffered Voltage\nDIFFERENTIAL BUFFERED OUTPUT USING AN\nOP AMP\nAn op amp can also be used to perform a differential-to-single-\nended conversion, as shown in Figure 90 . The AD9704/AD9705/\nAD9706/AD9707  is configured with two equal load resistors, RLOAD,\nof 100 Ω. The differential voltage developed across IOUTA and IOUTB\nis converted to a single-ended signal via the differential op amp\nconfiguration. An optional capacitor can be installed across IOUTA\nand IOUTB, forming a real pole in a low-pass filter. The addition\nof this capacitor also enhances the distortion performance of the\nop amp by preventing the high slewing output of the DAC from\noverloading the input of the op amp.  \nThe common-mode rejection of this configuration is typically deter-\nmined by the resistor matching. In this circuit, the differential op\namp circuit using the ADA4899-1  is configured to provide some\nadditional signal gain. The op amp must operate from a dual supply\nbecause its output is approximately ±1 V. Select a high speed\namplifier capable of preserving the differential performance of the\nAD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707  while meeting other system level\nobjectives (such as cost or power).

F | 41 of 42setting resistor values, and full-scale output swing capabilities of the\nop amp must all be considered when optimizing this circuit.\nFigure 90. Differential Buffered Voltage Output\nPOWER SUPPLY\nRequirements\nThe analog and digital sections of the AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/\nAD9707  have separate power supply inputs (AVDD, DVDD, and\nCLKVDD) that can operate over the 1.7 V to 3.6 V range but must\nhave the same voltage levels, that is, all 1.8 V or all 3.3 V.\nTo ensure proper operation of the device, pulse the PIN/SPI/RESET\npin low to high to low after applying power to all three supplies. The\nminimum PIN/SPI/RESET pulse width is 50 ns.\nRecommendations\nThe user can employ several different decoupling capacitors to\ncover both high and low frequencies. These capacitors must be\nlocated close to the point of entry at the printed circuit board\n(PCB) level and close to the devices, with minimal trace lengths.\nRecommended decoupling capacitor values for each supply pin are\none of each of the following: 10 nF, 0.1 μF, and 10 μF. The smallest\nvalue capacitor must be placed nearest to the supply pin.\nData Sheet AD9704/AD9705/AD9706/AD9707\nOUTLINE DIMENSIONS\n©2006-2022 Analog Devices, Inc. All rights reserved.
