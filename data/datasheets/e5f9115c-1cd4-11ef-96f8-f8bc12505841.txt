Pin Functions\nPIN\nTYPE(1)DESCRIPTION\nNO. NAME\n1 RT IFrequency setting pin. This analog pin is used to set the switching frequency between 200 kHz and \n2.2 MHz by placing an external resistor from this pin to AGND. Do not leave open or connect to \nground.\n2 EN/SYNC IPrecision enable input pin. High = on, Low = off. Can be connected to VIN. Precision enable allows \nthe pin to be used as an adjustable UVLO. It also functions as the synchronization input pin. Used \nto synchronize the device switching frequency to a system clock. Triggers on the rising edge of an \nexternal clock. A capacitor can be used to AC couple the synchronization signal to this pin. The \nmodule can be turned off by using an open-drain or collector device to connect this pin to AGND. An \nexternal voltage divider can be placed between this pin, AGND, and VIN to create an external UVLO.\n3, 4, 18, 19 VIN PInput supply voltage. Connect the input supply to these pins. Connect input capacitors between these \npins and PGND in close proximity to the device. Refer to Section 10.2 for input capacitor placement \nexample.\n5, 6, 16, 17, \n28, 29PGND GPower ground. This is the return current path for the power stage of the device. Connect this pad to \nthe input supply return, the load return, and the capacitors associated with the VIN and VOUT pins. \nSee Section 10.2 for a recommended layout.\n7-10, 12–15, \n30VOUT POutput voltage. These pins are connected to the internal output inductor. Connect these pins to the \noutput load and connect external output capacitors between these pins and PGND.\n11 SW OSwitch node. Do not place any external component on this pin or connect to any signal. The amount \nof copper placed on these pins must be kept to a minimum to prevent issues with noise and EMI.\n20 CBOOT I/OBootstrap pin for internal high-side driver circuitry. A 100-nF bootstrap capacitor is internally \nconnected from this pin to SW within the module to provide the bootstrap voltage. This pin is brought \nout to use in conjunction with RBOOT to effectively lower the value of the internal RBOOT resistor to \nadjust the SW node slew rate, if necessary.\n21 RBOOT I/OExternal bootstrap resistor connection. Internal to the device, a 100-Ω bootstrap resistor is connected \nbetween this pin and the CBOOT pin. This pin is brought out to use in conjunction with CBOOT \nto effectively lower the value of the internal RBOOT resistor to adjust the switch node slew rate, if \nnecessary.\n22 VLDOIN PInput bias voltage. Supplies the control circuitry of the power module. Input to internal LDO. Connect \nto an output voltage point to improve efficiency. Connect an optional high quality 0.1-μF to 1-μF \ncapacitor from this pin to ground for improved noise immunity. If the output voltage is above 12 V, \nconnect this pin to ground.\n23 VCC OInternal LDO output. Used as supply to internal control circuits. Do not connect to any external loads. \nConnect a high-quality 1-μF ceramic capacitor from this pin to PGND.\n24, 27 AGND GAnalog ground. Zero voltage reference for internal references and logic. All electrical parameters are \nmeasured with respect to this pin. This pin must be connected to PGND at a single point.  See \nSection 10.2 for a recommended layout.\n25 FB IFeedback input. For the adjustable output version, connect the mid-point of the feedback resistor \ndivider to this pin. Connect the upper resistor (R FBT) of the feedback divider to V OUT at the desired \npoint of regulation. Connect the lower resistor (R FBB) of the feedback divider to AGND. When \nconnecting with feedback resistor divider, keep this FB trace short and as small as possible to \navoid noise coupling. See Section 10.2 for a feedback resistor placement. For a fixed output version, \nconnect this pin directly to output capacitor. Do not leave open or connect to ground.\n26 PG OPower-good monitor. Open-drain output that asserts low if the feedback voltage is not within the \nspecified window thresholds. A 10-kΩ to 100-kΩ pullup resistor is required to a suitable pullup \nvoltage. If not used, this pin can be left open or connected to PGND.\n(1) P = Power, G = Ground, I = Input, O = OutputTPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n6 Specifications\n6.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nLimits apply over TJ = –40°C to 125°C  (unless otherwise noted).

The device is intended for step-down conversions from 5-V, 12-V, and 24-V supply rails. With an \nintegrated power controller, inductor, and MOSFETs, the TPSM63603  delivers up to 3-A DC load current, with \nhigh efficiency and ultra-low input quiescent current, in a very small solution size. Although designed for simple \nimplementation, this device offers flexibility to optimize its usage according to the target application. Control-loop \ncompensation is not required, reducing design time and external component count.\nWith a programmable switching frequency from 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz using its RT pin  or an external clock signal , \nthe TPSM63603  incorporates specific features to improve EMI performance in noise-sensitive applications:\n•An optimized package and pinout design enables a shielded switch-node layout that mitigates radiated EMI\n•Parallel input and output paths with symmetrical capacitor layouts minimize parasitic inductance, switch-\nvoltage ringing, and radiated field coupling\n•Pseudo-random spread spectrum (PRSS)  modulation in the TPSM63603S reduces peak emissions\n•Clock synchronization and FPWM mode enable constant switching frequency across the load current range\n•Integrated power MOSFETs with enhanced gate drive control enable low-noise PWM switching\n•Adjustable switch-node slew rate, which allows optimization of EMI at higher frequency harmonics\nThe TPSM63603  module also includes inherent protection features for robust system requirements:\n•An open-drain PGOOD indicator for power-rail sequencing and fault reporting\n•Precision enable input with hysteresis, providing\n–Programmable line undervoltage lockout (UVLO)\n–Remote ON/OFF capability\n•Internally fixed output-voltage soft start with monotonic startup into prebiased loads\n•Hiccup-mode overcurrent protection with cycle-by-cycle peak and valley current limits\n•Thermal shutdown with automatic recovery.\nThese features enable a flexible and easy-to-use platform for a wide range of applications.

Voltage ringing at the VIN pins that exceeds \nthe absolute maximum ratings can damage the IC.\n7.3.2 Adjustable Output Voltage (FB)\nThe TPSM63603  has an adjustable output voltage range of 1 V to 16 V. Setting the output voltage requires two \nresistors, R FBT and R FBB (see Figure 7-2 ). Connect R FBT between VOUT, at the regulation point, and the FB pin. \nConnect R FBB between the FB pin and AGND (pin 10). The recommended value of R FBB is 10 k Ω. The value for \nRFBT can be calculated using Equation 1 . Table 7-1  lists the standard resistor values for several output voltages \nand the recommended switching frequency. The minimum required output capacitance for each output voltage is \nalso included in Table 7-1 . The capacitance values listed represent the effective capacitance, taking into account \nthe effects of DC bias and temperature variation.\n(1)www.ti.comTPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\nAGNDVOUT\nFBRFBT\nRFBB\n10 kΩFigure 7-2.

However, R FBT larger than 1 M Ω is not recommended as the feedback path becomes more susceptible \nto noise. High feedback resistance generally requires more careful layout of the feedback path. It is important to \nkeep the feedback trace as short as possible while keeping the feedback trace away from the noisy area of the \nPCB. For more layout recommendations, see Section 10.\nFixed Output Voltage Variants\nThe TPSM63603V3  and TPSM63603V5  are the fixed output voltage variants of the module with 3.3-V and 5-V \nfixed output voltages, respectively. In these variants, the resistor feedback dividers are located internal to the \nmodule. Therefore, the FB pin can be connected directly to output voltage regulation point.\n7.3.3 Input Capacitors\nInput capacitors are necessary to limit the input ripple voltage to the module due to switching-frequency AC \ncurrents. TI recommends using ceramic capacitors to provide low impedance and high RMS current rating over \na wide temperature range. Equation 2  gives the input capacitor RMS current. The highest input capacitor RMS \ncurrent occurs at D = 0.5, at which point the RMS current rating of the capacitors should be greater than half the \noutput current.\n\x0b \x0c2\n2 L\nCIN,rms OUTII D I 1 D12§ · \'¨ ¸  \x98 \x98 \x10 \x0e¨ ¸ © ¹ \n(2)TPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\nwhere\n•D = V OUT / VIN = the module duty cycle\nIdeally, the DC and AC components of input current to the buck stage are provided by the input voltage source \nand the input capacitors, respectively. Neglecting inductor ripple current, the input capacitors source current of \namplitude (I OUT – I IN) during the D interval and sink I IN during the 1 – D interval. Thus, the input capacitors \nconduct a square-wave current of peak-to-peak amplitude equal to the output current. The resultant capacitive \ncomponent of AC ripple voltage is a triangular waveform. Together with the ESR-related ripple component, \nEquation 3  gives the peak-to-peak ripple voltage amplitude:\n\x0b \x0c OUT\nIN OUT ESR\nSW INI D 1 DV I RF C \x98 \x98 \x10\'  \x0e \x98\x98\n(3)\nEquation 4  gives the input capacitance required for a particular load current:\n\x0b \x0c\n\x0b \x0cOUT\nIN\nSW IN ESR OUTD 1 D ICF V R I\x98 \x10 \x98t\x98 \' \x10 \x98\n(4)\nwhere\n•ΔVIN is the input voltage ripple specification.\nThe TPSM63603  requires a minimum of 2 × 4.7 µF of ceramic type input capacitance. Only use high-quality \nceramic type capacitors with sufficient voltage and temperature rating. The ceramic input capacitors provide a \nlow impedance source to the converter in addition to supplying the ripple current and isolating switching noise \nfrom other circuits. Additional capacitance can be required for applications with transient load requirements. \nThe voltage rating of input capacitors must be greater than the maximum input voltage. To compensate for the \nderating of ceramic capacitors, TI recommends a voltage rating of twice the maximum input voltage or placing \nmultiple capacitors in parallel.

The switching frequency can easily \nbe set by connecting a resistor (R RT) between the RT pin and AGND. Use Equation 5  to calculate the R RT value \nfor a desired frequency or simply select from Table 7-4 . Note that a resistor value outside of the recommended \nrange can cause the device to shut down. This prevents unintended operation if RT pin is shorted to ground or \nleft open. Do not apply a pulsed signal to this pin to force synchronization.

Once the EN/SYNC pin voltage \nexceeds the threshold voltage and V IN is above the minimum turn-on threshold, the device starts operation. The \nsimplest way to enable the TPSM63603  is to connect EN/SYNC  directly to VIN. This allows the TPSM63603  to \nstart up when V IN is within its valid operating range. However, many applications benefit from the employment \nof an enable divider network as shown in Figure 7-3 , which establishes a precision input undervoltage lockout \n(UVLO). This can be used for sequencing, to prevent re-triggering the device when used with long input cables, \nor to reduce the occurrence of deep discharge of a battery power source. An external logic signal can also be \nused to drive the enable input to toggle the output on and off and for system sequencing or protection.\nEN/SYNCVIN\nRENT\nAGNDVIN\nRENB\nFigure 7-3. VIN UVLO Using the EN/SYNC  Pin\nRENB can be calculated using Equation 6 .\n(6)\nwhere\n•A typical value for R ENT is 100 kΩ.\n•VEN is 1.263 V (typical).\n•VIN(ON)  is the desired start-up input voltage.\nNote\nThe EN/SYNC pin can also be used as an external synchronization clock input. See Section 7.3.7  for \nadditional information. A blanking time of 4 µs to 28 µs is applied to the enable logic after a clock edge \nis detected. To effectively disable the output, the EN/SYNC input must stay low for longer than 28 µs. \nAny logic change within the blanking time is ignored. Blanking time is not applied when the device is in \nshutdown mode.www.ti.comTPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n7.3.7 Frequency Synchronization (EN/SYNC)\nThe TPSM63603  can be synchronized to an external clock using the EN/SYNC pin. The synchronization \nfrequency range is 200 kHz to 2.2 MHz. The internal oscillator can be synchronized by AC coupling a positive \nclock edge into the EN/SYNC pin, as shown in Figure 7-4 . It is recommended to keep the parallel combination \nvalue of R ENT and R ENB in the 100-k Ω range. R ENT is required for synchronization, but R ENB can be left open. \nThe external clock must be off before start-up to allow proper start-up sequencing. After a valid synchronization \nsignal is applied for 2048 cycles, the clock frequency changes to that of the applied signal.\nRENT\nRENBEN/SYNC\nAGNDVIN\nCSYNC\nAGNDClock \nSource \nFigure 7-4. Typical Synchronization Using the EN/SYNC Pin\nReferring to Figure 7-5 , the AC-coupled voltage edge at the EN/SYNC pin must exceed the SYNC amplitude \nthreshold, V EN_SYNC , of 2.4 V to trip the internal synchronization pulse detector. In addition, the minimum EN/\nSYNC rising pulse and falling pulse durations must be longer than the SYNC signal hold time, t SYNC_EDGE , of \n100 ns and shorter than the minimum blanking time, t B. A 3.3-V or higher amplitude pulse signal coupled through \na 1-nF capacitor, C SYNC, is suggested.\nVENEN Voltage\nt 0VEN_SYNC\ntSYNC_EDGE TimetSYNC_EDGE\nVEN_SYNC\nFigure 7-5. Typical SYNC Waveform\n7.3.8 Spread Spectrum\nSpread spectrum is a factory option included in part number TPSM63603S . The purpose of spread spectrum \nis to eliminate peak emissions at specific frequencies by spreading these peaks across a wider range of \nfrequencies than a part with fixed frequency operation. In most systems with the TPSM63603S , low-frequency \nconducted emissions from the first few harmonics of the switching frequency can be easily filtered. A more \ndifficult design criterion is reduction of emissions at higher harmonics that fall in the FM band. These harmonics \noften couple to the environment through electric fields around the switch node and inductor. The TPSM63603S \nuses a ±2% spread of frequencies that can spread energy smoothly across the FM and TV bands but is small \nenough to limit sub-harmonic emissions below the device switching frequency. Peak emissions at the module \nswitching frequency are only reduced slightly, by less than 1 dB, while peaks in the FM band are typically \nreduced by more than 6 dB.TPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\nThe TPSM63603S  uses a cycle-to-cycle frequency hopping method based on a linear feedback shift register \n(LFSR). This intelligent pseudo-random generator limits cycle to cycle frequency changes to limit output ripple. \nThe pseudo-random pattern repeats at less than 1.5 Hz, which is below the audio band.\nThe spread spectrum is only available while the clock of TPSM63603S  device are free running at their natural \nfrequency. Any of the following conditions overrides spread spectrum, turning it off:\n•The clock is slowed during dropout.\n•Spread spectrum is active even if there is no load.\n•At a high input voltage/low output voltage ratio when the device operates at minimum on-time, the internal \nclock is slowed, disabling spread spectrum.\n•The clock is synchronized with an external clock.\n7.3.9 Power Good Monitor (PG)\nThe TPSM63603  provides a PGOOD signal to indicate when the output voltage is within regulation. Use the \nPGOOD signal for output monitoring, fault protection, or start-up sequencing of downstream converters. The \nPGOOD pin voltage goes low when the feedback voltage is outside of the PGOOD thresholds. This occurs \nduring the following:\n•While the device is disabled\n•In current limit\n•In thermal shutdown\n•During normal start-up, when the output voltage has not reach its regulation value\nA glitch filter prevents false flag operation for short excursions (<120 µs typical) of the output voltage, such as \nduring line and load transients.\nPGOOD is an open-drain output that requires a pullup resistor to a DC supply not greater than 20 V. The typical \nrange of pullup resistance is 10 k Ω to 100 k Ω. When EN is pulled low, the flag output is also forced low. With EN \nlow, power good remains valid as long as the input voltage is above 1 V (typical). Use the PG signal for start-up \nsequencing of downstream regulators, as shown in Figure 7-6 , or for fault protection and output monitoring.\n10 FB14EN/SYNCRUV1\n1 M \x01VOUT1 = 5 V\nRFB1\nRFB240.2 k\x00\n10 k \x021 V 10FB14RPG\n100 k\x03RFB3\nRFB423.2 k\x04\n10 k \x051 VVOUT2 = 3.3 VVIN(on) = 13.9 V\nVIN(off) = 10 V\nRegulator #1\nStart-up based on \ninput voltage UVLO  Regulator #2 \nSequential start-up \nbased on PGPG 13 PG 13\nRUV2\n100 k\x06EN/SYNC\nFigure 7-6. TPSM63603  Sequencing Implementation Using PG and EN/SYNC \n7.3.10 Adjustable Switch-Node Slew Rate (RBOOT/CBOOT)\nAdjust the switch-node slew rate of the TPSM63603  to slow the switch-node voltage rise time and improve EMI \nperformance at high frequencies. However, slowing the rise time decreases efficiency. Care must be taken to \nbalance the improved EMI versus the decreased efficiency.\nInternal to the device, a bootstrap resistor of 100 Ω is connected between the RBOOT and CBOOT pins as \nshown in Figure 7-7 . Leaving these pins open incorporates the 100- Ω resistor in the BOOT circuit, slowing the \nSW voltage slew rate and optimizing EMI. However, if improved EMI is not required, connecting RBOOT to \nCBOOT shorts the internal resistor, resulting in higher efficiency. Placing a resistor across RBOOT and CBOOT \nallows adjustment of the internal resistor to balance EMI and efficiency.www.ti.comTPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n3CBOOT\n2SW100 ΩPower \nMOSFET \ngate driversRBOOT4\nCBOOT\n100 nFRBOOT7VCC\nCVCC\n1 µF\nFigure 7-7. Internal BOOT Resistor\n7.3.11 Internal LDO, VCC Output, and VLDOIN Input\nThe TPSM63603  has an internal LDO to power internal circuitry. The VCC pin is the output of the internal LDO. \nThis pin must not be used to power external circuitry. Connect a high-quality, 1- μF capacitor from this pin to \nAGND, close to the device pins. Do not load the VCC pin or short it to ground.\nThe VLDOIN pin is an optional input to the internal LDO. Connect an optional high quality 0.1-µF to 1-µF \ncapacitor from this pin to ground for improved noise immunity.\nThe LDO generates the VCC voltage from one of the two inputs: V IN or the VLDOIN input. When VLDOIN is tied \nto ground or below 3.1 V, the LDO is powered from V IN. When VLDOIN is tied to a voltage higher than 3.1 V, the \nLDO input is powered from VLDOIN. VLDOIN voltage must be lower than both V IN and 12.5 V.\nThe VLDOIN input is designed to reduce the LDO power loss. The LDO power loss is:\nPLDO-LOSS  = ILDO × (V IN_LDO  – V VCC) (7)\nThe higher the difference between the input and output voltages of the LDO, the more loss occurs to supply the \nsame LDO output current. The VLDOIN input provides an option to supply the LDO with a lower voltage than \nVIN, to reduce the difference of the input and output voltages of the LDO and reduce power loss. For example, if \nthe LDO current is 10 mA at a certain frequency with V IN = 24 V and V OUT = 5 V. The LDO loss with VLDOIN tied \nto ground is equal to 10 mA × (24 V – 3.3 V) = 207 mW, while the loss with VLDOIN tied to V OUT (5 V) is equal to \n10 mA × (5 V – 3.3 V) = 17 mW.\nThe efficiency improvement is more significant at light and mid loads because the LDO loss is a higher \npercentage of the total loss. The improvement is more significant with higher switching frequency because \nthe LDO current is higher at higher switching frequency. The improvement is more significant when V IN » V OUT \nbecause the voltage difference is higher.\nFigure 7-8  and Figure 7-9  show  typical efficiency waveforms with VLDOIN powered by different input voltages.TPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\nOutput Current (A)Efficiency (%)\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 36062646668707274767880828486889092949698100\nVLDOIN\n3.3V\n5V\nGNDVIN = 24 V VOUT = 5 V FSW = 1 MHz\nILDO = 10 mA\nFigure 7-8.

The current is compared every switching cycle to the current limit threshold. During an \novercurrent condition, the output voltage decreases.\nThe TPSM63603  employs hiccup overcurrent protection if there is an extreme overload. In hiccup mode, the \nregulator is shut down and kept off for 80 ms (typical) before the TPSM63603  tries to start again. If an \novercurrent or short-circuit fault condition still exists, hiccup repeats until the fault condition is removed. Hiccup \nmode reduces power dissipation under severe overcurrent conditions, and prevents overheating and potential \ndamage to the device. Once the fault is removed, the module automatically recovers and returns to normal \noperation.\n7.3.13 Thermal Shutdown\nThermal shutdown is an integrated self-protection used to limit junction temperature and prevent damage related \nto overheating. Thermal shutdown turns off the device when the junction temperature exceeds 168°C (typical) to \nprevent further power dissipation and temperature rise. Junction temperature decreases after shutdown, and the \nTPSM63603  attempts to restart when the junction temperature falls to 158°C (typical).\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Shutdown Mode\nThe EN/SYNC  pin provides ON and OFF control for the TPSM63603 . When VEN/SYNC  is below approximately 0.4 \nV, the device is in shutdown mode. Both the internal LDO and the switching regulator are off. The input quiescent \ncurrent in shutdown mode drops to 0.6 µA (typical). The TPSM63603  also employs internal undervoltage \nprotection. If the input voltage is below its UV threshold, the regulator remains off.\n7.4.2 Standby Mode\nThe internal LDO has a lower enable threshold than the regulator itself. When VEN/SYNC  is above 1.1 V \n(maximum) and below the precision enable threshold of 1.263 V (typical), the internal LDO is on and regulating. \nThe precision enable circuitry is turned on once the internal V CC is above its UVLO threshold. The switching \naction and voltage regulation are not enabled until V EN/SYNC  rises above the precision enable threshold.\n7.4.3 Active Mode\nThe TPSM63603  is in active mode when V IN and VEN/SYNC  are above their relevant thresholds and no fault \nconditions are present. The simplest way to enable the operation is to connect the EN/SYNC  pin to V IN, which \nallows self start-up when the applied input voltage exceeds the minimum start-up voltage.TPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n8 Applications and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

However, the integrated loop compensation is optimized for a certain range of output \ncapacitance.TPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n8.2.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n8.2.2.2.1 Output Voltage Setpoint\nThe output voltage of the TPSM63603  device is externally adjustable using a resistor divider. The recommended \nvalue of R FBB is 10 kΩ. Calculate the value for R FBT using Equation 9 :\n(9)\nFor the desired output voltage of – 5 V, enter the absolute value of 5 V for the V OUT in Equation 9 . The formula \nyields a value of 40.2 kΩ. Choose the closest available standard value of 40.2 kΩ for R FBT.\n8.2.2.2.2 IBB Maximum Output Current\nThe achievable output current with an IBB topology  using the TPSM63603  is I OUT(max)  = I LDC(max)  × (1 – D), \nwhere I LDC(max)  = 3 A is the rated current of the module and D = |V OUT| / (V IN + |V OUT|) is the module duty cycle. \nTherefore in the case of V IN = 12 V and the V OUT = –5 V, the maximum output current is 2.1 A.\n8.2.2.2.3 Switching Frequency Selection\nTo set the switching frequency to 1 MHz, connect a 13.0-k Ω resistor between the RT pin and AGND pins of the \nmodule based on Equation 5 .\n8.2.2.2.4 Input Capacitor Selection\nThe TPSM63603  requires a minimum input capacitance of 2 × 4.7-µF ceramic type between the VIN pins and \nPGND pins as close as possible to the module. High-quality ceramic type capacitors with sufficient voltage and \ntemperature rating are required. In the inverting buck-boost configuration the maximum voltage between VIN and \nPGND pin of the module is equal to V IN + |V OUT|.\nFor this design, two 4.7-µF, 50-V, 1210 case size, ceramic capacitors are selected.\n8.2.2.2.5 Output Capacitor Selection\nThe TPSM63603  requires a minimum of 25 µF of effective output capacitance for proper operation. High-\nquality ceramic type capacitors with sufficient voltage and temperature rating are required. Additional output \ncapacitance can be added to reduce ripple voltage or for applications with transient load requirements.\nFor this design example, a two 47-µF, 10-V, 1210 case size, ceramic capacitors are used which have a total \neffective capacitance of approximately 48 µF at 5 V.\n8.2.2.2.6 Other Connections\nShort RBOOT to CBOOT and connect VLDOIN to VOUT for best efficiency.\nPlace a 1-µF capacitor between the VCC pin and PGND, located near to the device.\nThe right-half-plane zero of an IBB topology is at its lowest frequency at minimum input voltage. However, it \ndoes not appear at low frequency for a –5 V output and thus has minimal effect on the loop response for this \napplication.\nIn the inverting buck-boost configuration, the input capacitor C IN and output capacitor C OUT can formed an AC \ncapacitive divider during a fast V IN transient or hot-plugged event at the input. This event will resulted in a \npositive voltage spike at the output that may disturb the load. In this case, an optional Schottky diode may be \ninstalled between –VOUT and GND as shown in Figure 8-12  to clamp the output spike.www.ti.comTPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 31\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n8.2.2.3 Application Curves\nUnless otherwise indicated, V IN = 12 V, V OUT = –5 V, and F SW = 1 MHz.\nLoad Current (A)Efficiency (%)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.8 26065707580859095\nVIN = 12 V\nVIN = 18 V\nVIN = 24 V\nFigure 8-13.

The \ncharacteristics of the input supply must be compatible with the Absolute Maximum Ratings  and Recommended \nOperating Conditions  in this data sheet. In addition, the input supply must be capable of delivering the required \ninput current to the loaded regulator circuit. Estimate the average input current with Equation 10 .\nK \x98\x98 \nINOUT OUT\nINVI VI\n(10)\nwhere\n•η = efficiency\nIf the module is connected to an input supply through long wires or PCB traces with a large impedance, take \nspecial care to achieve stable performance. The parasitic inductance and resistance of the input cables can \nhave an adverse affect on module operation. More specifically, the parasitic inductance in combination with the \nlow-ESR ceramic input capacitors form an underdamped resonant circuit, possibly resulting in instability, voltage \ntransients, or both, each time the input supply is cycled ON and OFF. The parasitic resistance causes the input \nvoltage to dip during a load transient. If the module is operating close to the minimum input voltage, this dip can \ncause false UVLO triggering and a system reset.\nThe best way to solve such issues is to reduce the distance from the input supply to the module and use an \nelectrolytic input capacitor in parallel with the ceramics. The moderate ESR of the electrolytic capacitor helps \ndamp the input resonant circuit and reduce any overshoot or undershoot at the input. A capacitance in the range \nof 47 μF to 100 μF is usually sufficient to provide input parallel damping and helps hold the input voltage steady \nduring large load transients. A typical ESR of 0.1 Ω to 0.4 Ω provides enough damping for most input circuit \nconfigurations.www.ti.comTPSM63603\nSLVSFS5A – OCTOBER 2021 – REVISED NOVEMBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: TPSM63603\n10 Layout\nThe performance of any switching power supply depends as much upon the layout of the PCB as the component \nselection. Use the following guidelines to design a PCB with the best power conversion performance, optimal \nthermal performance, and minimal generation of unwanted EMI.\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo achieve optimal electrical and thermal performance, an optimized PCB layout is required. Figure 10-1  and \nFigure 10-2  show a typical PCB layout. Some considerations for an optimized layout are:\n•Use large copper areas for power planes (VIN, VOUT, and PGND) to minimize conduction loss and thermal \nstress.\n•Place ceramic input and output capacitors close to the device pins to minimize high-frequency noise.\n•Locate additional output capacitors between the ceramic capacitors and the load.\n•Connect AGND to PGND at a single point.\n•Place R FBT and R FBB as close as possible to the FB pin.\n•Use multiple vias to connect the power planes to internal layers.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 10-1.
