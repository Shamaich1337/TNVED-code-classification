ADP7104  with Fixed Output Voltage, 5 V\nFigure 2. ADP7104  with Adjustable Output Voltage, 5 V\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADP7104  is a CMOS, low dropout linear regulator that oper-\nates from 3.3 V to 20 V and provides up to 500 mA of output\ncurrent. This high input voltage LDO is ideal for regulation of high\nperformance analog and mixed ‐signal circuits operating from 19\nV to 1.22 V rails. Using an advanced proprietary architecture, it\nprovides high power supply rejection, low noise, and achieves\nexcellent line and load transient response with just a small 1 µF\nceramic output capacitor.\nThe ADP7104  is available in seven fixed output voltage options and\nan adjustable version, which allows output voltages that range from\n1.22 V to VIN − VDO via an external feedback divider.\nThe ADP7104  output noise voltage is 15 μV rms and is independ-\nent of the output voltage. A digital power-good output allows power\nsystem monitors to check the health of the output voltage. A user\nprogrammable precision undervoltage lockout function facilitates\nsequencing of multiple power supplies.\nThe ADP7104  is available in 8-lead, 3 mm × 3 mm LFCSP  and\n8-lead SOIC  packages. The LFCSP offers a very compact solution\nand also provides excellent thermal performance for applications\nrequiring up to 500 mA of output current in a small, low profile\nfootprint.\nData Sheet ADP7104\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nanalog.com Rev.

Operation beyond the maximum operat-\ning conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.\nTHERMAL DATA\nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in combina-\ntion. The ADP7104  can be damaged when the junction temperature\nlimit is exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not guaran-\ntee that TJ is within the specified temperature limits. In applications\nwith high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maxi-\nmum ambient temperature may have to be derated.\nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low PCB ther-\nmal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature can exceed\nthe maximum limit as long as the junction temperature is within\nspecification limits. The junction temperature (TJ) of the device is\ndependent on the ambient temperature (TA), the power dissipation\nof the device (PD), and the junction-to-ambient thermal resistance\nof the package ( θJA).\nMaximum junction temperature (TJ) is calculated from the ambient\ntemperature (TA) and power dissipation (PD) using the formula\n     \nΤ J = Τ A + Ρ D × θ J A(1)\nJunction-to-ambient thermal resistance ( θJA) of the package is\nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer board. The\njunction-to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the\napplication and board layout. In applications where high maximum\npower dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design is\nrequired. The value of θJA may vary, depending on PCB material,\nlayout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θJA\nare based on a 4-layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit board. See JESD51-7\nand JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board construction.\nFor additional information, see the AN-617  Application Note.\nΨJB is the junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter\nwith units of °C/W.

ΨJB measures the component power flow-\ning through multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as\nin thermal resistance, θJB. Therefore, ΨJB thermal paths include\nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from\nthe package, factors that make ΨJB more useful in real-world\napplications.

Adjustable Output Voltage Internal Block Diagram\nInternally, the ADP7104  consists of a reference, an error amplifier,\nand a PMOS pass transistor. Output current is delivered via the\nPMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The\nerror amplifier compares the reference voltage with the feedback\nvoltage from the output and amplifies the difference. If the feedback\nvoltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS\ndevice is pulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing\nthe output voltage. If the feedback voltage is higher than the\nreference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher,\nallowing less current to pass and decreasing the output voltage.\nThe ADP7104  is available in seven fixed output voltage options,\nranging from 1.5 V to 9 V and in an adjustable version with an\noutput voltage that can be set to between 1.22 V and 19 V by an\nexternal voltage divider. The output voltage can be set according to\nthe following Equation 3 :\n     \nV OU T \xa0 = \xa01 . 22\xa0V 1 +R 1\nR 2(3)Figure 61. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic\nThe value of R2 must be less than 200 k Ω to minimize errors in the\noutput voltage caused by the ADJ pin input current. For example,\nwhen R1 and R2 each equal 200 k Ω, the output voltage is 2.44 V.\nThe output voltage error introduced by the ADJ pin input current is\n2 mV or 0.08%, assuming a typical ADJ pin input current of 10 nA\nat 25°C.\nThe ADP7104  uses the EN/UVLO pin to enable and disable\nthe VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When EN/UVLO is\nhigh, VOUT turns on, when EN is low, VOUT turns off. For automatic\nstart up, EN/UVLO can be tied to VIN.\nThe ADP7104  incorporates reverse current protections circuitry that\nprevents current flow backwards through the pass element when\nthe output voltage is greater than the input voltage. A compara-\ntor senses the difference between the input and output voltages.\nWhen the difference between the input voltage and output voltage\nexceeds 55 mV, the body of the PFET is switched to VOUT and\nturned off or opened. In other words, the gate is connected to VOUT.\nData Sheet ADP7104\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 17 of 26CAPACITOR SELECTION\nOutput Capacitor\nThe ADP7104  is designed for operation with small, space-saving\nceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used capaci-\ntors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective series\nresistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the\nstability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 1 µF capacitance\nwith an ESR of 1 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability\nof the ADP7104 . Transient response to changes in load current\nis also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of out-\nput capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP7104\nto large changes in load current. Figure 62  shows the transient\nresponses for an output capacitance value of 1 µF.\nFigure 62. Output Transient Response, VOUT = 1.8 V, COUT = 1 µF\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nConnecting a 1 µF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the circuit\nsensitivity to printed circuit board (PCB) layout, especially when\nlong input traces or high source impedance are encountered. If\ngreater than 1 µF of output capacitance is required, the input\ncapacitor should be increased to match it.\nInput and Output Capacitor Properties\nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the\nADP7104 , as long as they meet the minimum capacitance and\nmaximum ESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured\nwith a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over tem-\nperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric\nadequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary\ntemperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics\nwith a voltage rating of 6.3 V to 25 V are recommended. Y5V and\nZ5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor tempera-\nture and dc bias characteristics.\nFigure 63  depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristic\nof an 0402, 1 µF, 10 V, X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a\ncapacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltagerating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage\nrating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R\ndielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and\nis not a function of package or voltage rating.\nFigure 63. Capacitance vs. Voltage Characteristic\nUse Equation 4  to determine the worst-case capacitance account-\ning for capacitor variation over temperature, component tolerance,\nand voltage.\nC E F F = C BI A S × 1 − TE MPC O × 1 − TOL (4)\nwhere:\nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage.\nTEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient.\nTOL is the worst-case component tolerance.\nIn this example, the worst-case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO)\nover −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric.\nThe tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and\nCBIAS is 0.94 μF at 1.8 V, as shown in Figure 63 .\nSubstituting these values in Equation 5  yields\n     \nC EF F = 0 . 94 \xa0μF × 1 − 0 . 15 × 1 − 0 . 1 =\n0 . 719 \xa0μF(5)\nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the mini-\nmum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature and\ntolerance at the chosen output voltage.\nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP7104 , it is imperative that\nthe effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the behavior\nof the capacitors be evaluated for each application.\nPROGRAMMABLE UNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT\n(UVLO)\nThe ADP7104  uses the EN/UVLO pin to enable and disable the\nVOUT pin under normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure\n64, when a rising voltage on EN crosses the upper threshold,\nVOUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN/ UVLO crosses the\nData Sheet ADP7104\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 18 of 26lower threshold, VOUT turns off. The hysteresis of the EN/UVLO\nthreshold is determined by the Thevenin equivalent resistance in\nseries with the EN/UVLO pin.\nFigure 64. Typical VOUT Response to EN Pin Operation\nThe upper and lower thresholds are user programmable and can\nbe set using two resistors. When the EN/UVLO pin voltage is\nbelow 1.22 V, the LDO is disabled. When the EN/UVLO pin voltage\ntransitions above 1.22 V, the LDO is enabled and 10 µA hysteresis\ncurrent is sourced out the pin raising the voltage, thus providing\nthreshold hysteresis. Typically, two external resistors program the\nminimum operational voltage for the LDO. The resistance values,\nR1 and R2 can be determined from:\n     R 1 \xa0 = \xa0 V HYS / 10 \xa0μA\n     R 2 \xa0 = \xa01 . 22 \xa0 V \xa0 × \xa0 R 1 / V I N \xa0 − \xa01 . 22\xa0 V\nwhere:\nVIN is the desired turn-on voltage.\nVHYS is the desired EN/UVLO hysteresis level.\nHysteresis can also be achieved by connecting a resistor in series\nwith EN/UVLO pin. For the example shown in Figure 65 , the enable\nthreshold is 2.44 V with a hysteresis of 1 V.\nFigure 65. Typical EN Pin Voltage Divider\nFigure 64  shows the typical hysteresis of the EN/UVLO pin. This\nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN\npin as it passes through the threshold points.The ADP7104  uses an internal soft-start to limit the inrush current\nwhen the output is enabled. The start-up time for the 3.3 V option\nis approximately 580 μs from the time the EN active threshold is\ncrossed to when the output reaches 90% of its final value. As\nshown in Figure 66 , the start-up time is dependent on the output\nvoltage setting.\nFigure 66. Typical Start-Up Behavior\nPOWER-GOOD FEATURE\nThe ADP7104  provides a power-good pin (PG) to indicate the\nstatus of the output. This open-drain output requires an external\npull-up resistor to VIN or VOUT. If the part is in shutdown mode,\ncurrent-limit mode, or thermal shutdown, or if it falls below 90% of\nthe nominal output voltage, the power-good pin (PG) immediately\ntransitions low. During soft-start, the rising threshold of the power-\ngood signal is 93.5% of the nominal output voltage.\nThe open-drain output is held low when the ADP7104  has sufficient\ninput voltage to turn on the internal PG transistor. The PG transistor\nis terminated via a pull-up resistor to VOUT or VIN.\nPower-good accuracy is 93.5% of the nominal regulator output\nvoltage when this voltage is rising, with a 90% trip point when\nthis voltage is falling. Regulator input voltage brownouts or glitches\ntrigger power no good signals if VOUT falls below 90%.\nA normal power-down causes the power-good signal to go low\nwhen VOUT drops below 90%.\nFigure 67  and Figure 68  show the typical power-good rising and\nfalling threshold over temperature.\nData Sheet ADP7104\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 19 of 26Figure 67. Typical Power-Good Threshold vs. Temperature, VOUT Rising\nFigure 68. Typical Power-Good Threshold vs. Temperature, VOUT Falling\nNOISE REDUCTION OF THE ADJUSTABLE\nADP7104\nThe ultralow output noise of the fixed output ADP7104  is achieved\nby keeping the LDO error amplifier in unity gain and setting the\nreference voltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture\ndoes not work for an adjustable output voltage LDO. The adjustable\noutput ADP7104  uses the more conventional architecture where the\nreference voltage is fixed and the error amplifier gain is a function\nof the output voltage. The disadvantage of the conventional LDO\narchitecture is that the output voltage noise is proportional to the\noutput voltage.\nThe adjustable LDO circuit can be modified slightly to reduce the\noutput voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output\nADP7104 . The circuit shown in Figure 69  adds two additional\ncomponents to the output voltage setting resistor divider. CNR and\nRNR are added in parallel with RFB1 to reduce the ac gain of the\nerror amplifier. RNR is chosen to be equal to RFB2, this limits the ac\ngain of the error amplifier to approximately 6 dB. The actual gain\nis the parallel combination of RNR and RFB1 divided by RFB2. Thisensures that the error amplifier always operates at greater than\nunity gain.\nCNR is chosen by setting the reactance of CNR equal to RFB1 − RNR\nat a frequency between 50 Hz and 100 Hz. This sets the frequency\nwhere the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB down from its dc\ngain.\nFigure 69. Noise Reduction Modification to Adjustable LDO\nThe noise of the adjustable LDO can be found by using the\nfollowing formula, assuming the noise of a fixed output LDO is\napproximately 15 μV.\n     \n15 \xa0 μV × 1 +1\n1 / 13 \xa0 kΩ + 1 / 40.2 \xa0 kΩ/ 13 \xa0 kΩ(6)\nBased on the component values shown in Figure 69 , the ADP7104\nhas the following characteristics:\n►DC gain of 4.09 (12.2 dB)\n►3 dB roll-off frequency of 59 Hz\n►High frequency ac gain of 1.76 (4.89 dB)\n►Noise reduction factor of 1.33 (2.59 dB)\n►RMS noise of the adjustable LDO without noise reduction of\n27.8 µV rms\n►RMS noise of the adjustable LDO with noise reduction (assum-\ning 15 µV rms for fixed voltage option) of 19.95 µV rms\nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD\nPROTECTION\nThe ADP7104  is protected against damage due to excessive power\ndissipation by current and thermal overload protection circuits. The\nADP7104  is designed to current limit when the output load reaches\n775 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 775 mA, the output\nvoltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit.\nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the junction\ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme\nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power\ndissipation) when the junction temperature starts to rise above\n150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output current to zero.\nWhen the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is\nturned on again, and output current is restored to its operating\nvalue.\nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground occurs.\nAt first, the ADP7104  current limits, so that only 775 mA is conduct-\nData Sheet ADP7104\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. J | 20 of 26ed into the short. If self heating of the junction is great enough\nto cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown\nactivates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to\nzero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C,\nthe output turns on and conducts 775 mA into the short, again\ncausing the junction temperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal\noscillation between 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation\nbetween 775 mA and 0 mA that continues as long as the short\nremains at the output.\nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect the de-\nvice against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation,\ndevice power dissipation must be externally limited so the junction\ntemperature does not exceed 125°C.\nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn applications with low input-to-output voltage differential, the\nADP7104  does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications\nwith high ambient temperature and/or high input voltage, the heat\ndissipated in the package may become large enough that it causes\nthe junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction\ntemperature of 125°C.\nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter en-\nters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction tempera-\nture has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent dam-\nage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is very\nimportant to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions.\nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient\ntemperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the\npackage due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 7 .\nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the\nADP7104 > must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction\ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be\naware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature\nchanges. These parameters include ambient temperature, power\ndissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between\nthe junction and ambient air ( θJA). The θJA number is dependent on\nthe package assembly compounds that are used and the amount of\ncopper used to solder the package GND pins to the PCB.\nTable 6  shows typical θJA values of the 8-lead SOIC and 8-lead\nLFCSP packages for various PCB copper sizes.
