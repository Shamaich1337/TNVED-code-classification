H For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATIONThe LTM4622 is a dual output standalone non-isolated \nswitch mode DC/DC power supply. It can deliver two 2.5A \nDC, 3A peak output current with few external input and \noutput ceramic capacitors. This module provides dual \nprecisely regulated output voltage programmable via \ntwo external resistor from 0.6V to 5.5V over 3.6V to 20V input voltage range. With INTV\nCC tied to V IN, this module \nis able to operate from 3.3V input. The typical application schematic is shown in Figure\xa024.\nThe LTM4622 contains an integrated controlled on-time \nvalley current mode regulator , power MOSFETs, inductor , and other supporting discrete components. The default \nswitching frequency is 1MHz. For output voltages between \n2.5V and 5.5V, an external resistor is required between \nFREQ and GND pins to set the operating frequency to \nhigher frequency to optimize inductor current ripple. \nFor switching noise-sensitive applications, the switch -\ning frequency can be adjusted by external resistors and \nthe μModule regulator can be externally synchronized to a clock within ±30% of the set frequency. See the \nApplications Information section.\nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the LTM4622 module has sufficient stability margins and good transient performance with \na wide range of output capacitors, even with all ceramic output capacitors.\nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast cur -\nrent limiting. An internal overvoltage and undervoltage \ncomparators pull the open-drain PGOOD output low if \nthe output feedback voltage exits a ±8% window around \nthe regulation point. Furthermore, an input overvoltage \nprotection been utilized by shutting down both power \nMOSFETs when V IN rises above 22.5V to protect internal \ndevices.\nMultiphase operation can be easily employed by connect -\ning SYNC pin to an external oscillator . Up to 6 phases can \nbe paralleled to run simultaneously a good current sharing \nguaranteed by current mode control loop.\nPulling the RUN pin below 1V forces the controller into \nits shutdown state, turning off both power MOSFETs and \nmost of the internal control circuitry. At light load cur -\nrents, Burst Mode operation can be enabled to achieve \nhigher efficiency compared to continuous mode (CCM) by \nsetting MODE pin to INTV CC. The TRACK/SS pin is used \nfor power supply tracking and soft-start programming. \nSee the Applications Information section.\nThe typical LTM4622 application circuit is shown in \nFigure\xa024. External component selection is primarily deter -\nmined by the input voltage, the output voltage and the \nmaximum load current. Refer to Table\xa07 for specific exter -\nnal capacitor requirements for a particular application.\nVIN to V OUT Step-Down Ratios\nThere are restrictions in the maximum V IN and V OUT step \ndown ratio that can be achieved for a given input voltage \ndue to the minimum off-time and minimum on-time limits \nof the regulator . The minimum off-time limit imposes a \nmaximum duty cycle which can be calculated as\n  DMAX = 1 – t OFF(MIN)  • fSWwhere t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum off-time, 45ns typical for \nLTM4622, and f SW is the switching frequency. Conversely \nthe minimum on-time limit imposes a minimum duty \ncycle of the converter which can be calculated as\n \nDMIN = tON(MIN)  • fSW\nwhere t ON(MIN)  is the minimum on-time, 20ns typical for \nLTM4622. In the rare cases where the minimum duty \ncycle is surpassed, the output voltage will still remain \nin regulation, but the switching frequency will decrease from its programmed value.

In \nBurst Mode operation, a current reversal comparator \n(IREV) detects the negative inductor current and shuts off \nthe bottom power MOSFET , resulting in discontinuous \noperation and increased efficiency. Both power MOSFETs \nwill remain off and the output capacitor will supply the \nload current until the COMP voltage rises above the zero \ncurrent level to initiate another cycle.\nForce Continuous Current Mode (CCM) Operation\nIn applications where fixed frequency operation is more \ncritical than low current efficiency, and where the low -\nest output ripple is desired, forced continuous opera -\ntion should be used. Forced continuous operation can \nbe enabled by tying the SYNC/MODE pin to GND. In this \nmode, inductor current is allowed to reverse during low \noutput loads, the COMP voltage is in control of the current \ncomparator threshold throughout, and the top MOSFET always turns on with each oscillator pulse. During start-\nup, forced continuous mode is disabled and inductor \ncurrent is prevented from reversing until the LTM4622’s output voltage is in regulation.Output Voltage Programming\nThe PWM controller has an internal 0.6V reference volt -\nage.

The default \noperating frequency is internally set to 1MHz. In most appli -\ncations, no additional frequency adjusting is required.\nIf any operating frequency other than 1MHz is required by \napplication, the operating frequency can be increased by \nadding a resistor , R FSET, between the FREQ pin and GND, \nas shown in Figure\xa026.

This allows the internal top MOSFET turn-on to be \nlocked to the rising edge of the external clock. The exter -\nnal clock frequency range must be within ±30% around \nthe set operating frequency\n. A pulse detection circuit is \nused to detect a clock on the SYNC/MODE pin to turn \non the phase-locked loop. The pulse width of the clock \nhas to be at least 100ns . The clock high level must be \nabove 2V and clock low level below 0.3V. The presence \nof an external clock will place both regulator channels into \nforced continuous mode operation. During the start-up of \nthe regulator , the phase-locked loop function is disabled.\nMultiphase Operation\nFor output loads that demand more than 2.5A of current, \ntwo outputs in the LTM4622 or even multiple LTM4622s \ncan be paralleled to run out of phase to provide more \noutput current without increasing input and output volt-\nage ripples.\nA multiphase power supply significantly reduces the \namount of ripple current in both the input and output \ncapacitors. The RMS input ripple current is reduced by, \nand the effective ripple frequency is multiplied by, the \nnumber of phases used (assuming that the input voltage is greater than the number of phases used times the out -\nput voltage). The output ripple amplitude is also reduced \nby the number of phases used when all of the outputs \nare tied together to achieve a single high output current design.\nThe two switching mode regulator channels inside the \nLTM4622 are internally set to operate 180° out of phase. \nMultiple LTM4622s could easily operate 90 degrees, 60 degrees or 45 degrees shift which corresponds to \n4-phase, 6-phase or 8-phase operation by letting SYNC/MODE of the LTM4622 synchronize to an external multi -\nphase oscillator like L TC\n®6902.

A \ncapacitor on the TRACK/SS pin will program the ramp \nrate of the output voltage. An internal 1.4µA current \nsource will charge up the external soft-start capacitor \ntowards INTV CC voltage. When the TRACK/SS voltage is \nbelow 0.6V, it will take over the internal 0.6V reference \nvoltage to control the output voltage. The total soft-start time can be calculated as:\n  tSS= 0.6 •CSS\n1.4µA\nwhere C SS is the capacitance on the TRACK/SS pin. \nCurrent foldback and force continuous mode are disabled \nduring the soft-start process.\nThe LTM4622  has internal 400 μs soft-start time when \nTRACK/SS leave floating.\nOutput voltage tracking can also be programmed \nexternally using the TRACK/SS pin.

From the equation, we \ncould solve out that R TR(TOP)  =\xa060.4k and R TR(BOT)  = 40.2k  \nis a good combination for the Ratiometric tracking.\nThe TRACK pins will have the 1.5µA current source on \nwhen a resistive divider is used to implement tracking on \nthat specific channel.

A resistor can \nbe pulled up to a particular supply voltage for monitoring. \nTo prevent unwanted PGOOD glitches during transients \nor dynamic V OUT changes, the LTM4622’s PGOOD falling \nedge includes a blanking delay of approximately 40µs.\nStability compensation\nThe LTM4622 module internal compensation loop is \ndesigned and optimized for low ESR ceramic output \ncapacitors only application. Table\xa07 is provided for most application requirements. The L TpowerCAD Design Tool is available to down for control loop optimization.\nRUN Enable\nPulling the RUN pin to ground forces the LTM4622 into \nits shutdown state, turning off both power MOSFETs and most of its internal control circuitry. T rying the RUN pin voltage above 1.27V will turn on the entire chip.\nLow Input Application\nThe LTM4622 is capable to run from 3.3V input when \nthe V IN pin is tied to INTV CC pin. See Figure\xa027 for the \napplication circuit. Please note the INTV CC pin has 3.6V \nABS MAX voltage rating.Pre-Biased Output Start-Up\nThere may be situations that require the power supply to \nstart up with a pre-bias on the output capacitors. In this case, it is desirable to start up without discharging that output pre-bias. The LTM4622 can safely power up into a pre-biased output without discharging it.\nThe LTM4622 accomplishes this by forcing discontinuous \nmode (DCM) operation until the TRACK/SS pin voltage \nreaches 0.6V reference voltage. This will prevent the BG \nfrom turning on during the pre-biased output start-up \nwhich would discharge the output. \nOvertemperature Protection\nThe internal overtemperature protection monitors the \njunction temperature of the module. If the junction \ntemperature reaches approximately 160°C , both power \nswitches will be turned off until the temperature drops \nabout 15°C cooler .\nInput Overvoltage Protection\nIn order to protect the internal power MOSFET devices \nagainst transient voltage spikes, the LTM4622 constantly \nmonitors each V IN pin for an overvoltage condition. When \nVIN rises above 22.5V, the regulator suspends operation \nby shutting off both power MOSFETs on the correspond -\ning channel. Once V IN drops below 21.5V, the regulator \nimmediately resumes normal operation. The regulator \nexecutes its soft-start function when exiting an overvolt -\nage condition.Thermal Considerations and Output Current Derating\nThe thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configuration \nsection of the data sheet are consistent with those param-\neters defined by JESD51-9 and are intended for use with \nfinite element analysis (FEA) software modeling tools \nthat leverage the outcome of thermal modeling, simula -\ntion, and correlation to hardware evaluation performed \non a µModule package mounted to a hardware test \nLTM4622\n15\nRev.

Without FEA software, the thermal resistances reported in the \nPin Configuration section are in-and-of themselves not \nrelevant to providing guidance of thermal performance; \ninstead, the derating curves provided in the data sheet can \nbe used in a manner that yields insight and guidance per -\ntaining to one’s application usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal per\nformance to one’s own application.\nThe Pin Configuration section typically gives four thermal \ncoefficients explicitly defined in JESD 51-12; these coef-\nficients are quoted or paraphrased below:\n1.\n θJA, the thermal resistance from junction to ambient, \nis the natural convection junction-to-ambient air ther -\nmal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed \nenclosure. This environment is sometimes referred \nto as still air although natural convection causes the \nair to move. This value is determined with the part \nmounted to a JESD 51-9 defined test board, which \ndoes not reflect an actual application or viable operat -\ning condition.2. θJCbottom , the thermal resistance from junction to \nambient, is the natural convection junction-to-ambi -\nent air thermal resistance measured in a one cubic \nfoot sealed enclosure. This environment is sometimes \nreferred to as still air although natural convection \ncauses the air to move. This value is determined with \nthe part mounted to a JESD 51-9 defined test board, which does not reflect an actual application or viable operating condition.\n3.\n θJCtop, the thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the \ncomponent power dissipation flowing through the top \nof the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of \nthe heat flows from the junction to the top of the part. \nAs in the case of θJCbottom , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n4. θJB, the thermal resistance from junction to the \nprinted circuit board, is the junction-to-board thermal \nresistance where almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule and into the board, and \nis really the sum of the θ JCbottom  and the thermal \nresistance of the bottom of the part through the solder \njoints and through a portion of the board. The board \ntemperature is measured a specified distance from \nthe package, using a two sided, two layer board. This board is described in JESD 51-9.Figure\xa07.

For example, in nor -\nmal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of \nthe device’ s total power loss (heat) thermally conduct \nexclusively through the top or exclusively through bottom \nof the µModule—as the standard defines for θ JCtop and \nθJCbottom , respectively. In practice, power loss is ther -\nmally dissipated in both directions away from the pack -\nage—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nWithin a SIP (system-in-package) module, be aware there \nare multiple power devices and components dissipating power , with a consequence that the thermal resistances \nrelative to different junctions of components or die are not \nexactly linear with respect to total package power loss. To \nreconcile this complication without sacrificing modeling simplicity—but also, not ignoring practical realities—an \napproach has been taken using FEA software modeling \nalong with laboratory testing in a controlled-environment chamber to reasonably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in this data sheet: (1) Initially, FEA software is used to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the µModule and the specified PCB with all \nof the correct material coefficients along with accurate \npower loss source definitions; (2) this model simulates \na software-defined JEDEC environment consistent with \nJSED51-12 to predict power loss heat flow and tempera -\nture readings at different interfaces that enable the cal -\nculation of the JEDEC-defined thermal resistance values; (3) the model and FEA software is used to evaluate the \nµModule with heat sink and airflow;  (4) having solved \nfor and analyzed these thermal resistance values and \nsimulated various operating conditions in the software \nmodel, a thorough laboratory evaluation replicates the \nsimulated conditions with thermo-couples within a con -\ntrolled-environment chamber while operating the device at the same power loss as that which was simulated. An \noutcome of this process and due-diligence yields a set \nof derating curves provided in other sections of this data \nsheet. After these laboratory test have been performed \nand correlated to the µModule model, then the θ JB and \nθBA are summed together to correlate quite well with the \nµModule model with no airflow or heat sinking in a prop -\nerly define chamber .

H For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nflows from the junction through the board into ambient \nwith no airflow or top mounted heat sink.\nThe 1V, 1.5V, 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V power loss curves in \nFigures 8 to 12 can be used in coordination with the \nload current derating curves in Figures 13 to 21 for cal-\nculating an approximate θ JA thermal resistance for the \nLTM4622 (in two-phase single output operation) with no heat sinking and various airflow conditions. The \npower loss curves are taken at room temperature, and \nare increased with multiplicative factors of 1.35 assum-\ning junction temperature at 120°C. The derating curves \nare plotted with the output current starting at \n5A and the \nambient temperature at 40°C. These output voltages are \nchosen to include the lower and higher output voltage \nranges for correlating the thermal resistance. Thermal \nmodels are derived from several temperature measure -\nments in a controlled temperature chamber along with \nthermal modeling analysis. The junction temperatures \nare monitored while ambient temperature is increased \nwith and without airflow. The power loss increase with \nambient temperature change is factored into the derating curves. The junctions are maintained at 120°C maximum while lowering output current or power with increasing ambient temperature. The decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient tempera -\nture is increased. The monitored junction temperature of \n120°C  minus the ambient operating temperature specifies how much module temperature rise can be allowed. As an \nexample in Figure\xa015 the load current is derated to ~3A at ~102°C with no air or heat sink and the power loss for the 5V to 1.5V at 3A output is about 0.95W. The 0.95W loss is calculated with the ~0.7W room temperature loss from the 5V to 1.5V power loss curve at 3A, and the 1.35 \nmultiplying factor . If the 102°C  ambient temperature is \nsubtracted from the 120°C  junction temperature, then the \ndifference of 18°C  divided by 0.95W equals a 19°C /W θJA \nthermal resistance. Table\xa03 specifies a 19 – 20°C/W value which is very close. Table\xa02 to 6 provide equivalent ther -\nmal resistances for 1V, 1.5V\n , 2.5V, 3.3V and 5V outputs \nwith and without airflow. The derived thermal resistances \nin Table\xa02 to 6 for the various conditions can be multiplied \nby the calculated power loss as a function of ambient \ntemperature to derive temperature rise above ambient, \nthus maximum junction temperature. Room temperature \npower loss can be derived from the efficiency curves \nin the Typical Performance Characteristics section and \nadjusted with the above ambient temperature multiplica -\ntive factors. The printed circuit board is a 1.6mm thick \nfour layer board with two ounce copper for the two outer \nlayers and one ounce copper for the two inner layers. The \nPCB dimensions are 95mm × 76mm.\nFigure\xa022 shows a measured temperature picture of the \nLTM4622 with no heatsink and no airflow, from 12V input \ndown to 3.3V and 5V  output with 2.5A  DC current on each.\nFigure\xa022.

H For more information www.analog.comSAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\nThe LTM4622 modules do not provide galvanic isolation \nfrom V IN to V OUT. There is no internal fuse. If required, \na slow blow fuse with a rating twice the maximum input \ncurrent needs to be provided to protect each unit from \ncatastrophic failure. The device does support thermal \nshutdown and over current protection.\nLAYOUT CHECKLIST/EXAMPLE\nThe high integration of LTM4622 makes the PCB board \nlayout very simple and easy. However , to optimize its \nelectrical and thermal performance, some layout consid -\nerations are still necessary.\n nUse large PCB copper areas for high current paths, \nincluding V IN, GND, V OUT1 and V OUT2. It helps to \nminimize the PCB conduction loss and thermal stress.\n nPlace high frequency ceramic input and output capacitors next to the V\nIN, PGND and V OUT pins to \nminimize high frequency noise.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n nPlace a dedicated power ground layer underneath the unit.\n nTo minimize the via conduction loss and reduce module thermal stress, use multiple vias for interconnection between top layer and other power layers.\n nDo not put via directly on the pad, unless they are capped or plated over .\n nUse a separated SGND ground copper area for components connected to signal pins. Connect the SGND to GND underneath the unit.\n nFor parallel modules, tie the V OUT, VFB, and COMP \npins together . Use an internal layer to closely con -\nnect these pins together . The TRACK pin can be tied a common capacitor for regulator soft-start.\n nBring out test points on the signal pins for monitoring.\nFigure\xa023 gives a good example of the recommended \nlayout.\nFigure\xa023.
