This high output current LDO is ideal for regulation of \nhigh performance analog and mixed signal circuits operating \nfrom 6 V down to 1.2 V rails. Using an advanced proprietary architecture, the device provides high power supply rejection and low noise, and achieves excellent line and load transient response with just a small 4.7 μF ceramic output capacitor. Load transient response is typically 1.5 μs for a 1 mA to 500 mA load step. \nThe ADM7171  is available in 17 fixed output voltage options. \nThe following voltages are available from stock: 1.3 V , 1.8 V , \n2.5 V , 3.0 V , 3.3 V , 4.2 V , and 5.0 V . Additional voltages that are available by special order are: 1.5 V , 1.85 V , 2.0 V , 2.2 V , 2.7 V , 2.75 V , 2.8 V , 2.85 V , 3.8 V , and 4.6 V . An adjustable version is also available that allows output voltages that range from 1.2 V to V\nIN − V DO with an external feedback divider. \nInrush current can be controlled by adjusting the start-up time \nvia the soft start pin. The typical start-up time with a 1 nF soft \nstart capacitor is 1.0 ms.

This is a stress rating only; functional operation of the product at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond \nthe maximum operating conditions for extended periods may \naffect product reliability. \nTHERMAL DATA \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in combination. The ADM7171  can be damaged when the junction \ntemperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not guarantee that T\nJ is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may \nneed to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed \ncircuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient \ntemperature can exceed the maximum limit provided that the junction temperature is within specification limits. The junction temperature (T\nJ) of the device is dependent on the ambient \ntemperature (T A), the power dissipation of the device (P D), and \nthe junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of the package (θ JA).  \nMaximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated from the \nambient temperature (T A) and power dissipation (P D) using the \nformula \nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) \nJunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (θ JA) of the package is \nbased on modeling and calculation using a 4-layer board. The junction-to-ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the application and board layout. In applications where high \nmaximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal \nboard design is required. The value of θ\nJA may vary, depending on PCB material, layout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θ\nJA are based on a 4-layer, 4 in. × 3 in. circuit board. See \nJESD51-7 and JESD51-9 for detailed information on the board construction. For additional information, see the AN-617 \nApplication Note , Wafer Level Chip Scale Package , available at \nwww.analog.com . \nΨ\nJB is the junction-to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W . Ψ JB of the package is based on modeling and \ncalculation using a 4-layer board. The JESD51-12, Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , \nstates that thermal characterization parameters are not the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component power flowing \nthrough multiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal resistance, θ\nJB. Therefore, Ψ JB thermal paths include \nconvection from the top of the package as well as radiation from the package, factors that make Ψ\nJB more useful in real-world \napplications. Maximum junction temperature (T J) is calculated \nfrom the board temperature (T B) and power dissipation (P D) \nusing the formula  \nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB) \nSee JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information about Ψ\nJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE \nθJA, θJC, and Ψ JB are specified for the worst case conditions, that \nis, a device soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages. \nTable 5.

E | Page 16 of 23 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADM7171  is a low quiescent current, low dropout linear \nregulator that operates from 2.3 V to 6.5 V and provides up to \n1 A of load current. Drawing a low 4.0 mA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADM7171  ideal for portable \nequipment. Typical shutdown current consumption is 0.25 μA at room temperature. \nOptimized for use with small 4.7 μF ceramic capacitors, the \nADM7171  provides excellent transient performance. \nVOUT\nSENSE\nSSGNDCURRENT-LIMIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECT\nSOFT STARTREFERENCE\nSHUTDOWN ENVIN\n12298-056 \nFigure 54. Internal Block Diagram  \nInternally, the ADM7171  consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, a feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output current is delivered via the PMOS pass device, which is controlled by the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares \nthe reference voltage with the feedback voltage from the output \nand amplifies the difference. When the feedback voltage is lower than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing more current to pass and increasing the output voltage. When the feedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, \nallowing less current to pass and decreasing the output voltage. The ADM7171  is available in 17 fixed output voltage options, \nranging from 1.2 V to 5 V . The ADM7171  architecture allows \nany fixed output voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an \nexternal voltage divider. For example, a fixed 5 V output \nADM7171  can be set to a 6 V output according to the following \nequation: \nV\nOUT = 5 V(1 + R1/R2) \nVOUT\nSENSEVINADM7171\nGNDVIN VOUT\nSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 6.5V VOUT = 6.0V\nR1\n2kΩ\nR210kΩ\n12298-057 \nFigure 55. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic  \nUse a value of less than 200 kΩ for R2 to minimize errors in the \noutput voltage caused by the SENSE pin input current. For example, when R1 and R2 each equal 200 kΩ and the default output voltage is 1.2 V , the adjusted output voltage is 2.4 V . The \noutput voltage error introduced by the SENSE pin input current is \n0.1 mV or 0.004%, assuming a typical SENSE pin input bias current of 1 nA at 25°C. \nThe ADM7171  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npins under normal operating conditions. When EN is high, V\nOUT \nturns on, when EN is low, V OUT turns off. For automatic startup, \ntie EN to VIN (Pin 7 or Pin 8). \n \n \nData Sheet ADM7171\n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 23 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nADIsimPOWER DESIGN TOOL \nThe ADM7171  is supported by the ADIsimPower™ design tool \nset. ADIsimPower is a collection of tools that produce complete \npower designs optimized for a specific design goal. The tools enable the user to generate a full schematic, bill of materials, \nand calculate performance in minutes. ADIsimPower can optimize \ndesigns for cost, area, efficiency, and parts count, taking into consideration the operating conditions and limitations of the IC and all real external components. For more information about, and to obtain ADIsimPower design tools, visit www.analog.com/ADIsimPower . \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nMultilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) combine small size, low effective series resistance (ESR), low ESL, and wide operating \ntemperature range, making them an ideal choice for bypass \ncapacitors. They are not without limitations, however. Depending on the dielectric material, the capacitance can vary dramatically with temperature, dc bias, and ac signal level. Therefore, selecting the proper capacitor results in the best circuit performance. \nOutput Capacitor \nThe ADM7171  is designed for operation with small, space-\nsaving ceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used capacitors as long as care is taken with regard to the ESR value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 4.7 μF capacitance with an \nESR of 0.05 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability of the \nADM7171 . Transient response to changes in load current is also \naffected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of output capacitance improves the transient response of the ADM7171  to \nlarge changes in load current. Figure 56 shows the transient \nresponses for an output capacitance value of 4.7 μF. \n12298-058CH1  500mA BWCH2  20mV BWM4.0µs A  CH1      570mA\nT  10.4%T\n1\n2\n \nFigure 56. Output Transient Response, V OUT = 5 V, C OUT = 4.7 μF \nInput Bypass Capacitor \nConnecting a 4.7 μF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the \ncircuit sensitivity to PCB layout, especially when long input \ntraces or a high source impedance is encountered. If greater than 4.7 μF of output capacitance is required, increase the input \ncapacitor to match it. \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the ADM7171  if they meet the minimum capacitance and maximum \nESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature and applied voltage. Capacitors require a dielectric adequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a \nvoltage rating of 6.3 V to 100 V are recommended. Y5V and \nZ5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor temperature and dc bias characteristics. \nFigure 57 depicts the capacitance vs. dc bias voltage of a 0805, \n4.7 μF, 16 V , X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage rating \nexhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R \ndielectric is ~±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature range and is not a function of package or voltage rating. \nCAPACITANCE (µF)\nDC BIAS VOLTAGE (V)20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 000.51.01.52.02.53.03.54.04.55.0\n12298-059 \nFigure 57. Capacitance vs. DC Bias Voltage \nUse Equation 1 to determine the worst case capacitance accounting \nfor capacitor variation over temperature, component tolerance, \nand voltage. \nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL) (1) \nwhere: C\nBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage. \nTEMPCO  is the worst case capacitor temperature coefficient. \nTOL  is the worst case component tolerance. \nIn this example, the worst case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO) over −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric. \nThe tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and \nC\nBIAS is 4.35 μF at 3.0 V , as shown in Figure 57. \nSubstituting these values in Equation 1 yields \nCEFF = 4.35 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 3.33 μF \nADM7171 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 23 Therefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temper-ature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage of 3.0 V . \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADM7171 , it is imperative \nthat the effects of dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the \nbehavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each application. \nPROGRAMMABLE PRECISION ENABLE \nThe ADM7171  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT \npins under normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure 58, \nwhen a rising voltage on EN crosses the upper threshold, \ntypically 1.2 V , V OUT turns on. When a falling voltage on EN \ncrosses the lower threshold, typically 1.1 V , V OUT turns off. The \nhysteresis of the EN threshold is approximately 100 mV . \nVOUT (V)\nVEN (V)1.30 1.25 1.20 1.15 1.10 1.05 1.0000.51.01.52.02.53.0\n12298-060 \nFigure 58. Typical V OUT Response to EN Pin Operation \nThe upper and lower thresholds are user programmable and can \nbe set higher than the nominal 1.2 V threshold by using two \nresistors. The resistance values, R EN1 and R EN2, can be \ndetermined from \nREN1 = REN2 × (VIN − 1.2 V)/1.2 V \nwhere: R\nEN2 is nominally 10 kΩ to 100 kΩ. \nVIN is the desired turn-on voltage. \nThe hysteresis voltage increases by the factor  \n(REN1 + REN2)/REN1 \nFor the example shown in Figure 59, the enable threshold is \n3.6 V with a hysteresis of 300 mV . \nVOUT\nSENSEVIN\nENADM7171\nGNDCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µF\nOFFONVOUT = 5.0V VIN = 6.0V\nREN1\n200kΩ\nREN2\n100kΩ\n12298-061VOUT VIN\n \nFigure 59. Typical EN Pin Voltage Divider Figure 58 shows the typical hysteresis of the EN pin. This \nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise  on the EN pin as it passes through the threshold points. \nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT \nThe ADM7171  also incorporates an internal undervoltage \nlockout circuit to disable the output voltage when the input voltage is less than the minimum input voltage rating of the \nregulator. The upper and lower thresholds are internally fixed \nwith about 200 mV of hysteresis. This hysteresis prevents on/off oscillations that can occur when caused by noise on the input voltage as it passes through the threshold points. \nSOFT START \nThe ADM7171  uses an internal soft start (SS pin open) to limit the \ninrush current when the output is enabled. The start-up time for the 5.0 V option is approximately 380 μs from the time the EN active threshold is crossed to when the output reaches 90% of its \nfinal value. As shown in Figure 60, the start-up time is nearly \nindependent of the output voltage setting. \nVOUT (V)\nTIME (ms)1.0 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 000.51.02.03.04.05.0\n1.52.53.54.5VEN\n2.5V\n3.0V\n5.0V\n12298-062 \nFigure 60.

The SS pin can be left open for a typical 380 μs start-up time. Do not ground this pin. When an external soft start capacitor is used, the soft start time is determined by the \nfollowing equation: \nSS\nTIME (sec) = tSTART-UP at 0 nF + (0.6 × CSS)/ISS \nwhere: t\nSTART-UP at 0 nF  is the start-up time at C SS = 0 nF (typically 380 μs). \nCSS is the soft start capacitor (F). \nISS is the soft start current (typically 1 μA). \nVOUT (V)\nTIME (ms)10 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 000.51.02.03.03.5\n1.52.5\nVEN\nNO C SS\n1nF\n4.7nF\n10nF\n12298-063 \nFigure 61. Typical Soft Start Behavior, Different C SS Values \nNOISE REDUCTION OF THE ADM7171 IN \nADJUSTABLE MODE \nThe ultralow output noise of the ADM7171  is achieved by \nkeeping the LDO error amplifier in unity gain and setting the \nreference voltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture does not work for an adjustable output voltage LDO in the conventional sense. However, the ADM7171  architecture allows \nany fixed output voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an \nexternal voltage divider. For example, the adjustable (1.2 V in \nunity gain) output ADM7171  can be set to a 6 V output \naccording to the following equation: \nV\nOUT = 1.2 V(1 + R1/R2) \nThe disadvantage of using the ADM7171  in this manner is that \nthe output voltage noise is proportional to the output voltage. Therefore, it is best to choose a fixed output voltage that is close \nto the target voltage to minimize the increase in output noise. \nThe adjustable LDO circuit can be modified to reduce the \noutput voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output \nADM7171 . The circuit shown in Figure 62 adds two additional \ncomponents to the output voltage setting resistor divider. C\nNR \nand R NR are added in parallel with R FB1 to reduce the ac gain of \nthe error amplifier. R NR is chosen to be small with respect to R FB2. If \nRNR is 1% to 10% of the value of R FB2, the minimum ac gain of \nthe error amplifier is approximately 0.1 dB to 0.8 dB. The actual gain is determined by the parallel combination of R\nNR and R FB1. \nThis ensures that the error amplifier always operates at slightly greater than unity gain. C\nNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R FB1 −  \nRNR at a frequency between 0.5 Hz and 10 Hz. This sets the \nfrequency where the ac gain of the error amplifier is 3 dB  less than its dc gain. \nVOUT\nSENSEVINADM7171\nGNDVIN VOUT\nSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n4.7µFCOUT\n4.7µFCNR\n1µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 6.5V VOUT = 6.0V\nRFB1\n200kΩ\nRFB2\n50kΩRNR\n5kΩ\n12298-064 \nFigure 62. Noise Reduction Modification \nAssuming the noise of a fixed output LDO is approximately 5 μV , identify the noise of the adjustable LDO by using the following formula: \nNoise  = 5 μV × (R\nPAR + RFB2)/RFB2 \nwhere RPAR is the parallel combination of RFB1 and RNR. \nBased on the component values shown in Figure 62, the ADM7171  has the following characteristics: \n\uf0b7 DC gain of 5 (14 dB) \n\uf0b7 3 dB roll-off frequency of 0.8 Hz \n\uf0b7 High frequency ac gain of 1.09 (0.75 dB) \n\uf0b7 Noise reduction factor of 4.42 (12.91 dB) \n\uf0b7 RMS noise of the adjustable LDO without noise reduction of 25 μV rms \n\uf0b7 RMS noise of the adjustable LDO with noise reduction \n(assuming 5 μV rms for fixed voltage option) of 5.5 μV rms \nEFFECT OF NOISE REDUCTION ON START-UP TIME \nThe start-up time of the ADM7171  is affected by the noise \nreduction network and must be considered in applications \nwherein power supply sequencing is critical. \nThe noise reduction circuit adds a pole in the feedback loop that \nslows down the start-up time. The start-up time for an adjustable model with a noise reduction network can be approximated \nusing the following equation: \nSSNR\nTIME (sec) = 5.5 × CNR × (RNR + RFB1) \nFor a C NR, R NR, and R FB1 combination of 1 μF, 5 kΩ, and 200 kΩ, \nrespectively, as shown in Figure 62, the start-up time is \napproximately 1.1 seconds. When SSNR TIME is greater than \nSSTIME, it dictates the length of the start-up time instead of the \nsoft start capacitor. \nCURRENT-LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADM7171  is protected against damage due to excessive \npower dissipation by current-limit and thermal overload \nprotection circuits. The ADM7171  is designed to current limit \nwhen the output load reaches 3 A (typical). When the output load exceeds 3 A, the output voltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit. \nADM7171 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 20 of 23 Thermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature and/or high power dissipation) when the junction temperature starts to \nrise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the output \ncurrent to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and the output current is restored to its operating value. \nConsider the case where a hard short from VOUT to ground \noccurs. At first, the ADM7171  current limits, so that only 3 A is \nconducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is great \nenough to cause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal \nshutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C, the output turns on and conducts 3 A into the short, again causing the junction temperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C causes a current \noscillation between 3 A and 0 mA that continues for as long as \nthe short remains at the output. \nCurrent-limit and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally limited so that the junction temperature does not exceed 125°C. \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS \nIn applications with low input-to-output voltage differential, the ADM7171  does not dissipate much heat. However, in applications \nwith high ambient temperature and/or high input voltage, the  \nheat dissipated in the package may become large enough that  \nit causes the junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction temperature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent damage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application \nis very important to guarantee reliable performance over all \nconditions. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient temperature of the environment and the tempera-ture rise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2. \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the \nADM7171  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction \ntemperature stays below this maximum value, the user must be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature changes. These parameters include ambient temperature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). The θ JA number is dependent \non the package assembly compounds that are used and the amount of copper used to solder the package GND pin to the PCB. \nTable 7 shows typical θ\nJA values of the 8-lead LFCSP package for \nvarious PCB copper sizes. The typical value of Ψ JB is 15.1°C/W for \nthe 8-lead LFCSP package. Table 7.

Therefore, the junction temperature equation \nsimplifies to the following: \nTJ = TA + ((( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD) × θJA) (4) \nAs shown in Equation 4, for a given ambient temperature, input- \nto-output voltage differential, and continuous load current, a minimum copper size requirement exists for the PCB to ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C.
