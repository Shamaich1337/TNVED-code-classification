The XADC header provides a means to connect the analog inputs of the XADC to \nthe AMS101 evaluation card circuitry as well as providing a reference, power, and DAC control signals. Figure 3-2  shows the pinout and signal names for the XADC header on the \nFPGA base board.\nAs mentioned, the XADC header on the FPGA  base board and the 20-pin header on the \nAMS101 evaluation card are both keyed. To ensure correct connectivity, the keys must be properly aligned between the AMS101 evaluation  card and the XADC header.

See Signal Source Configuration, page 40  for \nmore details.\nSignal Conditioning Circuitry\nThe signal conditioning function of the AMS 101 evaluation card consists of an AD8033, \nwhich functions as a gain of 2 amplifier, su pplying 2.5V to the reference voltage to the \nDAC. \nPower Supplies\nThe circuitry on the AMS101 evaluation card receives 5V power through the FPGA base board across the XADC header.\nBoard Setup\nBecause of the level of flexibility of the XA DC, there are a three operating modes supported \nby the AMS101 evaluation card. Table 3-1  details these operating modes:\n\x81 Onboard DAC signal source (for AC or DC measurements) \n\x81 External single-ended source\n\x81 Fully differential signal source\nUse Case 1—On-Board DAC (Default)\nThis is the most common use case and the defaul t factory configuration of the board. In this \nmode, each output of the DAC is presented to  the three input channels available on the \nanalog header. Figure 3-3  illustrates the high level circuit diagram for this use case.Table 3-1: AMS101 Evaluation Card Use Cases\nUse CaseDAC \nOnboard \nSignal \nSourceExternal \nAnalog \nSourceSimul Sampled Uni-polar Bi-polar\nTest — — FFT INL FFT INL FFT INL\n1x xxxxxx\n2 x x x x \n32 www.xilinx.com AMS101 Evaluation Card User Guide\nUG886 (v1.3) November 6, 2013Chapter 3: AMS101 Evaluation Hardware\nTo enable this use case, connect jumpers J3 and J5 between pins 1 and 2 as shown in \nFigure 3-4 . Only these two jumpers need to be populated. DAC A always supplies the \noutput to the positive XADC inputs (VP, VAUX0P , and VAUX8P ).

To operate the AMS101 evaluation card in any \none of those modes, see XADC Configuration, page 38 . If the optimum dynamic \nperformance is required, use an external signal source. Select an appropriate Use Case (2 or \n3) for the desired operating conditions based on Table 3-1 . \nThe AMS Evaluator tool GUI allows you a good amount of control and flexibility over the \ntwo DAC outputs in the AD5065. See Figure 4-5, page 41  for more details. Check the \nGenerate Sinewave Using DAC  box to output a sine wave on DAC A and DC bias voltage \non DAC B. Uncheck the Generate Sinewave Using DAC  box and both DACs output the \nDC voltages as written in the VP offset  and VN offset  boxes. DAC A (VP offset) always \nsupplies the analog voltage to the positive XADC inputs (VP, VAUXP0 , and VAUXP8 ) and \nDAC B ( VN offset) always supplies the analog vo ltage to the negative XADC inputs (VN, \nVAUXN0 , and VAUXN8 ).\nFor simplicity, on the AMS101 evaluation card, all three positive XADC inputs (VP, \nVAUXP0 , and VAUXP8 ) have been shorted together and all three negative XADC inputs (VN, \nVAUXN0 , and VAUXN8 ) have been shorted together. \nUse Case 2—Single-Ended External Analog Source\nUse Case 2 allows an external analog voltage source on the positive input to the XADC (VP, \nVAUXP0 , and VAUXP8 ). The negative analog input (VN, VAUXN0 , and VAUXN8 ) is supplied by \nDAC B. See Figure 3-5 . This allows the common-mode voltage on the negative input to \nrange between 0V and 1V . This DAC voltage is configurable in the AMS Evaluator tool GUI. \nFor Use Case 2, connect jumper J3 between pi ns 2 and 3 and connect the external analog \nsignal to pin 1 of jumper J2 . Connect jumper J5 between pins 1 and 2 to supply the DAC B \nvoltage as set by the \nVN offset  box in the AMS Evaluator tool.

These panels specify the XADC sampling rate, the input \nsignal type (unipolar or bipola r), and either single channel mode or simultaneous channel \nmode. Changing any of the items on the XADC Control panel writes the appropriate data to the XADC register automatically. \nThe XADC sample rate can be set betwee n 100 kilo-samples per second (kSPS) and \n1 MSPS. Unipolar inputs force the negative an alog input to ground and the positive input \ncan swing between 0 and 1V . Bipolar inputs al low both analog inputs to swing +/-500 mV , \nwith a common-mode range between 0 and 1V . Si ngle channel mode measures data on the \nV\nP/VN channels.

The speed of the ADC \nis dictated by the frequency of the clock, whic h is the divided-down version of the clock it \nreceives at the block level. The clock divide r register of the XADC defines the division \nfactor. The GUI gives dire ct access to it (see Figure 4-4 ). A clock divide ratio can be input \ndirectly, or a desired ADC sample rate can be  specified, and the GUI in this instance \ncalculates the most appropriate clock divider. By default, the clock divide register is set so that the XADC sample rate is 1 MSPS. The XADC clock is 100 MHz and a clock divide ratio of four gives a sample rate of 961.54 kSPS.

The AMS Evaluator tool then  does a mean, minimum, maximum, and \nstandard deviation calculation on the data before  displaying it. In the case of simultaneous \nsampling mode, 8,192 XADC re sults are taken, 4,096 for VAUX0  and 4,096 for VAUX8 . The \nAMS Evaluator tool receives all 8,192 pieces of data in one array and splits it appropriately. \nThe tool then does a mean, minimum, maxi mum, and standard deviation calculation \nseparately on VAUX0  and VAUX8  data. The VAUX0  and VAUX8  data is then displayed side by \nside in a dual display. The mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation calculation \nresults are shown below the graph of the XADC samples. \nFrequency Domain\nThe Frequency Domain  tab enables an FFT on the XADC data. Similar to the time domain \ndata collection, 4,096 sequential XADC results for VP/VN are taken when in single channel \nmode and 4,096 XADC results of VAUX0  and 4,096 XADC results of VAUX8  are taken in \nsimultaneous sampling mode. An FFT is then performed on this data and key ADC dynamic performance metrics are calculated an d displayed. These metrics include signal \nto noise ratio (SNR), total harmonic distorti on (THD), signal to noise and distortion \n(SINAD), spurious free dynamic range (SFDR) , and effective number of bits (ENOB).\nIf the signal source is  not the DAC on the evaluation card, then windowing is carried out \non the XADC data before the FFT is performed. This is because the external source might or might not be a coherent source. The windowing method can be changed by adjusting the pull-down menu shown in Figure 4-6 . By default, it is set to a fourth order \nBlackman-Harris window, and five bins on eith er side of the fundamental are discarded in \nthe SNR calculation. \nX-Ref Target - Figure 4-6\nFigure 4-6: Windowing OptionsUG886_c4_06_092512\nWindowing Method \nEmployedNumber of Bins Ignored in \nSNR Calculation\nAMS101 Evaluation Card User Guide www.xilinx.com 43\nUG886 (v1.3) November 6, 2013XADC Performance Tests\nLinearity\nSelect the Linearity  tab to perform a linearity test on th e XADC. During this test, the signal \nsource is used as a map source to the XADC. \nWhen the Collect Data  button is clicked in the GUI, the DAC begins to ramp up and the \nXADC results are collected into a histogram. This histogram data is then transferred to the GUI through the USB-UART connection and a differential non-linearity (DNL) and integral non-linearity (INL) calculation ar e performed. This data then displays.\nSensor Data\nThe XADC block contains four integrated sensors within the FPGA. The first is a \ntemperature sensor and the other three monitor the FPGA voltage supplies: VCCAUX , \nVCCINT , and VCCBRAM . These sensors are all digitized by the XADC when the XADC is in \ndefault mode or when they are enabled as part of the channel sequence of the XADC. \nWhen the Sensor Data  tab is selected, all of the XADC settings are stored in memory in the \nGUI. The part is then forced into Default mode. See 7 Series FPGAs and Zynq-7000 All \nProgrammable SoC XADC Dual 12-Bit 1 MSPS Analog-to-Digital Converter User Guide  \n(UG480) [Ref 6] . The digitized representation for the XADC then displays.\nThe Power Control  panel highlighted in Figure 4-7  can be used to modify physical \nvoltages being applied to the three supplies in question: VCCAUX , VCCINT , and VCCBRAM . \nAfter changing the voltages and clicking the Update UCD9248  button, the corresponding \nplot should change, showing the actual voltag e now being applied to the part within the \npart itself.\nX-Ref Target - Figure 4-7\nFigure 4-7: Sensor Data Tab and Power Control Panel\nUG886_c4_07_11041 3Change the actual voltages being applied to the FPGA \nwith  the Te x as Instrument s UCD924 8 power controller.\n44 www.xilinx.com AMS101 Evaluation Card User Guide\nUG886 (v1.3) November 6, 2013Chapter 4: AMS Evaluator Tool\nAMS Demonstration\nThe Analog Mixed Signal (AMS) technology leverages the digital signal processing \ncapabilities of Xilinx FPGA interconne ct logic to enhance the performance and \nfunctionality of the local XADC block. The AM S101 evaluation card offers a very limited \nglimpse into the possibilities of the AMS concept by enabling efficient decimation.\nDecimation\nThe AMS Evaluator tool enables decimation of the XADC data by a certain factor, \neffectively trading off input bandwidth for high er SNR performance. This factor is defined \nby the field shown on Figure 4-8 . Select between a decimation rate of 1, 2, 4, 8, or 16. A \ndecimation of 1 indicates that the XADC data is passed directly to the AMS Evaluator tool without any filtering or decimation. The decima tion function is carried out in the FPGA \nusing very little resources. The core building block is a decimate by 2 block. It first passes the XADC data through a half-band filter and then decimates by a factor of 2, as shown in Figure 4-9 .\nDecimating by 2 cuts the input bandwidt h in half. The frequency graph in the Frequency \nDomain  tab reflects this as the input bandwidth goes from 500 kHz with a decimation of 1 \nto 250 kHz with a decimation of 2.\nTo achieve a decimate by 4, the FPGA passes the XADC data through the decimate by 2 \nblock and feeds back its output to the block’s input so that it can be band-limited and decimated by 2 again, giving an overall decimation rate of 4. Fo r a decimation rate of 8, the \ndata is looped back through the de cimate by 2 block a second time.X-Ref Target - Figure 4-8\nFigure 4-8: Decimation Rate Selection\nX-Ref T arget - Fig ure 4-8\nUG886_c4_0 8_062512Change\nDecim ation\nbetween\n1, 2, 4, 8, or 16\nAMS101 Evaluation Card User Guide www.xilinx.com 45\nUG886 (v1.3) November 6, 2013AMS Demonstration\nDecimation is a powerful way of im proving the SNR, SINAD, and ENOB.
