It offers low ON-state resistance and excellent ON-state resistance matching with \nthe break-before-make feature, to prevent signal distortion during the transferring of a signal from one channel \nto another. The device has excellent total harmonic distortion (THD) performance, low ON-state resistance, and \nconsumes very low power. These are some of the features that make this device suitable for a variety of markets \nand many different applications.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nIN1COM1NC1\nNO1SPDT\nLogic  \nControl\nIN2COM2NC2\nNO2SPDT\nLogic  \nControl\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe TS3A24159 device is bidirectional with two single-pole, double-throw switches.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe switch of the TS3A24159 device is bidirectional. Hence, NO, NC, and COM pins can be used as both inputs \nor outputs.\n9.2 Typical Application\nTS3A24159VCC\nIN1\nIN2\nCOM1\nCOM4GNDNO1System\nController\nDevice 1\nDevice 20.1 PF 0.1 PF3.3 V \nSignal \nPath Switch \nControl \nLogicNC1\nDevice 3 NO2\nNC2 Device 4COM2\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nEnsure that all of the signals passing through the switch are within the specified ranges to ensure proper \nperformance.\nTable 9-1.

However, it is \nrecommended to connect the unused pins to ground through a 50- Ω resistor to prevent signal reflections back \ninto the device. It is also recommended that the digital control pins (IN1 and IN2) be pulled up to V CC or down to \nGND to avoid undesired switch positions that could result from the floating pin.\nSelect the appropriate supply voltage to cover the entire voltage swing of the signal passing through the switch \nbecause the TS3A24159 input/output signal swing through NO and COM are dependant of the supply voltage \nVCC.\n9.2.3 Application Curve\n0.0000.0500.1000.1500.2000.2500.3000.350\n0.00 0.16 0.32 0.49 0.65 0.81 0.97 1.13 1.30 1.46 1.62 1.78 1.94 2.11 2.27 2.43 2.59– °40 C\n25°C\n85°Cr ( )onΩ\nV (V)COM\nFigure 9-1. rON vs V COM \n10 Power Supply Recommendations\n•Proper power-supply sequencing is recommended for all CMOS devices.\n•Do not exceed the absolute maximum ratings, because stresses beyond the listed ratings can cause \npermanent damage to the device.\n•Always sequence V CC on first, followed by NO or COM.\n•Although it is not required, power-supply bypassing improves noise margin and prevents switching noise \npropagation from the V CC supply to other components.\n•A 0.1-μF capacitor, connected from V CC to GND, is adequate for most applications.TS3A24159\nSCDS238H – MARCH 2007 – REVISED AUGUST 2022 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TS3A24159\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nTo ensure reliability of the device, following common printed-circuit board layout guidelines is recommended. \nBypass capacitors must be used on power supplies.
