General description\nCBTL02043A/B is a 2 differential channel, 2- to-1 multiplexer/demu ltiplexer switch for \nUSB 3.1, PCI Express Generation 3, or other high-speed serial interface applications. The \nCBTL02043A/B can switch two differential si gnals to one of two locations. Using a unique \ndesign technique, NXP has minimized the impedance of the switch such that the \nattenuation observed through the switch is negligible, and also minimized the \nchannel-to-channel skew as well as channel-to-channel crosstalk, as required by the high-speed serial interface. CBTL02043A/B al lows expansion of existing high-speed ports \nfor extremely low power.\nThe device's pinouts are optimized to match different application layouts. CBTL02043A \nhas input and output pins on the opposite of the package, and is suitable for edge \nconnector(s) with different signal sources on the motherboard. CBTL02043B has outputs \non both sides of the package, and the device  can be placed between two connectors to \nmultiplex differential signals from a controller.

Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n15.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n15.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, leaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n15.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhe sive and flux, clinching of leads, board \ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are \nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\nCBTL02043A_CBTL02043B All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

It is imperative that the peak temperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 10\n and 11\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 9 .Table 10.
