The device is capable of supplying 500mA  \nof output current with a typical dropout voltage of only \n85mV . A BIAS supply is required to run the internal ref -\nerence and LDO circuitry while output current comes \ndirectly from the IN supply for high efficiency regulation. \nThe LTC3025 -1 features an adjustable output with a low \n0.4V reference while the LTC3025 -2, LTC3025 -3, and \nLTC3025 -4 have fixed 1.2V, 1.5V and 1.8V output volt -\nages respectively.\nThe LTC3025 -X’s low quiescent current makes it an ideal \nchoice for use in battery-powered systems. For 3-cell \nNiMH and single cell Li-Ion applications, the BIAS voltage \ncan be supplied directly from the battery while the input \ncan come from a high efficiency buck regulator , providing \na high efficiency, low noise output.\nOther features include high output voltage accuracy, \nexcellent transient response, stability with ultralow ESR \nceramic capacitors as small as 1µF, short-circuit and ther -\nmal overload protection and output current limiting. The \nLTC3025 -X is available in a tiny, low profile ( 0.75mm ) \n6-lead DFN ( 2mm  × 2mm ) package.\n1.2V Output Voltage from 1.5V Input Supply nWide Input Voltage Range : 0.9V to 5.5V\n nStable with Ceramic Capacitors\n nVery Low Dropout : 85mV  at 500mA\n nAdjustable Output Range : 0.4V to 3.6V (LTC3025 -1)\n nFixed Output : 1.2V (LTC3025 -2), 1.5V (LTC3025 -3), \n1.8V (LTC3025 -4)\n n±2% Voltage Accuracy over Temperature,  \nSupply and Load\n nLow Noise : 80µV RMS (10Hz  to 100kHz )\n nBIAS Voltage Range : 2.5V to 5.5V\n nFast T ransient Recovery\n nShutdown Disconnects Load from V IN and V BIAS\n nLow Operating Current : IIN = 4µA, IBIAS = 50µA  Typ\n nLow Shutdown Current : IIN = 1µA, IBIAS = 0.01µA  Typ\n nOutput Current Limit\n nThermal Overload Protection\n nAvailable in 6-Lead ( 2mm  × 2mm ) DFN Package\n nAEC- Q100  Qualified for Automotive Applications\n nLow Power Handheld Devices\n nLow Voltage Logic Supplies\n nDSP Power Supplies\n nCellular Phones\n nPortable Electronic Equipment\n nHandheld Medical Instruments\n nPost Regulator for Switching Supply Noise Rejection\n1MHz  VIN Supply Rejection\nL TC3025-2BIAS\n0.1µF\n1.5V1µF\n0.1µFLi-Ion\nOR \n3-CELL\nNiMHIN\nSHDNOUTVOUT = 1.2V\nIOUT ≤ 500mA\n30251234 TA01SENSE\nGND OFF  ON1.5V HIGH\nEFFICIENCY\nDC/DC\nBUCK\nVIN (V)1.20REJECTION (dB)\n515202550\n35\n1.6 2.0 2.2\n30251234 TA01b104045\n30\n1.4 1.8 2.4 2.6BIAS = 3.6V\nVOUT = 1.2VIOUT = 100mA\nIOUT = 300mACOUT = 1µFCOUT = 10µFAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners.

H For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOperation  (Refer to Block Diagram ) \nThe LTC3025 -X is a micropower , VLDO (very low dropout) \nlinear regulator which operates from input voltages as low \nas 0.9V. The device provides a highly accurate output that \nis capable of supplying 500mA  of output current with a \ntypical dropout voltage of only 85mV . A single ceramic \ncapacitor as small as 1µF is all that is required for output \nbypassing. A low reference voltage allows the LTC3025 -1 \noutput to be programmed to much lower voltages than \navailable in common LDOs (range of 0.4V to 3. 6V). The \nLTC3025 -2/LTC3025 -3/LTC3025 -4 have fixed outputs of \n1.2V, 1.5V and 1.8V respectively, eliminating the need for \nan external resistor divider .\nAs shown in the Block Diagram , the BIAS input supplies \nthe internal reference and LDO circuitry while all output \ncurrent comes directly from the IN input for high effi -\nciency regulation. The low quiescent supply currents I IN = \n4µA, IBIAS = 50µA  drop to I IN = 1µA, IBIAS = 0.01µA  typical \nin shutdown making the LTC3025 -X an ideal choice for \nuse in battery-powered systems.\nThe device includes current limit and thermal overload \nprotection. The fast transient response of the follower \noutput stage overcomes the traditional trade off between \ndropout voltage, quiescent current and load transient \nresponse inherent in most LDO regulator architectures. \nThe LTC3025 -X also includes overshoot detection cir -\ncuitry which brings the output back into regulation when \ngoing from heavy to light output loads (see Figure \xa01).\nFigure\xa01. LTC3025 -X T ransient Response300mA\n0mAIOUT\nVOUT\nAC\n20mV/DIV\nVIN = 1.5V\nVOUT = 1.2V\nVBIAS = 3.6V\nCOUT = 1µF100µs/DIV30251234 F01\nAdjustable Output Voltage ( LTC3025 -1)\nThe output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resis -\ntors as shown in Figure\xa02 . The device servos the output \nto maintain the ADJ pin voltage at 0.4V (referenced to \nground). Thus, the current in R1 is equal to 0.4V/R1. For \ngood transient response, stability, and accuracy, the cur -\nrent in R1 should be at least 8µA, thus the value of R1 \nshould be no greater than 50k. The current in R2 is the \ncurrent in R1 plus the ADJ pin bias current. Since the \nADJ pin bias current is typically <10nA , it can be ignored \nin the output voltage calculation. The output voltage can \nbe calculated using the formula in Figure\xa02 . Note that in \nshutdown the output is turned off and the divider current \nwill be zero once C OUT is discharged.\nThe LTC3025 -1 operates at a relatively high gain of \n–0.7µV /mA referred to the ADJ input. Thus a load current \nchange of 1mA to 500mA  produces a –0.35mV  drop at \nthe ADJ input. To calculate the change referred to the out -\nput simply multiply by the gain of the feedback network  \n(i. e. ,1 + R2/R1). For example, to program the output for \n1.2V choose R2/R1 = 2. In this example, an output current \nchange of 1mA to 500mA  produces –0.35mV  • (1 + 2) = \n1.05mV  drop at the output.\nBecause the ADJ pin is relatively high impedance (depend -\ning on the resistor divider used), stray capacitance at this \npin should be minimized ( <10pF ) to prevent phase shift \nin the error amplifier loop. Additionally, special attention \nshould be given to any stray capacitances that can couple \nexternal signals onto the ADJ pin producing undesirable \noutput ripple. For optimum performance connect the ADJ \npin to R1 and R2 with a short PCB trace and minimize all \nother stray capacitance to the ADJ pin.\nFigure\xa02.

H For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe LTC3025 -X is designed to be stable with a wide \nrange of ceramic output capacitors. The ESR of the out -\nput capacitor affects stability, most notably with small \ncapacitors. A minimum output capacitor of 1µF with an \nESR of 0.05Ω  or less is recommended to ensure stability. \nThe LTC3025 -X is a micropower device and output tran -\nsient response will be a function of output capacitance. \nLarger values of output capacitance decrease the peak \ndeviations and provide improved transient response for \nlarger load current changes. Note that bypass capacitors \nused to decouple individual components powered by the \nLTC3025 -X will increase the effective output capacitor \nvalue. High ESR tantalum and electrolytic capacitors may \nbe used, but a low ESR ceramic capacitor must be in par -\nallel at the output. There is no minimum ESR or maximum \ncapacitor size requirements.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across \ntemperature and applied voltage. The most common \ndielectrics used are Z5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and \nY5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances \nin a small package, but exhibit large voltage and tem -\nperature coefficients as shown in Figure\xa03  and Figure\xa04 . \nWhen used with a 2V regulator , a 1µF Y5V capacitor can \nlose as much as 75% of its initial capacitance over the \noperating temperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics \nresult in more stable characteristics and are usually more \nsuitable for use as the output capacitor . The X7R type has \nbetter stability across temperature, while the X5R is less \nexpensive and is available in higher values. In all cases, Figure\xa03.

H For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nthe output capacitance should never drop below 0.4µF , or \ninstability or degraded performance may occur .\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature ( 125°C). The \npower dissipated by the device will be the output current \nmultiplied by the input/output voltage differential :\n (I OUT) (VIN – VOUT)\nNote that the BIAS current is less than 500µA  even under \nheavy loads, so its power consumption can be ignored \nfor thermal calculations.\nThe LTC3025 -X has internal thermal limiting designed to \nprotect the device during momentary overload conditions. \nFor continuous normal conditions, the maximum junction \ntemperature rating of 125°C must not be exceeded. It is \nimportant to give careful consideration to all sources of \nthermal resistance from junction to ambient. Additional \nheat sources mounted nearby must also be considered. \nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat-spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated \nthrough holes can also be used to spread the heat gener -\nated by power devices.\nThe LTC3025 -X 2mm  × 2mm  DFN package is specified \nas having a junction-to-ambient thermal resistance of \n102°C/W , which assumes a minimal heat spreading cop -\nper plane. The actual thermal resistance can be reduced \nsubstantially by connecting the package directly to a good \nheat spreading ground plane. When soldered to 2500m m2 \ndouble-sided 1 oz. copper plane, the actual junction-to-\nambient thermal resistance can be less than 60°C/W . \nCalculating Junction Temperature\nExample : Given an output voltage of 1.2V, an input voltage \nof 1.8V to 3V, an output current range of 0mA to 100mA  and a maximum ambient temperature of 50°C, what will \nthe maximum junction temperature be ?\nThe power dissipated by the device will be equal to :\n IOUT(MAX) (VIN(MAX) – VOUT) \nwhere :\n IOUT(MAX) = 100mA\n V IN(MAX) = 3V\nSo:\n P = 100mA (3V – 1.2V) = 0.18W\nEven under worst-case conditions, the LTC3025 -X’s BIAS \npin power dissipation is only about 1mW , thus can be \nignored. Assuming a junction-to-ambient thermal resis -\ntance of 102°C/W , the junction temperature rise above \nambient will be approximately equal to :\n 0.18W (102°C/W) = 18.4°C\nThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to \nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient \nplus the maximum ambient temperature or :\n T J = 50°C + 18. 4°C = 68.4°C\nShort-Circuit/Thermal Protection\nThe LTC3025 -X has built-in short-circuit current limit -\ning as well as overtemperature protection. During short-\ncircuit conditions, internal circuitry automatically limits \nthe output current to approximately 1130mA . At higher \ntemperatures, or in cases where internal power dissipa -\ntion causes excessive self heating on chip, the thermal \nshutdown circuitry will shut down the LDO when the \njunction temperature exceeds approximately 150°C. It \nwill re enable the LDO once the junction temperature \ndrops back to approximately 140°C. The LTC3025 -X will \ncycle in and out of thermal shutdown without latch-up or \ndamage until the overstress condition is removed. Long \nLTC3025-1/LTC3025-2/\nLTC3025-3/LTC3025-4\n11\nRev.

When the LDO \nis enabled, the soft-start circuitry gradually increases \nthe LDO reference voltage from 0V to 0.4V over a period \nof about 600µs . There is a short 700µs  delay from the time the part is enabled until the LDO output starts to \nrise. Figure\xa05  shows the start-up and shutdown output \nwaveform. \nVOUT Start-Up and Supply Sequencing\nDuring power-up, the output shutdown circuitry is not \nactive below V IN of about 0.65V  DC (typical). As a result, \nthe output voltage can drift up during power-up due to \nleakage current ( <1 mA typical) from V IN to V OUT . At 0.9V \ninput, the shutdown circuitry is active and the output is \nactively held off. This usually causes no circuit prob -\nlems and is similar to 3-terminal regulators such as the \nLT3080 , LT1086  and LT317  which have no ground pin \nand can have the output rise under some conditions. A \nslowly rising V IN with the part enabled may result in non-\nmonotonic ramping of V OUT due to LDO circuitry becom -\ning active at V IN of about 0.65V  (typical) as well.\nWith fast rising inputs ( >1V/ms) or with sufficient resis -\ntive load on V OUT , output voltage rise during power-up \nis reduced or eliminated. Such conditions also reduce or \neliminate non-monotonic initial power-up with the part \nenabled. If V BIAS is sequenced up before V IN, the leakage \ncurrent from V IN to V OUT may increase until the shutdown \ncircuitry is active at a V IN of about 0.65V  typical. Thus, \nto minimize V OUT rise during start-up, sequence up V IN \nbefore V BIAS. At V IN = 0.9V, the output is actively held off \nin shutdown or it is actively held on when enabled under \nall conditions.\nLTC3025-1/LTC3025-2/\nLTC3025-3/LTC3025-4\n12\nRev.
