The ACS713 outputs an analog signal, VOUT . \nthat varies linearly with the unidirectional DC primary sensed current, I\nP , within the range specified. CF is recommended for \nnoise management, with values that depend on the application.ACS713\nDescription\nThe Allegro® ACS713 provides economical and precise \nsolutions for DC current sensing in industrial, commercial, and communications systems. The device package allows for easy implementation by the customer. Typical applications include motor control, load detection and management, switched-mode power supplies, and overcurrent fault protection.\nThe device consists of a precise, low-offset, linear Hall \nsensor circuit with a copper conduction path located near the surface of the die. Applied current flowing through this copper conduction path generates a magnetic field which is sensed by the integrated Hall IC and converted into a proportional voltage. Device accuracy is optimized through the close proximity of the magnetic signal to the Hall transducer. A precise, proportional voltage is provided by the low-offset, chopper-stabilized BiCMOS Hall IC, which is programmed for accuracy after packaging.\nThe output of the device has a positive slope (>V\nIOUT(Q) ) \nwhen an increasing current flows through the primary copper conduction path (from pins 1 and 2, to pins 3 and 4), which is the path used for current sensing. The internal resistance of this conductive path is 1.2 m Ω typical, providing low power \nloss. The thickness of the copper conductor allows survival \nACS713-DS, Rev. 5Fully Integrated, Hall Effect-Based Linear Current Sensor \nwith 2.1 kVRMS Isolation and a Low-Resistance Current Conductor\nContinued on the next page…Package: 8 Lead SOIC (suffix LC)\nIP+\nIP+\nIP–\nIP– 5GND2\n41\n3ACS71378\nVIOUT\n6FILTERVCC\nIP+5 V\nVOUT\nCFCBYP\n0.1 μF\nFeatures and Benefits\n▪ Low-noise analog signal path\n▪ Device bandwidth is set via the new FILTER pin\n▪ 5 μs output rise time in response to step input current\n▪ 80 kHz bandwidth\n▪ Total output error 1.5% at TA = 25°C\n▪ Small footprint, low-profile SOIC8 package\n▪ 1.2 mΩ internal conductor resistance\n▪ 2.1 kVRMS minimum isolation voltage from pins 1-4 to pins 5-8\n▪ 5.0 V , single supply operation\n▪ 133 to 185 mV/A output sensitivity\n▪ Output voltage proportional to DC currents\n▪ Factory-trimmed for accuracy\n▪ Extremely stable output offset voltage\n▪ Nearly zero magnetic hysteresis\n▪ Ratiometric output from supply voltage\nTypical ApplicationTÜV America\nCertificate Number:U8V 06 05 54214 010\n\nFully Integrated, Hall Effect-Based Linear Current Sensor \nwith 2.1 kVRMS Isolation and a Low-Resistance Current ConductorACS713\n2 Allegro MicroSystems, Inc.\n115 Northeast Cutoff, Box 15036\nWorcester, Massachusetts 01615-0036  (508) 853-5000\nwww.allegromicro.comAbsolute Maximum Ratings\nCharacteristic Symbol Notes Rating Units\nSupply Voltage VCC 8V\nReverse Supply Voltage VRCC –0.1 V\nOutput Voltage VIOUT 8V\nReverse Output Voltage VRIOUT –0.1 V\nReinforced Isolation Voltage VISOPins 1-4 and 5-8; 60 Hz, 1 minute, TA=25°C 2100 V\nVoltage applied to leadframe (Ip+ pins), based \non IEC 60950184 Vpeak\nBasic Isolation Voltage VISO(bsc)Pins 1-4 and 5-8; 60 Hz, 1 minute, TA=25°C 1500 V\nVoltage applied to leadframe (Ip+ pins), based \non IEC 60950354 Vpeak\nOutput Current Source IOUT(Source)  3m A\nOutput Current Sink IOUT(Sink) 10 mA\nOvercurrent Transient Tolerance IP 1 pulse, 100 ms 100 A\nNominal Operating Ambient Temperature TA Range E –40 to 85 ºC\nMaximum Junction Temperature TJ(max) 165 ºC\nStorage Temperature Tstg –65 to 170 ºCSelection Guide\nPart Number Packing*TA \n(°C)Optimized Range, IP\n(A)Sensitivity, Sens \n(Typ) (mV/A)\nACS713ELCTR-20A-T Tape and reel, 3000 pieces/reel –40 to 85 0 to 20 185\nACS713ELCTR-30A-T Tape and reel, 3000 pieces/reel –40 to 85 0 to 30 133*Contact Allegro for additional packing options.of the device at up to 5× overcurrent conditions.

The change in sensor output in response to a \n1 A change through the primary conductor. The sensitivity is the product of the magnetic circuit sensitivity (G / A) and the linear IC amplifier gain (mV/G). The linear IC amplifier gain is pro-grammed at the factory to optimize the sensitivity (mV/A) for the full-scale current of the device.\nNoise (V\nNOISE ). The product of the linear IC amplifier gain \n(mV/G) and the noise floor for the Allegro Hall effect linear IC (≈1 G).  The noise floor is derived from the thermal and shot \nnoise observed in Hall elements. Dividing the noise (mV) by the sensitivity (mV/A) provides the smallest current that the device is able to resolve.   \nLinearity (E\nLIN). The degree to which the voltage output from \nthe sensor varies in direct proportion to the primary current through its full-scale amplitude. Nonlinearity in the output can be attributed to the saturation of the flux concentrator approaching the full-scale current. The following equation is used to derive the linearity: \nwhere V\nIOUT_full-scale amperes  = the output voltage (V) when the \nsensed current approximates full-scale ±IP .\nQuiescent output voltage (VIOUT(Q) ). The output of the sensor \nwhen the primary current is zero.  For a unipolar supply voltage, it\n nominally remains at VCC / 2.  Thus, VCC = 5 V translates into \nVIOUT(Q)  = 2.5 V . Variation in VIOUT(Q) can be attributed to the \nresolution of the Allegro linear IC quiescent voltage trim and thermal drift.\nElectrical offset voltage (V\nOE). The deviation of the device out-\nput from its ideal quiescent value of VCC / 2 due to nonmagnetic \ncauses. To convert this voltage to amperes, divide by the device sensitivity, Sens. \nAccuracy (E\nTOT). The accuracy represents the maximum devia-\ntion of the actual output from its ideal value.  This is also known as the total ouput error.  The accuracy is illustrated graphically in the output voltage versus current chart at right.Accuracy is divided into four areas:\n\uf0b7\uf0200 A at 25°C.

Allegro patented a Chopper Stabiliza-\ntion technique that nearly eliminates Hall IC output drift induced \nby temperature or package stress effects. This offset reduction \ntechnique is based on a signal modulation-demodulation process. \nModulation is used to separate the undesired dc offset signal from the magnetically induced signal in the frequency domain.  Then, \nusing a low-pass filter, the modulated dc offset is suppressed \nwhile the magnetically induced signal passes through the filter.  As a result of this chopper stabilization approach, the output \nvoltage from the Hall IC is desensitized to the effects of tempera-ture and mechanical stress. This technique produces devices that have an extremely stable Electrical Offset V oltage, are immune to thermal stress, and have precise recoverability after temperature \ncycling.  \nThis technique is made possible through the use of a BiCMOS \nprocess that allows the use of low-offset and low-noise amplifiers \nin combination with high-density logic integration and sample and hold circuits.

Such a low-pass filter improves the signal-to-noise ratio, and therefore the resolution, of the sensor output signal. However, the addition of an RC filter to the output of a sensor IC can result in undesirable sensor output attenuation — even for dc signals. \nSignal attenuation, ∆V\nATT , is a result of the resistive divider \neffect between the resistance of the external filter, RF (see Appli-\ncation 5), and the input impedance and resistance of the customer interface circuit, R\nINTFC . The transfer function of this resistive \ndivider is given by:\nEven if RF and RINTFC  are designed to match, the two individual \nresistance values will most likely drift by different amounts over temperature. Therefore, signal attenuation will vary as a function \nof temperature. Note that, in many cases, the input impedance, R\nINTFC  , of a typical analog-to-digital converter (ADC) can be as \nlow as 10 k Ω.\nThe ACS713 contains an internal resistor, a FILTER pin connec-\ntion to the printed circuit board, and an internal buffer ampli-fier. With this circuit architecture, users can implement a simple RC filter via the addition of a capacitor, C\nF (see Application 6) \nfrom the FILTER pin to ground. The buffer amplifier inside of the ACS713 (located after the internal resistor and FILTER pin connection) eliminates the attenuation caused by the resistive divider effect described in the equation for ∆V\nATT.
