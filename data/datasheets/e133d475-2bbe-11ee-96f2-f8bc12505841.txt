The AD9280 uses a multistage\ndifferential pipeline architecture at 32 MSPS data rates andguarantees no missing codes over the full operating temperature\nrange.\nThe input of the AD9280 has been designed to ease the devel-\nopment of both imaging and communications systems. The usercan select a variety of input ranges and offsets and can drive the\ninput either single-ended or differentially.\nThe sample-and-hold amplifier (SHA) is equally suited for both\nmultiplexed systems that switch full-scale voltage levels in suc-cessive channels and sampling single-channel inputs at frequen-\ncies up to and beyond the Nyquist rate. AC-coupled input\nsignals can be shifted to a predetermined level, with an onboardclamp circuit. The dynamic performance is excellent.\nThe AD9280 has an onboard programmable reference. An\nexternal reference can also be chosen to suit the dc accuracy and\ntemperature drift requirements of the application.A single clock input is used to control all internal conversioncycles. The digital output data is presented in straight binaryoutput format. An out-of-range signal (OTR) indicates an over-\nflow condition which can be used with the most significant bit\nto determine low or high overflow.\nThe AD9280 can operate with a supply range from +2.7 V to\n+5.5 V, ideally suiting it for low power operation in high speed\napplications.\nThe AD9280 is specified over the industrial (–40 °C to +85 °C)\ntemperature range.\nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS\nLow Power\nThe AD9280 consumes 95 mW on a 3 V supply (excluding the\nreference power). In sleep mode, power is reduced to below\n5 mW.\nVery Small Package\nThe AD9280 is available in a 28-lead SSOP package.\nPin Compatible with AD876-8\nThe AD9280 is pin compatible with the AD876-8, allowingolder designs to migrate to lower supply voltages.\n300 MHz Onboard Sample-and-Hold\nThe versatile SHA input can be configured for either single-\nended or differential inputs.\nOut-of-Range Indicator\nThe OTR output bit indicates when the input signal is beyond\nthe AD9280’s input range.\nBuilt-In Clamp Function\nAllows dc restoration of video signals.\nREV.

E\nAD9280\n–6–DEFINITIONS OF SPECIFICATIONS\nIntegral Nonlinearity (INL)\nIntegral nonlinearity refers to the deviation of each individual\ncode from a line drawn from “zero” through “full scale.” The\npoint used as “zero” occurs 1/2 LSB before the first code transi-tion. “Full scale” is defined as a level 1 1/2 LSB beyond the last\ncode transition. The deviation is measured from the center of\neach particular code to the true straight line.\nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL, No Missing Codes)\nAn ideal ADC exhibits code transitions that are exactly 1 LSB\napart. DNL is the deviation from this ideal value. It is often\nspecified in terms of the resolution for which no missing codes(NMC) are guaranteed.\nTypical Characterization Curves\nCODE OFFSET1.0\n0.5\n–1.0\n0 24032DNL\n64 96 128 160 192 2240\n–0.5\nFigure 3.

Typical INLOffset Error\nThe first transition should occur at a level 1 LSB above “zero.”\nOffset is defined as the deviation of the actual first code transi-\ntion from that point.\nGain Error\nThe first code transition should occur for an analog value 1 LSB\nabove nominal negative full scale. The last transition should\noccur for an analog value 1 LSB below the nominal positive full\nscale. Gain error is the deviation of the actual difference be-tween first and last code transitions and the ideal difference\nbetween the first and last code transitions.\nPipeline Delay (Latency)\nThe number of clock cycles between conversion initiation and\nthe associated output data being made available.

Input Bias Current vs. Input VoltageAPPLYING THE AD9280\nTHEORY OF OPERATION\nThe AD9280 implements a pipelined multistage architecture to\nachieve high sample rate with low power. The AD9280 distrib-\nutes the conversion over several smaller A/D subblocks, refining\nthe conversion with progressively higher accuracy as it passesthe results from stage to stage. As a consequence of the distrib-\nuted conversion, the AD9280 requires a small fraction of the\n256 comparators used in a traditional flash type A/D. A sample-\nand-hold function within each of the stages permits the first\nstage to operate on a new input sample while the second, third\nand fourth stages operate on the three preceding samples.\nOPERATIONAL MODES\nThe AD9280 is designed to allow optimal performance in awide variety of imaging, communications and instrumentation\napplications, including pin compatibility with the AD876-8 A/D.\nTo realize this flexibility, internal switches on the AD9280 are\nused to reconfigure the circuit into different modes. These modes\nare selected by appropriate pin strapping. There are three parts\nof the circuit affected by this modality: the voltage reference, thereference buffer, and the analog input. The nature of the appli-\ncation will determine which mode is appropriate: the descrip-\ntions in the following sections, as well as Table I should assist inselecting the desired mode.\nREV. E\nAD9280\n–9–SUMMARY OF MODES\nVOLTAGE REFERENCE\n1 V Mode  the internal reference may be set to 1 V by connect-\ning REFSENSE and VREF together.\n2 V Mode the internal reference my be set to 2 V by connecting\nREFSENSE to analog groundExternal Divider Mode  the internal reference may be set to a\npoint between 1 V and 2 V by adding external resistors. See\nFigure 16f.\nExternal Reference Mode  enables the user to apply an exter-\nnal reference to REFTS, REFBS and VREF pins. This mode\nis attained by tying REFSENSE to VDD.\nREFERENCE BUFFER\nCenter Span Mode  midscale is set by shorting REFTS and\nREFBS together and applying the midscale voltage to that point\nThe MODE pin is set to AVDD/2. The analog input will swing\nabout that midscale point.\nTop/Bottom Mode  sets the input range between two points.\nThe two points are between 1 V and 2 V apart. The Top/Bottom\nMode is enabled by tying the MODE pin to AVDD.\nANALOG INPUT\nDifferential Mode  is attained by driving the AIN pin as one\ndifferential input, shorting REFTS and REFBS together and\ndriving them as the second differential input. The MODE pin\nis tied to AVDD/2. Preferred mode for optimal distortion\nperformance.\nSingle-Ended  is attained by driving the AIN pin while the\nREFTS and REFBS pins are held at dc points. The MODE pin is\ntied to AVDD.Single-Ended/Clamped (AC Coupled)  the input may be\nclamped to some dc level by ac coupling the input. This is done\nby tying the CLAMPIN to some dc point and applying a pulse\nto the CLAMP pin. MODE pin is tied to AVDD.\nSPECIAL\nAD876-8 Mode  enables users of the AD876-8 to drop the\nAD9280 into their socket. This mode is attained by floating or\ngrounding the MODE pin.\nINPUT AND REFERENCE OVERVIEW\nFigure 16, a simplified model of the AD9280, highlights the\nrelationship between the analog input, AIN, and the reference\nvoltages, REFTS, REFBS and VREF. Like the voltages appliedto the resistor ladder in a flash A/D converter, REFTS and\nREFBS define the maximum and minimum input voltages to\nthe A/D.\nThe input stage is normally configured for single-ended opera-\ntion, but allows for differential operation by shorting REFTS\nand REFBS together to be used as the second input.AIN\nREFTS\nREFBSA/D\nCORE\nAD9280SHA\nFigure 15. AD9280 Equivalent Functional Input Circuit\nIn single-ended operation, the input spans the range,\nREFBS ≤ AIN ≤ REFTS\nwhere REFBS  can be connected to GND and REFTS con-\nnected to VREF. If the user requires a different reference range,\nREFBS and REFTS can be driven to any voltage within the\npower supply rails, so long as the difference between the two is\nbetween 1 V and 2 V.\nIn differential operation, REFTS and REFBS are shorted to-\ngether, and the input span is set by VREF,\n(REFTS  – VREF/2 ) ≤ AIN ≤ (REFTS  + VREF/2 )\nwhere VREF  is determined by the internal reference or brought\nin externally by the user.\nThe best noise performance may be obtained by operating the\nAD9280 with a 2 V input range. The best distortion perfor-mance may be obtained by operating the AD9280 with a 1 V\ninput range.\nREFERENCE OPERATION\nThe AD9280 can be configured in a variety of reference topolo-\ngies. The simplest configuration is to use the AD9280’s onboardbandgap reference, which provides a pin-strappable option to\ngenerate either a 1 V or 2 V output. If the user desires a refer-\nence voltage other than those two, an external resistor dividercan be connected between VREF, REFSENSE and analog\nground to generate a potential anywhere between 1 V and 2 V.\nAnother al ternative is to use an external reference for designs\nrequiring enhanced accuracy and/or drift performance. A\nthird alternative is to bring in top and bottom references,\nbypassing VREF altogether.\nFigures 16d, 16e and 16f illustrate the reference and input ar-\nchitecture of the AD9280. In tailoring a desired arrangement,\nthe user can select an input configuration to match drive circuit.\nThen, m oving to the reference modes at the bottom of the\nfigure, select a reference circuit to accommodate the offset and\namplitude of a full-scale signal.\nTable I outlines pin configurations to match user requirements.\nREV.

Kelvin Connected Reference Using the AD9280\nSTANDBY OPERATION\nThe ADC may be placed into a powered down (sleep) mode by\ndriving the STBY (standby) pin to logic high potential and\nholding the clock at logic low. In this mode the typical powerdrain is approximately 4 mW.\nThe ADC will “wake up” in 400 ns (typ) after the standby pulse\ngoes low.\nCLAMP OPERATION\nThe AD9280ARS features an optional clamp circuit for dc\nrestoration of video or ac coupled signals.  Figure 24 shows theinternal clamp circuitry and the external control signals needed\nfor clamp operation.  To enable the clamp, apply a logic high to\nthe CLAMP pin.  This will close the switch SW1.  The clampamplifier will then servo the voltage at the AIN pin to be equal\nto the clamp voltage applied at the CLAMPIN pin.  After the\ndesired clamp level is attained, SW1 is opened by takingCLAMP back to a logic low. Ignoring the droop caused by the\ninput bias current, the input capacitor CIN will hold the dc\nvoltage at AIN constant until the next clamp interval. The inputresistor RIN has a minimum recommended value of 10 Ω, to\nmaintain the closed-loop stability of the clamp amplifier.\nREV. E\nAD9280\n–13–The allowable voltage range that can be applied to CLAMPIN\ndepends on the operational limits of the internal clamp ampli-fier. The recommended clamp range is between 0.5 volts and\n2.0 volts.\nThe input capacitor should be sized to allow sufficient acquisi-\ntion time of the clamp voltage at AIN within the CLAMP inter-val, but also be sized to minimize droop between clamping\nintervals. Specifically, the acquisition time when the switch is\nclosed will equal:\n  TACQ=RINCINlnVC\nVE\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\nwhere VC is the voltage change required across C IN, and V E is\nthe error voltage. VC is calculated by taking the difference be-\ntween the initial input dc level at the start of the clamp interval\nand the clamp voltage supplied at CLAMPIN. V E is a system\ndependent parameter, and equals the maximum tolerable devia-tion from V\nC. For example, if a 2-volt input level needs to be\nclamped to 1 volt at the AD9280’s input within 10 millivolts,\nthen V C equals 2 – 1 or 1 volt, and V E equals 10 mV.  Note that\nonce the proper clamp level is attained at the input, only a very\nsmall voltage change will be required to correct for droop.\nThe voltage droop is calculated with the following equation:\n  dV=IBIAS\nCINt()\nwhere t = time between clamping intervals.\nThe bias current of the AD9280 will depend on the sampling\nrate, F S, and the difference between the reference midpoint,\n(REFTS–REFBS)/2 and the input voltage. For a fixed sampling\nrate of 32 MHz, Figure 14 shows the input bias current for a\ngiven input. For a 1 V input range, the maximum input biascurrent from Figure 14 is 22 µA. For lower sampling rates the\ninput bias current will scale proportionally.\nIf droop is a critical parameter, then the minimum value of C\nIN\nshould be calculated first based on the droop requirement.\nAcquisition time—the width of the CLAMP pulse—can be\nadjusted accordingly once the minimum capacitor value is cho-\nsen.  A tradeoff will often need to be made between droop andacquisition time, or error voltage V\nE.\nClamp Circuit Example\nA single supply video amplifier outputs a level-shifted videosignal between 2 and 3 volts with the following parameters:\nhorizontal period = 63.56 µs,\nhorizontal sync interval = 10.9 µs,\nhorizontal sync pulse = 4.7 µs,\nsync amplitude = 0.3 volts,\nvideo amplitude of 0.7 volts,\nreference black level = 2.3 volts\nThe video signal must be dc restored from a 2- to 3-volt range\ndown to a 1- to 2-volt range. C onfiguring the AD9280 for a\none volt input span with an input range from 1 to 2 v olts (see\nFigure 24), the CLAMPIN voltage can be set to 1 volt with anexternal voltage or by direct connection to REFBS. The CLAMPpulse may be applied during the SYNC pulse, or during theback porch to truncate the SYNC below the AD9280’s mini-mum input voltage. With a C\nIN = 1µF, and R IN = 20Ω, the\nacqui sition time needed to set the input dc level to one volt\nwith 1 mV accuracy is about 140 µs, assuming a full 1 volt V C.\nWith a 1 µF input coupling capacitor, the droop across one\nhorizontal can be calculated:\nIBIAS = 22 µA, and t = 63.5 µs, so dV = 1.397 mV, which is less\nthan one LSB.After the input capacitor is initially charged, the clamp pulse\nwidth only needs to be wide enough to correct small voltage\nerrors such as the droop. The fine scale settling characteristicsof the clamp circuitry are shown in Table II.\nDepend ing on the required accuracy, a CLAMP pulse width of\n1µs–3 µ s should work in most applications. The OFFSET val-\nues ignore the contribution of offset from the clamp amplifier;\nthey simply compare the output code with a “final value” mea-\nsured with a much longer CLAMP pulse duration.\nTable II.\nCLAMP OFFSET\n8 µs <1 LSB\n4 µs <2 LSBs\n3 µs 2 LSBs\n2 µs 5 LSBs\n1 µs 9 LSBs\nCLAMP INAD9280\nCLAMP\nAINCINRIN\nTO\nSHASW1\nFigure 24a.

E\nAD9280\n–14–DRIVING THE ANALOG INPUT\nFigure 25 shows the equivalent analog input of the AD9280, a\nsample-and-hold amplifier (switched capacitor input SHA).\nBringing CLK to a logic low level closes Switches 1 and 2 and\nopens Switch 3. The input source connected to AIN mustcharge capacitor CH during this time. When CLK transitions\nfrom logic “low” to logic “high,” Switches 1 and 2 open, placing\nthe SHA in hold mode. Switch 3 then closes, forcing the outputof the op amp to equal the voltage stored on CH. When CLK\ntransitions from logic “high” to logic “low,” Switch 3 opens\nfirst. Switches 1 and 2 close, placing the SHA in track mode.\nThe structure of the input SHA places certain requirements on\nthe input drive source. The combination of the pin capacitance,\nCP, and the hold capacitance, CH, is typically less than 5 pF.\nThe input source must be able to charge or discharge this ca-pacitance to 8-bit accuracy in one half of a clock cycle. When\nthe SHA goes into track mode, the input source must charge or\ndischarge capacitor CH from the voltage already stored on CHto the new voltage. In the worst case, a full-scale voltage step on\nthe input, the input source must provide the charging current\nthrough the R\nON (50 Ω) of Switch 1 and quickly (within 1/2 CLK\nperiod) settle. This situation corresponds to driving a low input\nimpedance. On the other hand, when the source voltage equals\nthe value previously stored on CH, the hold capacitor requiresno input current and the equivalent input impedance is ex-\ntremely high.\nAdding series resistance between the output of the source and\nthe AIN pin reduces the drive requirements placed on thesource. Figure 26 shows this configuration. The bandwidth of\nthe particular application limits the size of this resistor. To\nmaintain the performance outlined in the data sheet specifica-tions, the resistor should be limited to 20 Ω or less. For applica-\ntions with signal bandwidths less than 16 MHz, the user mayproportionally increase the size of the series resistor. Alterna-tively, adding a shunt capacitance between the AIN pin and\nanalog ground can lower the ac load impedance. The value of\nthis capacitance will depend on the source resistance and therequired signal bandwidth.\nThe input span of the AD9280 is a function of the reference\nvoltages.

AD9280 Equivalent Input Structure\nAIN\nVS< 20V\nAD9280\nFigure 26. Simple AD9280 Drive ConfigurationIn many cases, particularly in single-supply operation, ac cou-\npling offers a convenient way of biasing the analog input signalat the proper signal range. Figure 27 shows a typical configura-\ntion for ac-coupling the analog input signal to the AD9280.\nMaintaining the specifications outlined in the data sheetrequires careful selection of the component values. The most\nimportant is the f\n–3 dB high-pass corner frequency. It is a function of\nR2 and the parallel combination of C1 and C2. The f –3 dB point\ncan be approximated by the equation:\nf–3 dB = 1/(2 · pi · [R2] CEQ)\nwhere CEQ is the parallel combination of C1 and C2. Note that\nC1 is typically a large electrolytic or tantalum capacitor that\nbecomes inductive at high frequencies. Adding a small ceramicor polystyrene capacitor (on the order of 0.01 µF) that does not\nbecome inductive until negligibly higher frequencies, maintainsa low impedance over a wide frequency range.\nNOTE: AC coupled input signals may also be shifted to a desired\nlevel with the AD9280’s internal clamp. See Clamp Operation.\nAINR1\nAD9280IBR2\nVBIASC1\nC2VIN\nFigure 27. AC Coupled Input\nThere are additional considerations when choosing the resistorvalues. The ac-coupling capacitors integrate the switching tran-\nsients present at the input of the AD9280 and cause a net dc\nbias current, I\nB, to flow into the input. The magnitude of the\nbias current in creases as the signal magnitude deviates from\nV midscale and the clock frequency increases; i.e., minimumbias current flow when AIN = V midscale. This bias currentwill re sult in an offset error of (R1 + R2) · I\nB. If it is necessary\nto compensate this error, consider making R2 negligibly small ormodifying VBIAS to account for the resultant offset.\nIn systems that must use dc coupling, use an op amp to level-\nshift a ground-referenced signal to comply with the input re-\nquirements of the AD9280.

E\nAD9280\n–16–APPLICATIONS\nDIRECT IF DOWN CONVERSION USING THE AD9280\nSampling IF signals above an ADC’s baseband region (i.e., dc\nto F S/2) is becoming increasingly popular in communication\napplications. This process is often referred to as Direct IF Down\nConversion or Undersampling. There are several potential ben-\nefits in using the ADC to alias (i.e., or mix) down a narrowbandor wideband IF signal. First and foremost is the elimination of a\ncomplete mixer stage with its associated amplifiers and filters,\nreducing cost and power dissipation. Second is the ability toapply various DSP techniques to perform such functions as\nfiltering, channel selection, quadrature demodulation, data\nreduction, detection, etc. A detailed discussion on using thistechnique in digital receivers can be found in Analog Devices\nApplication Notes AN-301 and AN-302.\nIn Direct IF Down Conversion applications, one exploits the\ninherent sampling process of an ADC in which an IF signallying outside the baseband region can be aliased back into the\nbaseband region in a similar manner that a mixer will down-\nconvert an IF signal. Similar to the mixer topology, an imagerejection filter is required to limit other potential interfering\nsignals from also aliasing back into the ADC’s baseband region.\nA tradeoff exists between the complexity of this image rejectionfilter and the sample rate as well as dynamic range of the ADC.\nThe AD9280 is well suited for various narrowband IF sampling\napplications. The AD9280’s low distortion input SHA has a\nfull-power bandwidth extending to 300 MHz thus encompassingmany popular IF frequencies. The AD9280 will typically yield\nan improvement in SNR when configured for the 2 V span, the\n1 V span provides the optimum full-scale distortion perfor-mance. Furthermore, the 1 V span reduces the performance\nrequirements of the input d river circuitry and thus may be\nmore practical for system implementation purposes.\nFigure 34 shows a simplified schematic of the AD9280 config-\nured in an IF sampling application. To reduce the complexity of\nthe digital demodulator in many quadrature demodulation ap-\nplications, the IF frequency and/or sample rate are selected such\n0.1mFAIN\nREFTSAD9280\nREFBS\nREFSENSEVREF\nAVDD200V\n1kV\n1kV50V\n93.1 V280V50V\n22.1 V200VSAW\nFILTER\nOUTPUT\n50VBANDPASS\nFILTERG1 = 20dB G 2 = 12dB L-C\nMINI CIRCUITS\nT4 - 6T\n1:4\n0.1mF 1.0mF\nFigure 34. Simplified AD9280 IF Sampling Circuitthat the bandlimited IF signal aliases back into the center of the\nADC’s baseband region (i.e., F S/4).  For example, if an IF sig-\nnal centered at 45 MHz is sampled at 20 MSPS, an image of\nthis IF signal will be aliased back to 5.0 MHz which corre-\nsponds to one quarter of the sample rate (i.e., F S/4). This\ndemodulation technique typically reduces the complexity of the\npost digital demodulator ASIC which follows the ADC.\nTo maximize its distortion performance, the AD9280 is config-\nured in the differential mode with a 1 V span using a transformer.The center tap of the transformer is biased at midsupply via a\nresistor divider. Preceding the AD9280 is a bandpass filter as\nwell as a 32 dB gain stage.  A large gain stage may be requiredto compensate for the high insertion losses of a SAW filter used\nfor image rejection.  The gain stage will also provide adequate\nisolation for the SAW filter from the charge “kick back” currentsassociated with AD9280’s input stage.\nThe gain stage can be realized using one or two cascaded\nAD8009 op amps amplifiers. The AD8009 is a low cost, 1 GHz,\ncurrent-feedback op amp having a 3rd order intercept character-ized up to 250 MHz. A passive bandpass filter following the\nAD8009 attenuates its dominant 2nd order distortion products\nwhich would otherwise be aliased back into the AD9280’s\nbaseband region. Also, it reduces any out-of-band noise which\nwould also be aliased back due to the AD9280’s noise band-\nwidth of 220+ MHz. Note, the bandpass filters specifications\nare application dependent and will affect both the total distor-tion and noise performance of this circuit.\nThe distortion and noise performance of an ADC at the given\nIF frequency is of particular concern when evaluating an ADCfor a narrowband IF sampling application. Both single-tone and\ndual-tone SFDR vs. amplitude are very useful in assessing an\nADC’s noise performance and noise contribution due to aper-ture jitter. In any application, one is advised to test several units\nof the same device under the same conditions to evaluate the\ngiven applications sensitivity to that particular device.\nREV.

E\nAD9280\n–23–GROUNDING AND LAYOUT RULES\nAs is the case for any high performance device, proper ground-\ning and layout techniques are essential in achieving optimal\nperformance. The analog and digital grounds on the AD9280have been separated to optimize the management of return\ncurrents in a system. Grounds should be connected near the\nADC. It is recommended that a printed circuit board (PCB) ofat least four la yers, employing a ground plane and power planes,\nbe used with the AD9280. The use of ground and power planesoffers distinct advantages:\n1. The minimization of the loop area encompassed by a signal\nand its return path.\n2. The minimization of the impedance associated with ground\nand power paths.\n3. The inherent distributed capacitor formed by the power plane,\nPCB insulation and ground plane.\nThese characteristics result in both a reduction of electro-\nmagnetic interference (EMI) and an overall improvement in\nperformance.\nIt is important to design a layout that prevents noise from cou-\npling onto the input signal. Digital signals should not be run inparallel with the input signal traces and should be routed away\nfrom the input circuitry. Separate analog and digital grounds\nshould be joined together directly under the AD9280 in a solidground plane. The power and ground return currents must be\ncarefully managed. A general rule of thumb for mixed signal\nlayouts dictates that the return currents from digital circuitryshould not pass through critical analog circuitry.DIGITAL OUTPUTS\nEach of the on-chip buffers for the AD9280 output bits(D0–D7) is powered from the DRVDD supply pins, separate\nfrom AVDD. The output drivers are sized to handle a variety\nof logic families while minimizing the amount of glitch energygenerated. In all cases, a fan-out of one is recommended to\nkeep the capacitive load on the output data bits below the speci-\nfied 20 pF level.\nFor DRVDD = 5 V, the AD9280 output signal swing is com-\npatible with both high speed CMOS and TTL logic families.\nFor TTL, the AD9280 on-chip, output drivers were designed to\nsupport several of the high speed TTL families (F, AS, S). Forapplications where the clock rate is below 32 MSPS, other TTL\nfamilies may be appropriate. For interfacing with lower voltage\nCMOS logic, the AD9280 sustains 32 MSPS operation withDRVDD = 3 V. In all cases, check your logic family data sheets\nfor compatibility with the AD9280 Digital Specification table.\nTHREE-STATE OUTPUTS\nThe digital outputs of the AD9280 can be placed in a high\nimpedance state by setting the THREE-STATE pin to HIGH.This feature is provided to facilitate in-circuit testing or evaluation.\nREV.
