A single\nsupply voltage of +2.7 V to +6.5 V at 16 mA is needed, corre-sponding to a power consumption of under 50 mW at 3 V, plus\nthe limiter bias current, determined by the application and typi-\ncally 2 mA, providing a limiter gain of 90 dB when using 200 W\nloads. A CMOS-compatible control interface can enable the\nAD8306 within about 500 ns and disable it to a standby current\nof under 1 mA.\nThe six cascaded amplifier/limiter cells in the main path have a\nsmall signal gain of 12.04 dB ( ·4), with a –3 dB bandwidth of\n850 MHz, providing a total gain of 72 dB. The programmable\noutput stage provides a further 18 dB of gain. The input is fullydifferential and presents a moderately high impedance (1 k W in\nparallel with 2.5 pF). The input-referred noise-spectral-density,\nwhen driven from a terminated 50 W, source is 1.28 nV/ ÖHz,\nequivalent to a noise figure of 3 dB. The sensitivity of the\nAD8306 can be raised by using an input matching network.\nEach of the main gain cells includes a full-wave detector.  An\nadditional four detectors, driven by a broadband attenuator, areused to extend the top end of the dynamic range by over 48 dB.The overall dynamic range for this combination extends from\n–91 dBV (–78 dBm at the 50 W level) to a maximum permissible\nvalue of +9 dBV, using a balanced drive of antiphase inputs each of\n2 V in amplitude, which would correspond to a sine wave power\nof +22 dBm if the differential input were terminated in 50 W.\nThrough laser trimming, the slope of the RSSI output is closely\ncontrolled to 20 mV/dB, while the intercept is set to –108 dBV\n(–95 dBm re 50 W). These scaling parameters are determined\nby a band-gap voltage reference and are substantially indepen-\ndent of temperature and supply.  The logarithmic law conform-\nance is typica lly within –0.4 dB over the central 80 dB of this\nrange at any frequency between 10 MHz and 200 MHz, and is\ndegraded only slightly at 400 MHz.\nThe RSSI response time is nominally 73 ns (10%–90%). The\naveraging time may be increased without limit by the addition ofan external capacitor. The full output of 2.34 V at the maximum\ninput of +9 dBV can drive any resistive load down to 50 W and\nthis interface remains stable with any value of capacitance onthe output.\nThe AD8306 is fabricated on an advanced complementary\nbipolar process using silicon-on-insulator isolation techniques\nand is available in the industrial temperature range of –40 °C to\n+85°C, in a 16-lead narrow body SO package. The AD8306 is\nalso available for the full military temperature range of –55 °C to\n+125°C, in a 16-lead side-brazed ceramic DIP.12dB LIM\nDET12dB\nDET DET 4 3 DETLADR ATTENINHI\nINLO\nI–VBIAS\nCTRL\nTEN DETECTORS SPACED 12dB\nINTERCEPT\nTEMP COMPBAND-GAP\nREFERENCEENBLGAIN\nBIASLMHI\nLMLO\nLMDR\nVLOG\nFLTRSIX STAGES TOTAL GAIN 72dB TYP GAIN 18dB\nSLOPE\nBIAS12dB\nREV.

A power level of 0 dBm (1 mW) in a 50 W termination corresponds to an input of 0.2236 V rms. Hence, in the special case of 50 W termination, dBV values\ncan be converted into dBm by adding a fixed offset of +13 to the dBV rms value.\n3Due to the extremely high Gain Bandwidth Product of the AD8306, the output of either LMHI or LMLO  will be unstable for levels below –78 dBV (–65 dBm, re 50 W).\n4Standard deviation remains essentially constant over frequency.

AAD8306\n–7–PRODUCT OVERVIEW\nThe AD8306 is built  on an advanced dielectrically-isolated\ncomplementary bipolar process using thin-film resistor technol-\nogy for accurate scaling. It follows well-developed foundations\nproven over a period of some fifteen years, with constant refine-ment. The backbone of the AD8306 (Figure 19) comprises a\nchain of six main amplifier/limiter stages, each having a gain of\n12.04 dB ( ·4) and small-signal –3 dB bandwidth of 850 MHz.\nThe input interface at INHI and INLO (Pins 4 and 5) is fully\ndifferential. Thus it may be driven from either single-sided or\nbalanced inputs, the latter being required at the very top end ofthe dynamic range, where the total differential drive may be as\nlarge as 4 V in amplitude.\nThe first six stages, also used in developing the logarithmic\nRSSI output, are followed by a versatile programmable-output,and thus programmable-gain, final limiter section. Its open-\ncollector outputs are also fully differential, at LMHI and LMLO\n(Pins 12 and 13). This output stage provides a gain of 18 dBwhen using equal valued load and bias setting resistors and the\npin-to-pin output is used. The  overall voltage gain is thus 90 dB.\nWhen using R\nLIM = R LOAD = 200 W, the additional current\nconsumption in the limiter is approximately 2.8 mA, of which\n2 mA goes to the load. The ratio depends on R LIM (for example,\nwhen 20 W, the efficiency is 90%), and the voltage at the pin\nLMDR is rather more than 400 mV, but the total load current\nis accurately (400 mV)/R LIM.\nThe rise and fall times of the hard-limited (essentially square-\nwave) voltage at the outputs are typically 0.6 ns, when driven bya sine wave input having an amplitude of 316 mV or greater, and\nR\nLOAD = 50 W. The change in time-delay (“phase skew”) over\nthe input range –73 dBV (316 mV in amplitude, or –60 dBm in\n50 W) to –3 dBV (1 V or +10 dBm) is –56 ps (–2° at 100 MHz).\n12dB LIM\nDET12dB\nDET DET 4 3 DETLADR ATTENINHI\nINLO\nI–VBIAS\nCTRL\nTEN DETECTORS SPACED 12dB\nINTERCEPT\nTEMP COMPBAND-GAP\nREFERENCEENBLGAIN\nBIASLMHI\nLMLO\nLMDR\nVLOG\nFLTRSIX STAGES TOTAL GAIN 72dB TYP GAIN 18dB\nSLOPE\nBIAS12dB\nFigure 19. Main Features of the AD8306\nThe six main cells and their associated full-wave detectors,\nhaving a transconductance (g m) form, handle the lower part of\nthe dynamic range. Biasing for these cells is provided by two\nreferences, one of which determines their gain, the other being aband-gap cell which determines the logarithmic slope, and sta-\nbilizes it against supply and temperature variations. A special\ndc-offset-sensing cell (not shown in Figure 19) is placed at theend of this main section, and used to null any residual offset at\nthe input, ensuring accurate response down to the noise floor.\nThe first amplifier stage provides a short-circuited voltage-noisespectral-density of 1.07 nV/ ÖHz.\nThe last detector stage includes a modification to temperature-\nstabilize the log-intercept, which is accurately positioned so as\nto make optimal use of the full output voltage range. Four fur-ther “top end” detectors are placed at 12.04 dB taps along a\npassive attenuator, to handle the upper part of the range. Thedifferential current-mode outputs of all ten detectors stages are\nsummed with equal weightings and converted to a single-sidedvoltage by the output stage, generating the logarithmic (or RSSI)\noutput at VLOG (Pin 16), nominally scaled 20 mV/dB (that is,\n400 mV per decade). The junction between the lower and upperregions is seamless, and the logarithmic law-conformance is\ntypically well within –0.4 dB over the 80 dB range from –80 dBV\nto 0 dBV (–67 dBm to +13 dBm).\nThe full-scale rise time of the RSSI output stage, which operates\nas a two-pole low-pass filter with a corner frequency of 3.5 MHz,\nis about 200 ns. A capacitor connected between FLTR (Pin 10)\nand VLOG can be used to lower the corner frequency (see be-low). The output has a minimum level of about 0.34 V (corre-\nsponding to a noise power of –78 dBm, or 17 dB above the\nnominal intercept of –95 dBm). This rather high baseline levelensures that the pulse response remains unimpaired at very low\ninputs.\nThe maximum RSSI output depends on the supply voltage and\nthe load. An output of 2.34 V, that is, 20 mV/dB · (9 + 108) dB, is\nguaranteed when using a supply voltage of 4.5 V or greater and\na load resistance of 50 W or higher, for a differential input of\n9 dBV (a 4 V sine amplitude, using balanced drives). Whenusing a 3 V supply, the maximum differential input may still be\nas high as –3 dBV (1 V sine amplitude), and the corresponding\nRSSI output of 2.1 V, that is, 20 mV/dB · (–3 + 108) dB is also\nguaranteed.\nA fully-programmable output interface is provided for the hard-\nlimited signal, permitting the user to establish the optimal output\ncurrent from its differential current-mode output. Its magnitudeis determined by the resistor R\nLIM placed between LMDR (Pin\n9) and ground, across which a nominal bias voltage of ~400 mV\nappears. Using R LIM = 200 W, this dc bias current, which is\ncommutated alternately to the output pins, LMHI  and LMLO,\nby the signal, is 2 mA. (The total supply current is somewhat\nhigher).\nThese currents may readily be converted to voltage form by the\ninclusion of load resistors, which will typically range from a few\ntens of ohms at 400 MHz to as high as 2 k W in lower frequency\napplications. Alternatively, a resonant load may be used to extractthe fundamental signal and modulation sidebands, minimizing\nthe out-of-band noise. A transformer or impedance matching\nnetwork may also be used at this output. The peak voltage swingdown from the supply voltage may be 1.2 V, before the output\ntransistors go into saturation. (The Applications section provides\nfurther information on the use of this interface).\nThe supply current for all sections except the limiter output\nstage, and with no load attached to the RSSI output, is nomi-\nnally 16 mA at T\nA = 27°C, substantially independent of supply\nvoltage. It varies in direct proportion to the absolute tempera-ture (PTAT).  The RSSI load current is simply the voltage at\nVLOG divided by the load resistance (e.g., 2.4 mA max in a\n1 kW load). The limiter supply current is 1.1 times that flowing\nin R\nLIM. The AD8306 may be enabled/disabled by a CMOS-\ncompatible level at ENBL (Pin 8).\nIn the following simplified interface diagrams, the components\ndenoted with an uppercase “R” are thin-film resistors having avery low temperature-coefficient of resistance and high linearity\nunder large-signal conditions. Their absolute value is typically\nwithin –20%. Capacitors denoted using an uppercase “C” have\na typical tolerance of –15% and essentially zero temperature or\nREV. AAD8306\n–8–voltage sensitivity. Most interfaces have additional small junc-\ntion capacitances associated with them, due to active devices or\nESD protection; these may be neither accurate nor stable.Component numbering in each of these interface diagrams is\nlocal.\nEnable Interface\nThe chip-enable interface is shown in Figure 20. The current in\nR1 controls the turn-on and turn-off states of the band-gap\nreference and the bias generator, and is a maximum of 100 mA\nwhen Pin 8 is taken to 5 V. Left unconnected, or at any voltagebelow 1 V, the AD8306 will be disabled, when it consumes a\nsleep current of much less than 1 mA (leakage currents only); when\ntied to the supply, or any voltage above 2 V, it will be fully enabled.The internal bias circuitry requires approximately 300 ns for\neither OFF or ON, while a delay of some 6 ms is required for the\nsupply current to fall below 10 mA.\n1.3k V\n50kV4kV\nCOMMENBL\nR1\n60kVTO BIAS\nENABLE\nFigure 20.

In most applications both input pins are ac-\ncoupled. The switch S closes when Enable is asserted. When\ndisabled, the inputs float, bias current I E is shut off, and the\ncoupling capacitors remain charged. If the log amp is disabled\nfor long periods, small leakage currents will discharge these\ncapacitors.

Signal Input Interface\nIn most applications, the input signal will be single-sided, and\nmay be applied to either Pin 4 or 5, with the remaining pin ac-coupled to ground. Under these conditions, the largest input\nsignal that can be handled is –3 dBV (sine amplitude of 1 V)\nwhen operating from a 3 V supply; a +3 dBV input may behandled using a supply of 4.5 V or greater. When using a fully-\nbalanced drive, the +3 dBV level may be achieved for the sup-plies down to 2.7 V and +9 dBV using >4.5 V. For frequencies\nin the range 10 MHz to 200 MHz these high drive levels are\neasily achieved using a matching network. Using such a net-work, having an inductor at the input, the input transient is\neliminated.\nLimiter Output Interface\nThe simplified limiter output stage is shown in Figure 22. Thebias for this stage is provided by a temperature-stable reference\nvoltage of nominally 400 mV which is forced across the exter-nal resistor R\nLIM connected from Pin 9 (LMDR, or limiter\ndrive) by a special op amp buffer stage. The biasing scheme\nalso introduces a slight “lift” to this voltage to compensate forthe finite current gain of the current source Q3 and the output\ntransistors Q1 and Q2. A maximum current of 10 mA is per-\nmissible (R\nLIM = 40 W). In special applications, it may be desir-\nable to modulate the bias current; an example of this is provided\nin the Applications section. Note that w hile the bias currents are\ntemperature stable, the ac gain of this stage will vary with tem-\nperature, by –6 dB over a 120 °C range.\nA pair of supply and temperature stable complementary cur-\nrents is generated at the differential output LMHI and LMLO\n(Pins 12 and 13), having a square wave form with rise and falltimes of typically 0.6 ns, when load resistors of 50 W are used.\nThe voltage at these output pins may swing to 1.2 V below the\nsupply voltage applied to VPS2 (Pin 15).\nBecause of the very high gain bandwidth product of this ampli-\nfier considerable care must be exercised in using the limiter\noutputs. The minimum necessary bias current and voltage\nswings should be used. These outputs are best utilized in afully-differential mode. A flux-coupled transformer, a balun, or\nan output matching network can be selected to transform these\nvoltages to a single-sided form. Equal load resistors are recom-mended, even when only one output pin is used, and these\nshould always be returned to the same well decoupled node on\nthe PC board. When the AD8306 is used only to generate anRSSI output, the limiter should be completely disabled by\nomitting R\nLIM and strapping LMHI  and LMLO to VPS2.\nOAVPS2 LMHI LMLO\nCOM1\nLMDR\nRLIM2.6k V 1.3k V 1.3k VQ1\n4e\nQ2\n4e\nQ31.3k V 1.3k V\nFROM FINAL\nLIMITER STAGE\n400mV\nZERO-TC\nFigure 22.

This scaling is controlled by a sepa-\nrate feedback stage, having a tightly controlled transcon-ductance.

Simplified RSSI Output Interface\nThe RSSI output bandwidth, f LP, is nominally 3.5 MHz. This is\ncontrolled by the compensation capacitor C1, which may beincreased by adding an external capacitor, C\nF, between FLTR\n(Pin 10) and VLOG (Pin 16). An external 33 pF will reduce f LP\nto 350 kHz, while 360 pF will set it to 35 kHz, in each case with\nan essentially one-pole response.

The incre-\nmental output resistance is approximately 0.3 W at low frequen-\ncies, rising to 1 W at 150 kHz and 18 W at very high frequencies.\nThe output is unconditionally stable with load capacitance, but\nit should be noted that while the peak sourcing current is\nover 100 mA, and able to rapidly charge even large capacitances,\nthe int ernally provided sinking current is only 1 mA. Thus, the\nfall time from the 2 V level will be as long as 2 ms for a 1 nF\nload. This may be reduced by adding a grounded load resistance.\nUSING THE AD8306\nThe AD8306 exhibits very high gain from 1 MHz to over 1 GHz,\nat which frequency the gain of the main path is still over 65 dB.Consequently, it is susceptible to all signals, within this very\nbroad frequency range, that find their way to the input termi-\nnals. It is important to remember that these are quite indistin-guishable from the “wanted” signal, and will have the effect of\nraising the apparent noise floor (that is, lowering the useful\ndynamic range). Therefore, while the signal of interest may bean IF of, say, 200 MHz, any of the following could easily be\nlarger than this signal at the lower extremities of its dynamicrange: a 60 Hz hum, picked up due to poor grounding tech-\nniques; spurious coupling from digital logic on the same PC\nboard; a strong EMI source; etc.\nVery careful shielding is essential to guard against such un-\nwanted signals, and also to minimize the likelihood of instabilitydue to HF feedback from the limiter outputs to the input. With\nthis in mind, the minimum possible limiter gain  should be used.\nWhere only the logarithmic amplifier (RSSI) function is re-quired, the limiter should be disabled by omitting R\nLIM and\ntying the outputs LMHI and LMLO directly to VPS2. A good\nground plane should be used to provide a low impedance con-nection to the common pins, for the decoupling capacitor(s)\nused at VPS1 and VPS2, and at the output ground. Note that\nCOM2 is a special ground pin serving just the RSSI output.\nThe four pins labeled PADL tie down directly to the metallic\nlead frame, and are thus connected to the back of the chip. The\nprocess on which the AD8306 is fabricated uses a bonded-wafer\ntechnique to provide a silicon-on-insulator isolation, and there isno junction or other dc path from the back side to the circuitry\non the surface. These paddle pins must be connected directly to\nthe ground plane using the shortest possible lead lengths tominimize inductance.\nThe voltages at the two supply pins should not be allowed to\ndiffer greatly; up to 500 mV is permissible. It is desirable to\nallow VPS1 to be slightly more negative than VPS2. When theprimary supply is greater than 2.7 V, the decoupling resistors R1\nand R2 (Figure 24) may be increased to improve the isolation\nand lower the dissipation in the IC. However, since VPS2 sup-ports the RSSI load current, which may be large, the value of\nR2 should take this into account.\nBasic Connections for Log (RSSI) Output\nFigure 24 shows the connections required for most applications.\nThe AD8306 is enabled by connecting ENBL to VPS1. The\ndevice is put into the sleep mode by grounding this pin. The\ninputs are ac-coupled by C1 and C2, which normally shouldhave the same value (C\nC). The input is, in this case, terminated\nwith a 52.3 W resistor that combines with the AD8306’s input\nresistance of 1000 W to give a broadband input impedance of\n50 W. Alternatively an input matching network can be used (see\nInput Matching section).\n1\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8VLOG\nVPS2\nPADL\nLMHI\nLMLO\nPADL\nFLTR\nLMDRCOM2\nVPS1\nPADL\nINHI\nINLO\nPADLCOM1\nENBLAD8306\n91011141516\n0.1mFR2\n10V\nRSSI\n0.1mFR1\n10V\nENABLERT\n52.3 VC1\n0.01 mF\nSIGNAL\nINPUTS1213VS (2.7V TO 6.5V)\nC2\n0.01 mFCF\n(OPTIONAL\nSEE TEXT)\nFigure 24.

Log Linearity vs. Input Level at T A = +25°C, for\nFrequencies of 10 MHz, 50 MHz and 100 MHz\nTransfer Function in Terms of Slope and Intercept\nThe transfer function of the AD8306 is characterized in terms\nof its Slope and Intercept. The logarithmic slope is defined asthe change in the RSSI output voltage for a 1 dB change at the\ninput. For the AD8306 the slope is calibrated to be 20 mV/dB.\nThe intercept is the point at which the extrapolated linear re-\nsponse would intersect the horizontal axis. For the AD8306 theintercept is calibrated to be –108 dBV (–95 dBm). Using the\nslope and intercept, the output voltage can be calculated for any\ninput level within the specified input range using the equation:\nV\nOUT = VSLOPE  · (PIN – PO) (2)where VOUT is the demodulated and filtered RSSI output,\nVSLOPE  is the logar ithmic slope, expressed in V/dB, PIN is the\ninput signal, expressed in decibels relative to some reference\nlevel (either dBm or dBV in this case) and PO is the logarithmic\nintercept, expressed in decibels relative to the same referencelevel.\nFor example, for an input level of –33 dBV (–20 dBm), the\noutput voltage will be\nV\nOUT = 0.02 V/dB  · (–33 dBV – (–108 dBV)) = 1.5 V (3)\nThe most widely used convention in RF systems is to specify\npower in dBm, that is, decibels above 1 mW in 50 W. Specifica-\ntion of log amp input level in terms of power is strictly a conces-\nsion to popular  convention; they do not respond to power (tacitly\n“power absorbed at the input”), but to the input voltage. Theuse of dBV, defined as decibels with respect to a 1 V rms sine wave ,\nis more precise, although this is still not unambiguous because\nwaveform is also involved in the response of a log amp, which,for a complex input (such as a CDMA signal) will not follow the\nrms value exactly. Since most users specify RF signals in terms\nof power—more specifically, in dBm/50 W—we use both dBV\nand dBm in specifying the performance of the AD8306, showing\nequivalent dBm levels for the special case of a 50 W environment.\nValues in dBV are converted to dBm re 50 W by adding 13.\nOutput Response Time and C F\nThe RSSI output has a low-pass corner frequency of 3.5 MHz,\nwhich results in a 10% to 90% rise time of 73 ns. For low fre-\nquency applications, the corner frequency can be reduced byadding an external capacitor, C\nF, between FLTR (Pin 10) and\nVLOG (Pin 16) as shown in Figure 24. For example, an exter-\nnal 33 pF will reduce the corner frequency to 350 kHz, while360 pF will set it to 35 kHz, in each case with an essentially\none-pole response.\nUsing the Limiter\nFigure 27 shows the basic connections for operating the limiter\nand the log output concurrently. The limiter output is a pair of\ndifferential currents of magnitude, I OUT, from high impedance\n(open-collector) sources. These are converted to equal-amplitudevoltages by supply-referenced load resistors, R\nLOAD. The limiter\noutput current is set by R LIM, the resistor connected between\nPin 9 (LMDR) and ground. The limiter output current is setaccording the equation:\nI\nOUT = –400 mV/RLIM (5)\nand has an absolute accuracy of –5%.\nThe supply referenced voltage on each of the limiter pins will\nthus be given by:\nVLIM = VS –400 mV · RLOAD/RLIM (6)\nREV.

Basic Connections for Operating the Limiter\nDepending on the application, the resulting voltage may be used\nin a fully balanced or unbalanced manner. It is good practice to\nretain both load resistors, even when only one output pin isused. These should always be returned to the same well de-\ncoupled node on the PC board (see layout of evaluation board).\nThe unbalanced, or single-sided mode, is more inclined to resultin instabilities caused by the very high gain of the signal path.\nThe limiter current may be set as high as 10 mA (which requires\nR\nLIM to be 40 W) and can be optionally increased somewhat\nbeyond this level. It is generally inadvisable, however, to use a\nhigh bias current, since the gain of this wide bandwidth signal\npath is proportional to the bias current, and the risk of instabil-ity is elevated as R\nLIM is reduced (recommended value is 400 W).\nHowever, as the size of R LOAD is increased, the bandwidth of the\nlimiter output decreases from 585 MHz for R LOAD = R LIM =\n50 W to 50 MHz for R LOAD = R LIM = 400 W (bandwidth =\n210 MHz for R LOAD = R LIM = 100 W and 100 MHz for R LOAD =\nRLIM = 200 W). As a result, the minimum necessary limiter\noutput level should be chosen while maintaining the requiredlimiter bandwidth. For R\nLIM = R LOAD = 50 W, the limiter output\nis specified for input levels between –78 dBV (–65 dBm) and\n+9 dBV (+22 dBm). The output of the limiter may be unstablefor levels below –78 dBV (–65 dBm). However, keeping R\nLIM\nabove 100 W will make instabilities on the output less likely for\ninput levels below –78 dBV.\nA transformer or a balun (e.g., MACOM part number ETC1-1-13)\ncan be used to convert the differential limiter output voltages to\na single-ended signal.\nInput Matching\nWhere either a higher sensitivity or a better high frequency\nmatch is required, an input matching network is valuable. Using\na flux-coupled transformer to achieve the impedance transfor-\nmation also eliminates the need for coupling capacitors, lowersany dc offset voltages generated directly at the input, and use-\nfully balances the drives to INHI and INLO, permitting full\nutilization of the unusually large input voltage capacity of theAD8306.\nThe choice of turns ratio will depend somewhat on the fre-\nquency. At frequencies below 30 MHz, the reactance of the\ninput capacitance is much higher than the real part of the inputimpedance. In this frequency range, a turns ratio of 2:9 will\nlower the effective input impedance to 50 W while raising the\ninput voltage by 13 dB. However, this does not lower the effectof the short circuit noise voltage by the same factor, since therewill be a contribution from the input noise current. Thus, the\ntotal noise  will be reduced by a smaller factor. The intercept at\nthe primary input will be lowered to –121 dBV (–108 dBm).\nImpedance matching and drive balancing using a flux-coupled\ntransformer is useful whenever broadband coupling is required.\nHowever, this may not always be convenient. At high frequen-cies, it will often be preferable to use a narrow-band matching\nnetwork, as shown in Figure 28, which has several advantages.\nFirst, the same voltage gain can be achieved, providing increasedsensitivity , but now a measure of selectively  is simultaneously\nintroduced. Second, the component count is low: two capacitors\nand an inexpensive chip inductor are needed. Third, the net-work also serves as a balun. Analysis of this network shows that\nthe amplitude of the voltages at INHI and INLO are quite simi-\nlar when the impedance ratio is fairly high (i.e., 50 W to 1000 W).\n1\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8VLOG\nVPS2\nPADL\nLMHI\nLMLO\nPADL\nFLTR\nLMDRCOM2\nVPS1\nPADLINHI\nINLOPADL\nCOM1\nENBLAD8306\n91011141516\n0.1mF10V\nNC\nRLIMRSSI\nLIMITER\nOUTPUT0.1mF10V\nC2 = CMZIN\nNC = NO CONNECT1213VS\nC1 = CM\nLM\nFigure 28.

For example, at fC = 100 MHz, LIN = 1 mH.Step 2: Calculate C O and L O\nNow having a purely resistive input impedance, we can calculate\nthe nominal coupling elements C O and L O, using\n    C\nfR RLRR\nfO\nCI N MOIN M\nC=\n()=() 1\n22pp;(8)\nFor the AD8306, R IN is 1 kW. Thus, if a match to 50 W is\nneeded, at f C = 100 MHz, C O must be 7.12 pF and L O must be\n356 nH.\nStep 3: Split C O Into Two Parts\nSince we wish to provide the fully-balanced form of network\nshown in Figure 28, two capacitors C1 = C2  each of nominally\ntwice C O, shown as C M in the figure, can be used. This requires\na value of 14.24 pF in this example. Under these conditions, thevoltage amplitudes at INHI and INLO will be similar. A some-\nwhat better balance in the two drives may be achieved when C1\nis made slightly larger than C2, which also allows a wider rangeof choices in selecting from standard values. For example, ca-\npacitors of C1 = 15 pF and C2 = 13 pF may be used (making\nC\nO = 6.96 pF).\nStep 4:  Calculate L M\nThe matching inductor required to provide both L IN and L O is\njust the parallel combination of these:\nLM = L INLO/(LIN + LO) (9)\nWith LIN = 1 mH and LO = 356 nH, the value of LM to complete\nthis example of a match of 50 W at 100 MHz is 262.5 nH. The\nnearest standard value of 270 nH may be used with only a slight\nloss of matching accuracy.

AAD8306\n–13–10 mV/dB The AD8031 rail-to-rail op amp, used in both ex-\namples, can swing from 50 mV to 4.95 mV on a single +5 Vsupply. If high output current is required (> 10 mA), the AD8051,\nwhich also has rail-to-rail capab ility but can deliver up to 45 mA\nof output current, can be used.\nAPPLICATIONS\nThe AD8306 is a versatile and easily applied log-limiting ampli-fier. Being complete, it can be used with very few external com-\nponents, and most applications can be accommodated using the\nsimple connections shown in the preceding section. A few ex-amples of more specialized applications are provided here.\nHigh Output Limiter Loading\nThe AD8306 can generate a fairly large output power at itsdifferential limiter output interface. This may be coupled into a50 W grounded load using the narrow-band coupling network\nfollowing similar lines to those provided for input matching.\nAlternatively, a flux-linked transformer, having a center-tappedprimary, may be used. Even higher output powers can be ob-\ntained using emitter-followers. In Figure 31, the supply voltage\nto the AD8306 is dropped from 5 V to about 4.2 V, by thediode. This increases the available swing at each output to about\n2 V. Taking both outputs differentially, a square wave output of\n4 V p-p can be generated.\n1\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8VLOG\nVPS2\nPADL\nLMHI\nLMLO\nPADL\nFLTR\nLMDRCOM2\nVPS1\nPADLINHI\nINLOPADL\nCOM1\nENBLAD8306\n91011141516\n0.1mF10V\nRLIMRSSI\n3V TO 5V0.1mF10V\n1213+5VIN914\nAPPROX. 4.2V\nRLOAD\nSET RL = 5*RLIM\n5V TO 3V\nDIFFERENTIAL\nOUTPUT = 4V pk-pkRLOAD\nFigure 31. Increasing Limiter Output Voltage\nWhen operating at high output power levels and high frequen-\ncies, very careful attention must be paid to the issue of stability.\nOscillation is likely to be observed when the input signal level islow, due to the extremely high gain-bandwidth product of the\nAD8306 under such conditions. These oscillations will be less\nevident when signal-balancing networks are used, operating atfrequencies below 200 MHz, and they will generally be fully\nquenched by the signal at input levels of a few dB above the\nnoise floor.\nModulated Limiter Output\nThe limiter output stage of the AD8306 also provides an analog\nmultiplication capability: the amplitude of the output square\nwave can be controlled by the current withdrawn from LMDR(Pin 9). An analog control input of 0 V to +1 V is used to gener-\nate an exactly-proportional current of 0 mA to 10 mA in the npn\ntransistor, whose collector is held at a fixed voltage of ~400 mV\nby the internal bias in the AD8306. When the input signal is\nabove the limiting threshold, the output will then be a square-\nwave whose amplitude is proportional to the control bias.1\n23\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8VLOG\nVPS2\nPADL\nLMHI\nLMLO\nPADL\nFLTR\nLMDRCOM2\nVPS1\nPADLINHI\nINLOPADL\nCOM1\nENBLAD8306\n9101114151610V 10V\n1213VS\n1.8k VAD80310.1mFRSSI\n0.1mF\nVARIABLE\nOUTPUT8.2k V0V TO +1V\n18V 0mA TO\n10mA2N39040.1mF\nFigure 32. Variable Limiter Output Programming\nEffect of Waveform Type on Intercept\nThe AD8306 fundamentally responds to voltage and not to\npower. A direct consequence of this characteristic is that input\nsignals of equal rms power, but differing crest factors, will pro-\nduce different results at the log amp’s output.\nThe effect of differing signal waveforms is to shift the effective\nvalue of the log amp’s intercept. Graphically, this looks like a\nvertical shift in the log amp’s transfer function. The device’s\nlogarithmic slope however is not affected. For example, considerthe case of the AD8306 being alternately fed by an unmodu-\nlated sine wave and by a single CDMA channel of the same rms\npower. The AD8306’s output voltage will differ by the equiva-lent of 3.55 dB (71 mV) over the complete dynamic range of the\ndevice (the output for a CDMA input being lower).\nTable II shows the correction factors that should be applied to\nmeasure the rms signal strength of a various signal types. A sine\nwave input is used as a reference.  To measure the rms power of\na square wave, for example, the mV equivalent of the dB value\ngiven in the table (20 mV/dB times 3.01 dB) should be sub-tracted from the output voltage of the AD8306.\nTable II.
