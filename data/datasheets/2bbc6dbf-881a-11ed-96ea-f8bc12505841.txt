At approximately 150° C, which is the  \nglass transition temperature, the properties of the plastic cha nge. \nEven temporarily exceeding this temperature limit can change \nthe stresses that the package exerts on the die, permanently \nshifting the parametric performance of the ADA4895- 1/ \nADA4895- 2. Exceeding a junction  temperature of 175° C for an \nextended period of time can result in changes in silicon devices, potentially causing degradation or loss of functionality.  \nThe power dissipated in the package (P\nD) is the sum of the \nquiescent power dissipation and the power dissipated in the  \ndie due to the ADA4895- 1/ADA4895- 2 drive at the output.  PD = Quiescent  Power  + (Total  Drive  Power  − Load Power ) \nThe quiescent power dissipation is the voltage between the supply  \npins (±V S) multiplied by the quiescent current (I S). \n()\nLOUT\nLOUT S\nS S DRV\nRV VI V P2\n2−\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb×+×=  \nConsider rms output voltages. If R L is referenced to −V S, as in \nsingle -supply operation, the total drive power is V S × I OUT. In \nsingle -supply operation with R L referenced to −V S, the worst \ncase is V OUT = V S/2. \nIf the rms signal levels are indeterminate, consider the worst case,  \nwhen V OUT = V S/4 with R L referenced to midsupply.  \n()()\nLS\nS S DRVI V P24/+×=  \nAirflow increases heat dissipation, effectively reducing θ JA.

Using the Analog Devices XFCB3 process, the \nADA4895-1 /ADA4895-2  have a gain band width product in \nexcess of 1.5 GHz and are gain ≥ 10 stable, with an input \nstructure that re sults in an extremely low input 1/f noise for a \nrelatively high speed amplifier.  \nThe rail -to-rail output stage is designed to drive the heavy feedback  \nload required to achieve an overall low output referred noise. \nThe low input noise and high bandwidth of the ADA4895-1 / \nADA4895-2  are achieved with minimal power penalty. For this \nreason, the maxi mum offset voltage of 350  µV and voltage drift \nof 0.15 µV/°C make the ADA4895-1 /ADA4895-2  an excellent \nchoice,  even when the low noise performance of the amplifier is \nnot needed.  \nFor any gain greater than 10, the closed -loop frequency response \nof a basic noninverting configuration can be approximated by  \nClosed- Loop −3 dB Frequency  = (GBP) × ( )G FG\nR RR\n+\nF\nor inverting gain configurations, the source impedance must be \nconsidered when sizing R G to maintain the minimum stable gain.  \nFor gains lower than 10, see the Using the ADA4895 -1/ADA4895- 2 \nat a Gain  < +10 section, or use the  ADA4897 -1/ADA4897-2 , which \nis a unity -gain stable amplifier with 230 MHz bandwidth.  \nINPUT PROTECTION \nThe ADA4895-1 /ADA4895 -2 are fully protect ed from ESD events \nand can with stand human body model ESD events of 2.5 kV and \ncharged -device model events of 1 kV with no measured performance \ndegradation. The precision input is protected with an ESD network \nbetween the  power supplies and diode clamps ac ross the input \ndevice pair, as shown in Figure 44. \n+INESD\nESD\n–VS+VS\nBIAS\nTO THE REST OF THE AMPLIFIER–INESD\nESD\n10186-040\nF\nigure 44. Input Stage and Protection Diodes A\nt differential voltages above approximately 0.7 V , the diode \nclamps begin to conduct. Too much current can cause damage due to excessive heating. If large differential voltages must be sustained across the input terminals, it is recommended that the curre nt through the input clamps be limited to less than 10  mA. \nSeries input resistors that are sized appropriately for the expected  \ndifferential overvoltage provide the needed protection.  \nThe ESD clamps begin to conduct at input voltages that are more  \nthan 0.7  V above the positive supply or more than 0.7  V below \nthe negative supply. If an overvoltage condition is expected, it is recommended that the fault current be limited to less than 10  mA. \nDISABLE OPERATION  \nFigure 45 shows the ADA4895-1 /ADA4895-2  power -down \ncircuitry . If the DISABLEx  pin is left unconnected, the base of the  \ninput PNP transistor is pulled high through the internal pull -up \nresistor to the positive supply and the device  is turned on. Pulling  \nthe DISABLEx  pin mor e than 2 V below the positive supply turns  \nthe device  off, reducing the supply current to approximately \n50 µA for a 5  V voltage supply.  \n+VS\n–VSDISABLExESD\nESDIBIAS\nTO\nAMPLIFIER\nBIAS\n10186-041\nF\nigure 45. DISABLEx  Circuit  \nThe DISABLEx  pin is protected by ESD clamps, as shown in \nFigure 45 . Voltages beyond the power supplies cause these diodes  \nto conduct. For protection of the DISABLEx  pins, the voltage to \nthese pins should not exceed 0.7 V beyond the supply voltage, or  \nthe input current should be restricted to less than 10 mA with a \nseries resistor. \nRev.

B | Page 21 of 24 WIDEBAND PHOTOMULTIPLIER PREAMPLIFIER \nA decompensated amplifier can provide significantly greater \nspeed in transimpedance applications than a unity-gain stable \namplifier. The speed increases by the square root of the ratio of the bandwidth of the two amplifiers; that is, a 1 GHz GBP amplifier \nis 10 times faster than a 10 MHz amplifier in the same trans-\nimpedance application if all other parameters are kept constant. Additionally, the input voltage noise normally dominates the total output rms noise because it is multiplied by the capacitive \nnoise gain network. \n\uf028 \uf029\nFD F M S\nCC C C C\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\n \nIn the case of the ADA4895-1 /ADA4895-2 , the input noise is \nlow, but the capacitive noise gain network must be kept greater than 10 for stability reasons. \nOne disadvantage of using the ADA4895-1 /ADA4895-2  in \ntransimpedance applications is that the input current and input \ncurrent noise can create large offsets and output voltage noise \nwhen coupled with an excessively high feedback resistance. Despite \nthese two issues, the ADA4895-1 /ADA4895-2  noise and gain \nbandwidth can provide a significant increase in performance \nwithin certain transimpedance ranges. \nFigure 55 shows an I/V converter with an electrical model of a \nphotomultiplier. \n–\n+VOUT\nVB\nCF+CSCDCM\nCM\nRFRSHCS IPHOTOCF\nRF\n10186-050 \nFigure 55.

Stray capacitance  \ncreated between the ground plane and the input and output pads of a device is detrimental  to high speed amplifier performance . Stray  \ncapacitance at the inverting input, along with the amplifier input \ncapacitance, lowers the phase margin and can cause instability. Stray capacitance at the output creates a pole in the feedback loop, which can re duce phase margin and can cause the circuit \nto become unstable.  \nPower Supply Bypassing  \nPower supply bypassing is a critical aspect in the performance \nof the ADA4895 -1/ADA4895- 2. A parallel connection of capacitors  \nfrom each  power supply pin to ground works best. Smaller value \ncapacitor electrolytics offer better high frequency response, whereas  \nlarger  value capaci tor electrolytics offer better low frequency \nperformance.  Paralleling different values and sizes of capacitors helps to ensure  \nthat the power supply pins are provided with low ac impedance \nacross a wide band of frequencies. This is important for minimizing  \nthe coupling of noise into the amplifier —especially when the \namplifier PSRR begins to roll off —because the bypass capacitors \ncan help lessen the degradation in PSRR performance.  \nPlace the smallest value capacitor on the same side of the board as the ampli fier and as close as possible to the amplifier power \nsupply pins. Connect the ground end of the capacitor directly to the ground plane.  \nIt is recommended that a 0.1 µF ceramic capacitor with a 0508 case  \nsize be used. The 0508 case size offers low series in ductance  and \nexcellent high frequency performance. Place a 10  µF electro lytic \ncapacitor in parallel with the 0.1 µF capacitor. Depending on the  \ncircuit parameters, some enhancement to performance can be realized by adding additional capacitors. Each circui t is different \nand should be analyzed individually for optimal performance.  \n \n \n \n \nRev.
