A constant-frequency current mode architecture allows a phase-lockable frequency of up to 650kHz. \nThe 80μA no-load quiescent current extends operating \nlife in battery powered systems. OPTI-LOOP compensa-tion allows the transient response to be optimized over a wide range of output capacitance and ESR values. The L TC3835-1 features a precision 0.8V reference and a power good output indicator . The 4V to 36V input supply range encompasses a wide range of battery chemistries.\nThe TRACK/SS pin ramps the output voltage during start-\nup.

Forcing this pin below 0.7V shuts down all controller functions, reducing the quiescent current that the L TC3835-1 draws to approximately 10μA.\nSENSE\n– (Pin 14/Pin 14):  The (–) Input to the Differential \nCurrent Comparator .\nSENSE+ (Pin 15/Pin 15):  The (+) Input to the Differential \nCurrent Comparator . The I TH pin voltage and controlled \noffsets between the SENSE– and SENSE+ pins in conjunc-\ntion with R SENSE  set the current trip threshold.\nPLLIN/MODE (Pin 16/Pin 16):  External Synchronization \nInput to Phase Detector and Forced Continuous Control Input. When an external clock is applied to this pin, the \nphase-locked loop will force the rising TG signal to be synchronized with the rising edge of the external clock. In this case, an R-C ﬁ  lter must be connected to the PLLLPF \npin. When not synchronizing to an external clock, this input determines how the L TC3835-1 operates at light loads. Pulling this pin below 0.7V selects Burst Mode operation. Tying this pin to INTV\nCC forces continuous inductor current \noperation. Tying this pin to a voltage greater than 0.9V and less than INTV\nCC selects pulse-skipping operation.\nExposed Pad (Pin 17, DHC Package):  SGND.

During normal operation, each external top MOSFET is turned on when the clock sets the RS latch, and is turned off when the main current compara-tor , ICMP , resets the RS latch. The peak inductor current \nat which ICMP trips and resets the latch is controlled by the voltage on the I\nTH pin, which is the output of the error \nampliﬁ  er EA. The error ampliﬁ  er compares the output volt-\nage feedback signal at the V FB pin, (which is generated with \nan external resistor divider connected across the output voltage, V\nOUT , to ground) to the internal 0.800V reference \nvoltage. When the load current increases, it causes a slight decrease in V\nFB relative to the reference, which cause the \nEA to increase the I TH voltage until the average inductor \ncurrent matches the new load current.\nAfter the top MOSFET is turned off each cycle, the bottom \nMOSFET is turned on until either the inductor current starts to reverse, as indicated by the current comparator IR, or the beginning of the next clock cycle.\nINTV\nCC Power\nPower for the top and bottom MOSFET drivers and most \nother internal circuitry is derived from the INTV CC pin. \nAn internal 5.25V low dropout linear regulator supplies INTV\nCC power from V IN.\nThe top MOSFET driver is biased from the ﬂ  oating bootstrap \ncapacitor C B, which normally  recharges during each off \ncycle through an external diode when the top MOSFET turns off. If the input voltage V\nIN decreases to a voltage \nclose to V OUT , the loop may enter dropout and attempt \nto turn on the top MOSFET continuously. The dropout detector detects this and forces the top MOSFET off for about one twelfth of the clock period every tenth cycle to allow C\nB to recharge.Shutdown and Start-Up (RUN and TRACK/SS Pins)\nThe L TC3835-1 can be shut down using the RUN pin. Pulling \nthis pin below 0.7V shuts down the main control loop for the controller . A low disables the controller and most internal circuits, including the INTV\nCC regulator , at which time the \nL TC3835-1 draws only 10μA of quiescent current.\nReleasing the RUN pin allows an internal 0.5μA current \nto pull up the pin and enable that controller . Alternatively, the RUN pin may be externally pulled up or driven directly by logic. Be careful not to exceed the Absolute Maximum rating of 7V on this pin.\nThe start-up of the output voltage V\nOUT is controlled by \nthe voltage on the TRACK/SS pin. When the voltage on the TRACK/SS pin is less than the 0.8V internal reference, the L TC3835-1 regulates the V\nFB voltage to the TRACK/SS \npin voltage instead of the 0.8V reference. This allows the TRACK/SS pin to be used to program a soft-start by connecting an external capacitor from the TRACK/SS pin to SGND. An internal 1μA pull-up current charges this capacitor creating a voltage ramp on the TRACK/SS pin. As the TRACK/SS voltage rises linearly from 0V to 0.8V (and beyond), the output voltage V\nOUT rises smoothly \nfrom zero to its ﬁ  nal value.\nAlternatively the TRACK/SS pin can be used to cause the \nstart-up of V OUT to “track” that of another supply. Typi-\ncally, this requires connecting to the TRACK/SS pin an external resistor divider from the other supply to ground (see Applications Information section).\nWhen the RUN pin is pulled low to disable the L TC3835-1, \nor when V\nIN drops below its undervoltage lockout thresh-\nold of 3.5V , the TRACK/SS pin is pulled low by an internal MOSFET . When in undervoltage lockout, the controller is disabled and the external MOSFETs are held off.\nLTC3835-1\n1038351fc OPERATION (Refer to Functional Diagram)\nLight Load Current Operation (Burst Mode Operation, \nPulse-Skipping, or Continuous Conduction) (PLLIN/MODE Pin)\nThe L TC3835-1 can be enabled to enter high efﬁ  ciency \nBurst Mode operation, constant-frequency pulse-skipping mode, or forced continuous conduction mode at low load currents. To select Burst Mode operation, tie the PLLIN/MODE pin to a DC voltage below 0.8V (e.g., SGND). To select forced continuous operation, tie the PLLIN/MODE pin to INTVCC. To select pulse-skipping mode, tie the PLLIN/MODE pin to a DC voltage greater than 0.8V and less than INTV\nCC – 0.5V .\nWhen the L TC3835-1 is enabled for Burst Mode operation, \nthe peak current in the inductor is set to approximately one-tenth of the maximum sense voltage even though the voltage on the I\nTH pin indicates a lower value. If the aver-\nage inductor current is lower than the load current, the error ampliﬁ  er EA will decrease the voltage on the I\nTH pin. \nWhen the I TH voltage drops below 0.4V , the internal sleep \nsignal goes high (enabling “sleep” mode) and both external MOSFETs are turned off. The I\nTH pin is then disconnected \nfrom the output of the EA and “parked” at 0.425V .\nIn sleep mode, much of the internal circuitry is turned off, \nreducing the quiescent current that the L TC3835-1 draws to only 80μA. In sleep mode, the load current is supplied by the output capacitor . As the output voltage decreases, the EA’s output begins to rise. When the output voltage drops enough, the I\nTH pin is reconnected to the output \nof the EA, the sleep signal goes low, and the controller resumes normal operation by turning on the top external MOSFET on the next cycle of the internal oscillator .\nWhen the L TC3835-1 is enabled for Burst Mode operation, \nthe inductor current is not allowed to reverse. The reverse current comparator (IR) turns off the bottom external MOSFET just before the inductor current reaches zero, preventing it from reversing and going negative, thus operating in discontinuous operation.\nIn forced continuous operation, the inductor current is \nallowed to reverse at light loads or under large transient conditions. The peak inductor current is determined by the voltage on the I\nTH pin, just as in normal operation. In this \nmode, the efﬁ  ciency at light loads is lower than in Burst Mode operation. However , continuous operation has the \nadvantages of lower output ripple and less interference to audio circuitry. In forced continuous mode, the output ripple is independent of load current.\nWhen the PLLIN/MODE pin is connected for pulse-skip-\nping mode or clocked by an external clock source to use the phase-locked loop (see Frequency Selection and Phase-Locked Loop section), the L TC3835-1 operates in PWM pulse-skipping mode at light loads. In this mode, constant-frequency operation is maintained down to ap-proximately 1% of designed maximum output current. At very light loads, the current comparator ICMP may remain tripped for several cycles and force the external top MOSFET to stay off for the same number of cycles (i.e., skipping pulses). The inductor current is not allowed to reverse (discontinuous operation). This mode, like forced continuous operation, exhibits low output ripple as well as low audio noise and reduced RF interference as compared to Burst Mode operation. It provides higher low current efﬁ  ciency than forced continuous mode, but not nearly as high as Burst Mode operation.\nFrequency Selection and Phase-Locked Loop \n(PLLLPF and PLLIN/MODE Pins)\nThe selection of switching frequency is a tradeoff between \nefﬁ  ciency and component size. Low frequency opera-tion increases efﬁ  ciency by reducing MOSFET switching \nlosses, but requires larger inductance and/or capacitance to maintain low output ripple voltage.\nThe switching frequency of the L TC3835-1’s controllers \ncan be selected using the PLLLPF pin.\nIf the PLLIN/MODE pin is not being driven by an external clock \nsource, the PLLLPF pin can be ﬂ  oated, tied to INTV\nCC, or tied \nto SGND to select 400kHz, 530kHz or 250kHz, respectively.\nA phase-locked loop (PLL) is available on the L TC3835-1 \nto synchronize the internal oscillator to an external clock source that is connected to the PLLIN/MODE pin. In this case, a series R-C should be connected between the PLLLPF pin and SGND to serve as the PLL ’s loop ﬁ  lter . The L TC3835-1 phase detector adjusts the voltage on the PLLLPF pin to align the turn-on of the external top MOSFET to the rising edge of the synchronizing signal. \nLTC3835-1\n1138351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION OPERATION (Refer to Functional Diagram)\nThe typical capture range of the L TC3835-1’s phase-\nlocked loop is from approximately 115kHz to 800kHz, with a guarantee to be between 140kHz and 650kHz. In other words, the L TC3835-1’s PLL is guaranteed to lock to an external clock source whose frequency is between 140kHz and 650kHz.\nThe typical input clock thresholds on the PLLIN/MODE \npin are 1.6V (rising) and 1.2V (falling).Output Overvoltage Protection\nAn overvoltage comparator guards against transient over-\nshoots as well as other more serious conditions that may overvoltage the output. When the V\nFB pin rises to more \nthan 10% higher than its regulation point of 0.800V , the top MOSFET is turned off and the bottom MOSFET is turned on until the overvoltage condition is cleared.\nR\nSENSE  Selection for Output Current\nRSENSE  is chosen based on the required output current. \nThe current comparator has a maximum threshold of 100mV/R\nSENSE  and an input common mode range of \nSGND to 10V . The current comparator threshold sets the peak of the inductor current, yielding a maximum average output current I\nMAX equal to the peak value less half the \npeak-to-peak ripple current, ΔIL.\nAllowing a margin for variations in the IC and external \ncomponent values yields:\n RmV\nISENSE\nMAX=80\nWhen using the controller in very low dropout conditions, \nthe maximum output current level will be reduced due to the internal compensation required to meet stability criterion for buck regulators operating at greater than 50% duty factor . A curve is provided to estimate this reduction in peak output current level depending upon the operating duty factor .\nOperating Frequency and Synchronization\nThe choice of operating frequency, is a trade-off between \nefﬁ  ciency and component size. Low frequency operation improves efﬁ  ciency by reducing MOSFET switching losses, \nboth gate charge loss and transition loss. However , lower frequency operation requires more inductance for a given amount of ripple current.The internal oscillator of the L TC3835-1 runs at a nominal \n400kHz frequency when the PLLLPF pin is left ﬂ  oating \nand the PLLIN/MODE pin is a DC low or high. Pulling the PLLLPF to INTV\nCC selects 530kHz operation; pulling the \nPLLLPF to SGND selects 250kHz operation.\nAlternatively, the L TC3835-1 will phase-lock to a clock \nsignal applied to the PLLIN/MODE pin with a frequency between 140kHz and 650kHz (see Phase-Locked Loop and Frequency Synchronization).\nInductor Value Calculation\nThe operating frequency and inductor selection are inter-\nrelated in that higher operating frequencies allow the use of smaller inductor and capacitor values. So why would anyone ever choose to operate at lower frequencies with larger components? The answer is efﬁ  ciency. A higher \nfrequency generally results in lower efﬁ  ciency because \nof MOSFET gate charge losses. In addition to this basic trade-off, the effect of inductor value on ripple current and low current operation must also be considered.\nThe inductor value has a direct effect on ripple current. \nThe inductor ripple current ΔI\nL decreases with higher \ninductance or frequency and increases with higher V IN:\n ΔIfLVV\nVL OUTOUT\nIN=() ( )⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟11–\nLTC3835-1\n1238351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nAccepting larger values of ΔIL allows the use of low \ninductances, but results in higher output voltage ripple and greater core losses. A reasonable starting point for setting ripple current is ΔI\nL = 0.3(I MAX). The maximum \nΔIL occurs at the maximum input voltage.\nThe inductor value also has secondary effects. The tran-\nsition to Burst Mode operation begins when the average inductor current required results in a peak current below 10% of the current limit determined by R\nSENSE . Lower \ninductor values (higher ΔIL) will cause this to occur at \nlower load currents, which can cause a dip in efﬁ  ciency in \nthe upper range of low current operation. In Burst Mode operation, lower inductance values will cause the burst frequency to decrease.\nInductor Core Selection\nOnce the value for L is known, the type of inductor must \nbe selected. High efﬁ  ciency converters generally cannot \nafford the core loss found in low cost powdered iron cores, forcing the use of more expensive ferrite or molypermalloy cores. Actual core loss is independent of core size for a ﬁ  xed inductor value, but it is very dependent on inductance selected. As inductance increases, core losses go down. Unfortunately, increased inductance requires more turns of wire and therefore copper losses will increase.\nFerrite designs have very low core loss and are preferred \nat high switching frequencies, so design goals can con-centrate on copper loss and preventing saturation. Ferrite core material saturates “hard,” which means that induc-tance collapses abruptly when the peak design current is exceeded. This results in an abrupt increase in inductor ripple current and consequent output voltage ripple. Do not allow the core to saturate!Power MOSFET and Schottky Diode (Optional) \nSelection\nT wo external power MOSFETs must be selected for each \ncontroller in the L TC3835-1: One N-channel MOSFET for the top (main) switch, and one N-channel MOSFET for the bottom (synchronous) switch.\nThe peak-to-peak drive levels are set by the INTV\nCC voltage. \nThis voltage is typically 5V during start-up (see EXTV CC \nPin Connection). Consequently, logic-level threshold MOSFETs must be used in most applications. The only exception is if low input voltage is expected (V\nIN < 5V); \nthen, sub-logic level threshold MOSFETs (V GS(TH)  < 3V) \nshould be used. Pay close attention to the BV   speciﬁ  cation \nfor the MOSFETs as well; most of the logic level MOSFETs are limited to 30V or less.\nSelection criteria for the power MOSFETs include the “ON” \nresistance R\nDS(ON) , Miller capacitance C MILLER , input \nvoltage and maximum output current. Miller capacitance, C\nMILLER , can be approximated from the gate charge curve \nusually provided on the MOSFET manufacturers’ data sheet. C\nMILLER  is equal to the increase in gate charge \nalong the horizontal axis while the curve is approximately ﬂ  at divided by the speciﬁ  ed change in V\nDS. This result is \nthen multiplied by the ratio of the application applied V DS \nto the Gate charge curve speciﬁ  ed V DS. When the IC is \noperating in continuous mode the duty cycles for the top and bottom MOSFETs are given by:\n Main Switch Duty CycleVIN\xa0\xa0 \xa0 \xa0 = \xa0V\nSynchronousOUT\n\xa0 \xa0Switch\xa0Duty\xa0Cycle\xa0=\xa0VIN–V\nVOUT\nIN\nLTC3835-1\n1338351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe MOSFET power dissipations at maximum output \ncurrent are given by:\n PV\nVIR\nVIMAINOUT\nINMAX DS ON\nINMAX= () +() +\n()2\n21δ()\n22\n11⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟() ( )\n+RC\nVVVDR MILLER\nINTVCC THMIN TH•\n–MMIN\nSYNCIN OUT\nINMAXf\nPVV\nVII R⎡\n⎣⎢⎤\n⎦⎥()\n= () +()– 2δDDS ON()\nwhere δ is the temperature dependency of R DS(ON)  and \nRDR (approximately 2Ω) is the effective driver resistance \nat the MOSFET ’s Miller threshold voltage. V THMIN  is the \ntypical MOSFET minimum threshold voltage.\nBoth MOSFETs have I2R losses while the topside N-channel \nequation includes an additional term for transition losses, which are highest at high input voltages. For V\nIN < 20V \nthe high current efﬁ  ciency generally improves with larger \nMOSFETs, while for V IN > 20V the transition losses rapidly \nincrease to the point that the use of a higher R DS(ON)  device \nwith lower C MILLER  actually provides higher efﬁ  ciency. The \nsynchronous MOSFET losses are greatest at high input voltage when the top switch duty factor is low or during a short-circuit when the synchronous switch is on close to 100% of the period.\nThe term (1 + δ) is generally given for a MOSFET in the \nform of a normalized R\nDS(ON)  vs Temperature curve, but \nδ = 0.005/°C can be used as an approximation for low \nvoltage MOSFETs. \nThe optional Schottky diode D1 shown in Figure 8 conducts \nduring the dead-time between the conduction of the two power MOSFETs. This prevents the body diode of the bottom MOSFET from turning on, storing charge during the dead-time and requiring a reverse recovery period that could cost as much as 3% in efﬁ  ciency at high V\nIN. A 1A \nto 3A Schottky is generally a good compromise for both regions of operation due to the relatively small average current. Larger diodes result in additional transition losses due to their larger junction capacitance.\nC\nIN and C OUT Selection\nIn continuous mode, the source current of the top MOSFET \nis a square wave of duty cycle (V OUT)/(VIN). To prevent \nlarge voltage transients, a low ESR capacitor sized for the maximum RMS current of one channel must be used. The maximum RMS capacitor current is given by:\n \nC \xa0Required\xa0IIN RMS ≈ () ( )⎡⎣I\nVVV VMAX\nINOUT IN OUT – ⎤⎤⎦12/\nThis formula has a maximum at V IN = 2V OUT , where I RMS \n= IOUT/2. This simple worst-case condition is commonly \nused for design because even signiﬁ  cant deviations do not \noffer much relief. Note that capacitor manufacturers’ ripple current ratings are often based on only 2000 hours of life. This makes it advisable to further derate the capacitor , or to choose a capacitor rated at a higher temperature than required. Several capacitors may be paralleled to meet size or height requirements in the design. Due to the high operating frequency of the L TC3835-1, ceramic capacitors can also be used for C\nIN. Always consult the manufacturer \nif there is any question. \nThe selection of C OUT is driven by the effective series \nresistance (ESR). Typically, once the ESR requirement is satisﬁ  ed, the capacitance is adequate for ﬁ  ltering. The \noutput ripple ( ΔV\nOUT) is approximated by:\n ΔVI E S RfCOUT RIPPLE\nOUT≈+⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1\n8\nwhere f is the operating frequency, C OUT is the output \ncapacitance and I RIPPLE  is the ripple current in the induc-\ntor . The output ripple is highest at maximum input voltage since I\nRIPPLE  increases with input voltage.\nLTC3835-1\n1438351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSetting Output Voltage\nThe L TC3835-1 output voltage is set by an external feed-\nback resistor divider carefully placed across the output, as shown in Figure 1. The regulated output voltage is determined by:\n \nVVR\nROUTB\nA=+⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟08 1.•\nTo improve the frequency response, a feed-forward ca-\npacitor , C FF , may be used. Great care should be taken to \nroute the V FB line away from noise sources, such as the \ninductor and the SW line.\nT racking and Soft-Start (TRACK/SS Pin)\nThe start-up of V OUT is controlled by the voltage on the \nTRACK/SS pin. When the voltage on the TRACK/SS pin is less than the internal 0.8V reference, the L TC3835-1 regu-lates the V\nFB pin voltage to the voltage on the TRACK/SS \npin instead of 0.8V . The TRACK/SS pin can be used to program an external soft-start function or to allow V\nOUT \nto “track” another supply during start-up.LTC3835-1\nVFBVOUT\nRB CFF\nRA\n3835-1 F01\nFigure 1. Setting Output Voltage\nSENSE+ and SENSE– Pins\nThe common mode input range of the current comparator \nis from 0V to 10V . Continuous linear operation is provided throughout this range allowing output voltages from 0.8V to 10V . The input stage of the current comparator requires that current either be sourced or sunk from the SENSE pins depending on the output voltage, as shown in the curve in Figure 2. If the output voltage is below 1.5V , current will ﬂ  ow out of both SENSE pins to the main output. In these cases, the output can be easily pre-loaded by the V\nOUT \nresistor divider to compensate for the current comparator’s negative input bias current. Since V\nFB is servoed to the \n0.8V reference voltage, R A in Figure 1 should be chosen \nto be less than 0.8V/I SENSE , with I SENSE  determined from \nFigure 2 at the speciﬁ  ed output voltage.VSENSE  COMMON MODE VOLTAGE (V)0–700INPUT CURRENT (μA)\n–600–400–300–200\n6789200\n38351 F02–500\n12345 1 0–1000100\nFigure 2.

To do this, a resistor divider should be connected from the master supply (V\nX) to the TRACK/\nSS pin of the slave supply (V OUT), as shown in Figure 5. \nDuring start-up V OUT will track V X according to the ratio \nset by the resistor divider:\n V\nVR\nRRR\nRRX\nOUTA\nTRACKATRACKA TRACKB\nAB=+\n+•\nFor coincident tracking (V OUT = V X during start-up),\n R A = R TRACKA\n R B = R TRACKBINTV CC Regulators\nThe L TC3835-1 features an internal P-channel low dropout \nlinear regulator (LDO) that supplies power at the INTV CC \npin from the V IN supply pin. INTV CC powers the gate \ndrivers and much of the L TC3835-1’s internal circuitry. The V\nIN LDO regulates the voltage at the INTV CC pin to \n5.25V . It can supply a peak current of 50mA and must be bypassed to ground with a minimum of 4.7μF tantalum, 10μF special polymer , or low ESR electrolytic capacitor . A ceramic capacitor with a minimum value of 4.7μF can also be used if a 1Ω resistor is added in series with the capacitor . No matter what type of bulk capacitor is used, an additional 1μF ceramic capacitor placed directly adjacent to the INTV\nCC and PGND IC pins is highly recommended. \nGood bypassing is needed to supply the high transient currents required by the MOSFET gate drivers and to prevent interaction between the channels.\nTIME\n(4a) Coincident TrackingVX (MASTER)\nVOUT (SLAVE)OUTPUT VOLTAGE\n3835-1 F04AVX (MASTER)\nVOUT (SLAVE)\nTIME 3835-1 F04B\n(4b) Ratiometric TrackingOUTPUT VOLTAGE\nFigure 4.

The INTV\nCC current, which is dominated \nby the gate charge current, is supplied by the 5.25V V IN \nLDO. Power dissipation for the IC in this case is equal to V\nIN • IINTVCC . The gate charge current is dependent \non operating frequency as discussed in the Efﬁ  ciency \nConsiderations section. The junction temperature can be estimated by using the equations given in Note 2 of the Electrical Characteristics. For example, the L TC3835-1 INTV\nCC current is limited to less than 25mA from a 24V \nsupply when in the GN package:\n T J = 70°C + (25mA)(24V)(90°C/W) = 125°C\nTo prevent the maximum junction temperature from being \nexceeded, the input supply current must be checked while operating in continuous conduction mode (PLLIN/MODE = INTV\nCC) at maximum V IN.\nTopside MOSFET Driver Supply (C B, DB)\nExternal bootstrap capacitors C B connected to the BOOST \npins supply the gate drive voltages for the topside MOSFET . Capacitor C\nB in the Functional Diagram is charged though \nexternal diode D B from INTV CC when the SW pin is low. When \none of the topside MOSFET is to be turned on, the driver places the C\nB voltage across the gate-source of the desired MOSFET . \nThis enhances the MOSFET and turns on the topside switch. The switch node voltage, SW , rises to V\nIN and the BOOST pin \nfollows. With the topside MOSFET on, the boost voltage is above the input supply: V\nBOOST  = V IN + V INTVCC . The value \nof the boost capacitor C B needs to be 100 times that of the \ntotal input capacitance of the topside MOSFET(s). The reverse breakdown of the external Schottky diode must be greater than V\nIN(MAX) . When adjusting the gate drive level, the ﬁ  nal \narbiter is the total input current for the regulator . If a change is made and the input current decreases, then the efﬁ  ciency \nhas improved. If there is no change in input current, then there is no change in efﬁ  ciency.Fault Conditions: Current Limit and Current Foldback \nThe L TC3835-1 includes current foldback to help limit load \ncurrent when the output is shorted to ground. If the output falls below 70% of its nominal output level, then the maxi-mum sense voltage is progressively lowered from 100mV to 30mV . Under short-circuit conditions with very low duty cycles, the L TC3835-1 will begin cycle skipping in order to limit the short-circuit current. In this situation the bottom MOSFET will be dissipating most of the power but less than in normal operation. The short-circuit ripple current is deter-mined by the minimum on-time t\nON(MIN)  of the L TC3835-1 \n(≈180ns), the input voltage and inductor value:\n ΔIL(SC) = tON(MIN)  (VIN/L)\nThe resulting short-circuit current is:\n ImV\nRISC\nSENSELS C =10 1\n2–()Δ\nFault Conditions: Overvoltage Protection (Crowbar)\nThe overvoltage crowbar is designed to blow a system input \nfuse when the output voltage of the regulator rises much higher than nominal levels. The crowbar causes huge currents to ﬂ  ow, \nthat blow the fuse to protect against a shorted top MOSFET if the short occurs while the controller is operating.\nA comparator monitors the output for overvoltage condi-\ntions. The comparator (OV) detects overvoltage faults greater than 10% above the nominal output voltage. When this condition is sensed, the top MOSFET is turned off and the bottom MOSFET is turned on until the overvoltage condition is cleared. The bottom MOSFET remains on continuously for as long as the OV condition persists; if V\nOUT returns to \na safe level, normal operation automatically resumes. A shorted top MOSFET will result in a high current condition which will open the system fuse. The switching regulator will regulate properly with a leaky top MOSFET by altering the duty cycle to accommodate the leakage.\nLTC3835-1\n1738351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPhase-Locked Loop and Frequency Synchronization\nThe L TC3835-1 has a phase-locked loop (PLL) comprised \nof an internal voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) and a phase detector . This allows the turn-on of the top MOSFET to be locked to the rising edge of an external clock signal applied to the PLLIN/MODE pin. The phase detector is an edge sensitive digital type that provides zero degrees phase shift between the external and internal oscillators. This type of phase detector does not exhibit false lock to harmonics of the external clock.The output of the phase detector is a pair of complementary \ncurrent sources that charge or discharge the external ﬁ  lter net-\nwork connected to the PLLLPF pin. The relationship between the voltage on the PLLLPF pin and operating frequency, when there is a clock signal applied to PLLIN/MODE, is shown in Figure 6 and speciﬁ  ed in the Electrical Characteristics table. \nNote that the L TC3835-1 can only be synchronized to an exter-nal clock whose frequency is within range of the L TC3835-1’s internal VCO, which is nominally 115kHz to 800kHz. This is guaranteed to be between 140kHz and 650kHz.

Phase-Locked Loop Block Diagram\nLTC3835-1\n1838351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIf the external clock frequency is greater than the internal \noscillator’s frequency, f OSC, then current is sourced con-\ntinuously from the phase detector output, pulling up the PLLLPF pin. When the external clock frequency is less than f\nOSC, current is sunk continuously, pulling down \nthe PLLLPF pin. If the external and internal frequencies are the same but exhibit a phase difference, the current sources turn on for an amount of time corresponding to the phase difference. The voltage on the PLLLPF pin is adjusted until the phase and frequency of the internal and external oscillators are identical. At the stable operating point, the phase detector output is high impedance and the ﬁ  lter capacitor C\nLP holds the voltage.\nThe loop ﬁ  lter components, C LP and R LP , smooth out the \ncurrent pulses from the phase detector and provide a stable input to the voltage-controlled oscillator . The ﬁ  lter compo-\nnents C\nLP and R LP determine how fast the loop acquires \nlock. Typically R LP = 10k and C LP is 2200pF to 0.01μF .\nTypically, the external clock (on PLLIN/MODE pin) input high \nthreshold is 1.6V , while the input low threshold is 1.2V . \nTable 1 summarizes the different states in which the \nPLLLPF pin can be used.\nTable 1\nPLLLPF PIN PLLIN/MODE PIN FREQUENCY\n0V DC Voltage 250kHzFloating DC Voltage 400kHzINTV\nCC DC Voltage 530kHz\nRC Loop Filter Clock Signal Phase-Locked to External ClockMinimum On-Time Considerations\nMinimum on-time t ON(MIN)  is the smallest time duration that \nthe L TC3835-1 is capable of turning on the top MOSFET . It is determined by internal timing delays and the gate charge required to turn on the top MOSFET . Low duty cycle applications may approach this minimum on-time limit and care should be taken to ensure that:\n \ntV\nVfON MINOUT\nIN()()<\nIf the duty cycle falls below what can be accommodated \nby the minimum on-time, the controller will begin to skip cycles. The output voltage will continue to be regulated, but the ripple voltage and current will increase. \nThe minimum on-time for the L TC3835-1 is approximately \n180ns. However , as the peak sense voltage decreases the minimum on-time gradually increases up to about 200ns. This is of particular concern in forced continuous applica-tions with low ripple current at light loads. If the duty cycle drops below the minimum on-time limit in this situation, a signiﬁ  cant amount of cycle skipping can occur with cor-\nrespondingly larger current and voltage ripple.\nLTC3835-1\n1938351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nEfﬁ  ciency Considerations\nThe percent efﬁ  ciency of a switching regulator is equal to \nthe output power divided by the input power times 100%. It is often useful to analyze individual losses to determine what is limiting the efﬁ  ciency and which change would \nproduce the most improvement. Percent efﬁ  ciency can \nbe expressed as:\n %Efﬁ  ciency = 100% – (L1 + L2 + L3 + ...)where L1, L2, etc. are the individual losses as a percent-\nage of input power .\nAlthough all dissipative elements in the circuit produce \nlosses, four main sources usually account for most of the losses in L TC3835-1 circuits: 1) IC V\nIN current, 2) INTV CC \nregulator current, 3) I2R losses, 4) Topside MOSFET \ntransition losses.\n1. The V IN current has two components: the ﬁ  rst is the \nDC supply current given in the Electrical Characteristics table, which excludes MOSFET driver and control cur-rents; the second is the current drawn from the 3.3V linear regulator output. V\nIN current typically results in \na small (<0.1%) loss.\n2. INTV CC current is the sum of the MOSFET driver and \ncontrol currents. The MOSFET driver current results from switching the gate capacitance of the power MOSFETs. Each time a MOSFET gate is switched from low to high to low again, a packet of charge dQ moves from INTV\nCC to ground. The resulting dQ/dt is a cur-\nrent out of INTV CC that is typically much larger than the \ncontrol circuit current. In continuous mode, I GATECHG   \n=  f(Q T + QB), where Q T and Q B are the gate charges of \nthe topside and bottom side MOSFETs.\n3. I2R losses are predicted from the DC resistances of the \nfuse (if used), MOSFET , inductor , current sense resis-tor , and input and output capacitor ESR. In continuous mode the average output current ﬂ  ows through L and R\nSENSE , but is “chopped” between the topside MOSFET \nand the synchronous MOSFET . If the two MOSFETs have approximately the same R\nDS(ON) , then the resistance \nof one MOSFET can simply be summed with the resis-tances of L, R\nSENSE  and ESR to obtain I2R losses. For \nexample, if each R DS(ON)  = 30mΩ, R L = 50mΩ, R SENSE  \n= 10mΩ and R ESR = 40mΩ (sum of both input and \noutput capacitance losses), then the total resistance is 130mΩ. This results in losses ranging from 3% to 13% as the output current increases from 1A to 5A for a 5V output, or a 4% to 20% loss for a 3.3V output. Efﬁ  ciency varies as the inverse square of V\nOUT for the \nsame external components and output power level. The combined effects of increasingly lower output voltages and higher currents required by high performance digital systems is not doubling but quadrupling the importance of loss terms in the switching regulator system! \n4. T ransition losses apply only to the topside MOSFET(s), \nand become signiﬁ  cant only when operating at high \ninput voltages (typically 15V or greater). T ransition losses can be estimated from:\n  T ransition Loss = (1.7) V\nIN2 IO(MAX)  CRSS f\nOther “hidden” losses such as copper trace and internal \nbattery resistances can account for an additional 5% to 10% efﬁ  ciency degradation in portable systems. It is very important to include these “system” level losses during the design phase. The internal battery and fuse resistance losses can be minimized by making sure that C\nIN has adequate charge storage and very low ESR at \nthe switching frequency. A 25W supply will typically require a minimum of 20μF to 40μF of capacitance hav-ing a maximum of 20mΩ to 50mΩ of ESR. Other losses including Schottky conduction losses during dead-time and inductor core losses generally account for less than 2% total additional loss.\nLTC3835-1\n2038351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nChecking T ransient Response\nThe regulator loop response can be checked by looking at \nthe load current transient response. Switching regulators take several cycles to respond to a step in DC (resistive) load current. When a load step occurs, V\nOUT shifts by an amount \nequal to ΔILOAD (ESR), where ESR is the effective series re-\nsistance of C OUT . ΔILOAD also begins to charge or discharge \nCOUT generating the feedback error signal that forces the \nregulator to adapt to the current change and return V OUT to \nits steady-state value. During this recovery time V OUT can be \nmonitored for excessive overshoot or ringing, which would indicate a stability problem. OPTI-LOOP compensation allows the transient response to be optimized over a wide range of output capacitance and ESR values. The availability of the \nI\nTH pin not only allows optimization of control loop behavior \nbut also provides a DC coupled and AC ﬁ  ltered closed-loop \nresponse test point. The DC step, rise time and settling at this test point truly reﬂ  ects the closed-loop response.  As-\nsuming a predominantly second order system, phase margin and/or damping factor can be estimated using the percent-age of overshoot seen at this pin. The bandwidth can also be estimated by examining the rise time at the pin. The I\nTH \nexternal components shown in Figure 10 circuit will provide an adequate starting point for most applications.\nThe I\nTH series R C-CC ﬁ  lter sets the dominant pole-zero \nloop compensation. The values can be modiﬁ  ed slightly \n(from 0.5 to 2 times their suggested values) to optimize transient response once the ﬁ  nal PC layout is done and \nthe particular output capacitor type and value have been determined. The output capacitors need to be selected because the various types and values determine the loop gain and phase. An output current pulse of 20% to 80% of full-load current having a rise time of 1μs to 10μs will \nproduce output voltage and I\nTH pin waveforms that will \ngive a sense of the overall loop stability without break-ing the feedback loop. Placing a power MOSFET directly across the output capacitor and driving the gate with an appropriate signal generator is a practical way to produce a realistic load step condition. The initial output voltage step resulting from the step change in output current may not be within the bandwidth of the feedback loop, so this signal cannot be used to determine phase margin. This is why it is better to look at the I\nTH pin signal which is in \nthe feedback loop and is the ﬁ  ltered and compensated \ncontrol loop response. The gain of the loop will be in-creased by increasing R\nC and the bandwidth of the loop \nwill be increased by decreasing C C. If R C is increased by \nthe same factor that C C is decreased, the zero frequency \nwill be kept the same, thereby keeping the phase shift the same in the most critical frequency range of the feedback loop. The output voltage settling behavior is related to the stability of the closed-loop system and will demonstrate the actual overall supply performance. \nA second, more severe transient is caused by switching in \nloads with large (>1μF) supply bypass capacitors. The dis-charged bypass capacitors are effectively put in parallel with C\nOUT , causing a rapid drop in V OUT . No regulator can alter \nits delivery of current quickly enough to prevent this sudden step change in output voltage if the load switch resistance is low and it is driven quickly. If the ratio of C\nLOAD to C OUT is \ngreater than 1:50, the switch rise time should be controlled so that the load rise time is limited to approximately 25 • C\nLOAD. Thus a 10μF capacitor would require a 250μs rise \ntime, limiting the charging current to about 200mA.\nLTC3835-1\n2138351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nDesign Example\nAs a design example, assume V IN = 12V(nominal), V IN = \n22V(max), V OUT = 1.8V , I MAX = 5A and f = 250kHz.\nThe inductance value is chosen ﬁ  rst based on a 30% ripple \ncurrent assumption. The highest value of ripple current occurs at the maximum input voltage. Tie the PLLLPF pin to GND, generating 250kHz operation. The minimum inductance for 30% ripple current is:\n \nΔIV\nfLV\nVLOUT OUT\nIN=() ( )⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟1–\nA 4.7μH inductor will produce 23% ripple current and a \n3.3μH will result in 33%. The peak inductor current will be the maximum DC value plus one half the ripple cur-rent, or 5.84A, for the 3.3μH value. Increasing the ripple current will also help ensure that the minimum on-time of 180ns is not violated. The minimum on-time occurs at maximum V\nIN:\n tV\nVfV\nVk H znON MINOUT\nIN MAX()\n().==()=18\n22 250327 s s\nThe R SENSE  resistor value can be calculated by using the \nmaximum current sense voltage speciﬁ  cation with some \naccommodation for tolerances:\n RmV\nASENSE ≤≈80\n58 40 012..Ω\nChoosing 1% resistors: R1 = 25.5k and R2 = 32.4k yields \nan output voltage of 1.816V .\nThe power dissipation on the topside MOSFET can be easily \nestimated.

These items are also illustrated graphically in the layout diagram of Figure 8. The Figure 9 illustrates the current waveforms present in the various branches of the  \nsynchronous regulator operating in the continuous mode. Check the following in your layout:\n1. Is the top N-channel MOSFET M1 located within 1cm \nof C\nIN? \n2. Are the signal and power grounds kept separate? The \ncombined IC signal ground pin and the ground return of C\nINTVCC  must return to the combined C OUT (–) ter-\nminals. The path formed by the top N-channel MOSFET , Schottky diode and the C\nIN capacitor should have short \nleads and PC trace lengths. The output capacitor (–) terminals should be connected as close as possible to the (–) terminals of the input capacitor by placing the capacitors next to each other and away from the Schottky loop described above. \n3. Does the L TC3835-1 V\nFB pin resistive divider connect to the \n(+) terminals of C OUT? The resistive divider must be con-\nnected between the (+) terminal of C OUT and signal ground. \nThe feedback resistor connections should not be along the high current input feeds from the input capacitor(s).4. Are the SENSE\n– and SENSE+ leads routed together with \nminimum PC trace spacing? The ﬁ  lter capacitor between \nSENSE+ and SENSE– should be as close as possible \nto the IC. Ensure accurate current sensing with Kelvin connections at the SENSE resistor .\n5. Is the INTV\nCC decoupling capacitor connected close to \nthe IC, between the INTV CC and the power ground pins? \nThis capacitor carries the MOSFET drivers current peaks. An additional 1μF ceramic capacitor placed immediately next to the INTV\nCC and PGND pins can help improve \nnoise performance substantially.\n6. Keep the switching node (SW), top gate node (TG), and \nboost node (BOOST) away from sensitive small-signal nodes, especially from the opposites channel’s voltage and current sensing feedback pins. All of these nodes have very large and fast moving signals and therefore should be kept on the “output side” of the L TC3835-1 and occupy minimum PC trace area.\n7. Use a modiﬁ  ed “star ground” technique: a low imped-\nance, large copper area central grounding point on the same side of the PC board as the input and output capacitors with tie-ins for the bottom of the INTV\nCC \ndecoupling capacitor , the bottom of the voltage feedback resistive divider and the SGND pin of the IC.\nCB\nDB\nCINTVCC\n+CIND1\nOPTIONAL\n1μF\nCERAMICM1 M2+CVIN\nVINRINTRACK/SS\nSENSE+\nSENSE–\nVFB\nPLLLPFPLLIN/MODERUNI\nTH\nSGNDTG\nSW\nBOOST\nVIN\nBG\nINTV CC\nPGNDLTC3835EGN-1L1\nCOUTVOUT\nGND+RSENSE\nfIN\n3835-1 F08\nFigure 8. L TC3835-1 Recommended Printed Circuit Layout Diagram\nLTC3835-1\n2338351fc APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPC Board Layout Debugging\nIt is helpful to use a DC-50MHz current probe to monitor \nthe current in the inductor while testing the circuit. Monitor the output switching node (SW pin) to synchronize the oscilloscope to the internal oscillator and probe the actual output voltage as well. Check for proper performance over the operating voltage and current range expected in the application. The frequency of operation should be main-tained over the input voltage range down to dropout and until the output load drops below the low current opera-tion threshold—typically 10% of the maximum designed current level in Burst Mode operation.\nThe duty cycle percentage should be maintained from cycle \nto cycle in a well-designed, low noise PCB implementation. Variation in the duty cycle at a subharmonic rate can sug-gest noise pickup at the current or voltage sensing inputs or inadequate loop compensation. Overcompensation of the loop can be used to tame a poor PC layout if regulator bandwidth optimization is not required. \nReduce V\nIN from its nominal level to verify operation \nof the regulator in dropout. Check the operation of the undervoltage lockout circuit by further lowering V\nIN while \nmonitoring the outputs to verify operation.RL1 D1L1SW RSENSE VOUT\nCOUTVIN\nCINRIN\nBOLD LINES INDICATE HIGH SWITCHING \nCURRENT . KEEP LINES TO A MINIMUM LENGTH.3835-1 F09\nFigure 9. Branch Current Waveforms\nInvestigate whether any problems exist only at higher output \ncurrents or only at higher input voltages. If problems coincide with high input voltages and low output currents, look for capacitive coupling between the BOOST , SW , TG, and pos-sibly BG connections and the sensitive voltage and current pins. The capacitor placed across the current sensing pins needs to be placed immediately adjacent to the pins of the IC. This capacitor helps to minimize the effects of differential noise injection due to high frequency capacitive coupling. If problems are encountered with high current output loading at lower input voltages, look for inductive coupling between C\nIN, Schottky and the top MOSFET components to the \nsensitive current and voltage sensing traces. In addition, investigate common ground path voltage pickup between these components and the SGND pin of the IC.\nAn embarrassing problem, which can be missed in an \notherwise properly working switching regulator , results when the current sensing leads are hooked up backwards. The output voltage under this improper hookup will still be maintained but the advantages of current mode control  will not be realized. Compensation of the voltage loop will be much more sensitive to component selection. This behavior can be investigated by temporarily shorting out the current sensing resistor—don’t worry, the regulator will still maintain control of the output voltage.\nLTC3835-1\n2438351fcTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nHigh Efﬁ  ciency 9.5V , 3A Step-Down Converter\nVOUT\n9.5V\n3A\nCOUT\n150μF0.01μFVIN\n4V TO 36V\nITH\nSGND\nPLLIN/MODE\nVFB\nSENSE+SENSE–PLLLPF\nRUNTRACK/SS\nINTV\nCC\nBG\nPGNDL TC3835-17.2μH 0.012Ω\n39.2k\n38351 TA02100pFM1\nM2560pF\n35k\n432k4.7μFCB\n0.22μFTGVIN\nBOOST\nSWCIN\n10μF\nHigh Efﬁ  ciency 12V to 1.8V , 2A Step-Down Converter\nVOUT\n1.8V\n2A\nCOUT\n100μF\nCERAMIC0.01μFVIN\n12V\nITH\nSGND\nPLLIN/MODE\nVFB\nSENSE+SENSE–PLLLPF\nRUNTRACK/SS\nINTV\nCC\nBG\nPGNDL TC3835-13.3μH 0.020Ω\n20k\n38351 TA03100pFM1\nM2330pF\nM1, M2: Si4840DY\nL1 TOKO 053LC A915AY-3R3M33k\n62.5k4.7μFCB\n0.22μFTGVIN\nBOOST\nSWCIN\n10μF\nLTC3835-1\n2538351fcTYPICAL APPLICATIONS\nHigh Efﬁ  ciency 5V , 5A Step-Down Converter\nHigh Efﬁ  ciency 1.2V , 5A Step-Down ConverterVOUT\n5V\n5A\nCOUT\n150μF0.01μFVIN\n4V TO\n36V\nITH\nSGND\nPLLIN/MODE\nVFB\nSENSE+SENSE–PLLLPF\nRUNTRACK/SS\nINTV\nCC\nBG\nPGNDL TC3835-13.3μH 0.012Ω\n69.8k\n38351 TA04100pFM1\nM2470pF\n10k\n365k4.7μFCB\n0.22μFTGVIN\nBOOST\nSWCIN\n10μF\nVOUT\n1.2V\n5A\nCOUT\n150μF0.01μFGNDVIN\n4V TO\n36V\nITH\nSGND\nPLLIN/MODE\nVFB\nSENSE+SENSE–PLLLPF\nRUNTRACK/SS\nINTV\nCC\nBG\nPGNDL TC3835-12.2μH 0.012Ω\n118k\n38351 TA05100pFM1\nM22.2nF\n10k\n59.5k4.7μFCB\n0.22μFTGVIN\nBOOST\nSWCIN\n10μF\nLTC3835-1\n2638351fc PACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nDHC Package\n16-Lead Plastic DFN (5mm × 3mm)\n(Reference L TC DWG # 05-08-1706)\n3.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)5.00 ±0.10\n(2 SIDES)\nNOTE:\n1.
