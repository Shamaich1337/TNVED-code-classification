It can deliver up to 5A DC output current with few external input and output capacitors. This module provides precisely regulated output voltage adjustable between 0.6V to 5.5V via one external resistor over a 4V to 20V input voltage range. With an external bias supply above 4V connected to SV\nIN, this module operates with \nan input voltage down to 2.375V. The typical application schematic is shown in Figure 20.\nThe LTM4625 contains an integrated constant on-time \nvalley current mode regulator, power MOSFETs, inductor, and other supporting discrete components. The default switching frequency is 1 MHz.  For switching noise-sensitive \napplications, the switching frequency can be adjusted by external resistors and the μModule regulator can be externally synchronized to a clock within ±30% of the set frequency. See the Applications Information section.\nWith current mode control and internal feedback loop \ncompensation, the LTM4625 module has sufficient stabil -\nity margins and good transient performance with a wide range \nof output capacitors, even with all ceramic output \ncapacitors.\nCurrent mode control provides cycle-by-cycle fast cur -\nrent limiting. Foldback current limiting is provided in an \nover\ncurrent condition indicated by a drop in V FB reducing \ninductor valley current to approximately 40% of the origi -\nnal value. Internal output overvoltage and undervoltage comparators pull the open-drain PGOOD output low if the output \nfeedback voltage exits a ±10% window around the regulation point.  Continuous operation is forced during OV \nand UV condition except during start-up when the TRACK pin is ramping up to 0.6V.\nFurthermore,  in order to protect the internal power MOSFET \ndevices against transient voltage spikes, the LTM4625 \nconstantly monitors the V\nIN pin for an overvoltage condi -\ntion. When V IN rises above 23.5V, the regulator suspends \noperation by shutting off both power MOSFETs. Once V IN \ndrops below 21.5V, the regulator immediately resumes normal operation. The regulator does not execute its soft-start function when exiting an overvoltage condition.\nMultiphase operation can be easily employed with the \nsynchronization and phase mode controls.  Up to 12 phases \ncan be cascaded to run simultaneously with respect to each other by programming the PHMODE pin to different levels. The LTM4625 has CLKIN and CLKOUT pins for PolyPhase operation of multiple devices or frequency synchronization. \nPulling the RUN pin below 1.1V forces the controller into \nits shutdown state, turning off both power MOSFETs and most of the internal control circuitry. At light load currents, discontinuous mode (DCM) operation can be enabled to achieve higher efficiency compared to continu -\nous mode (CCM) by pulling the MODE pin to SGND. The  \nTRACK/SS pin is used for power supply tracking and soft-start programming\n. See the Applications Informa -\ntion section.\nLTM4625\n9\nRev D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe typical LTM4625 application circuit is shown in \nFigure 20. External component selection is primarily determined by the input voltage,  the output voltage \nand the maximum load current.  Refer to Table\xa07  for \nspecific external capacitor requirements for a particular application.\nV\nIN to V OUT Step-Down Ratios\nThere are restrictions in the maximum V IN and V OUT step-\ndown ratios that can be achieved for a given input voltage \ndue to the minimum off-time and minimum on-time limits of the regulator\n. The minimum off-time limit imposes a \nmaximum duty cycle which can be calculated as: \n  DMAX = 1 – (t OFF(MIN)  • fSW)\nwhere t OFF(MIN)  is the minimum off-time, typically 70ns \nfor LTM4625, and f SW (Hz) is the switching frequency. \nConversely the minimum on-time limit imposes a minimum duty cycle of the converter which can be calculated as:\n DMIN = tON(MIN)  • fSW\nwhere t ON(MIN)  is the minimum on-time, typically 40ns \nfor LTM4625. In the rare cases where the minimum duty cycle is surpassed, the output voltage will still remain in regulation, but the switching frequency will decrease from its programmed value. Note that additional thermal derating may be applied. See the Thermal Considerations and Output Current Derating section in this data sheet.\nOutput Voltage Programming\nThe PWM controller has an internal 0.6V reference voltage. \nAs shown in the Block Diagram, a 60.4k internal feedback \nresistor connects the V\nOUT and FB pins together. Adding a \nresistor, R FB, from FB pin to SGND programs the output \nvoltage:\n  RFB=0.6V\nVOUT– 0.6V• 60.4k\nTable\xa01.

Tie the V OUT, the COMP and FB \npins together for each paralleled output. Connect a single resistor from FB to GND as determined by:\n  RFB=0.6V\nVOUT– 0.6V•60.4k\nN \nSee Figure 23 for an example of parallel operation.\nInput Decoupling Capacitors\nThe LTM\n4625 module should be connected to a low AC \nimpedance DC source. For the regulator, a 10µF input \nceramic capacitor is required for RMS ripple current de -\ncoupling. Bulk input capacitance is only needed when the input sour\nce impedance is compromised by long inductive \nleads, traces or not enough source capacitance. The bulk capacitor can be an aluminum electrolytic capacitor or polymer capacitor.\nWithout considering the inductor ripple current, the RMS \ncurrent of the input capacitor can be estimated as:\n  ICIN(RMS) =IOUT(MAX)\nη%• D • 1– D ( )\nwhere η% is the estimated efficiency of the power module.\nOutput Decoupling Capacitors\nWith an optimized high frequency, high bandwidth design, \nonly a single low ESR output ceramic capacitor is required for the LTM4625 to achieve low output ripple voltage and very good transient response. In extreme cold or hot tem -\nperature or high output voltage case, additional ceramic capacitor or tantalum-polymer capacitor is required due to variation of actual capacitance over bias voltage and temperature\n. Table\xa07  shows a matrix of different output \nvoltages and output capacitors to minimize the voltage droop and overshoot during a 1A or 2A load-step tran -\nsient. Additional output filtering may be required by the system designer if further reduction of output ripple or dynamic\n\xa0transient spikes is required. The Analog Devices \nL TpowerCAD® design tool is available to download online \nfor output ripple, stability and transient response analysis for further optimization.\nLTM4625\n10\nRev D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nDiscontinuous Current Mode (DCM)\nIn applications where low output ripple and high efficiency \nat intermediate current are desired, discontinuous current mode (DCM) should be used by connecting the MODE pin to SGND. At light loads the internal current comparator may remain tripped for several cycles and force the top MOSFET to stay off for several cycles,  thus skipping cycles. \nThe inductor current does not reverse in this mode. \nForced Continuous Current Mode (CCM)\nIn applications where fixed frequency operation is more \ncritical than low current efficiency, and where the lowest output ripple is desired,  forced continuous operation should \nbe used. Forced continuous operation can be enabled by tying the MODE pin to INTV\nCC. In this mode,  inductor current \nis allowed to reverse during low output loads, the COMP voltage is in control of the current comparator threshold throughout,  and the top MOSFET always turns on with each \noscillator pulse. During start-up, forced continuous mode is disabled and inductor current is prevented from revers -\ning until the LTM4625’s output voltage is in regulation. \nOperating Frequency\nThe operating frequency of the \nLTM4625 is optimized to \nachieve the compact package size and the minimum out-\nput ripple voltage while still keeping high efficiency. The default operating frequency is 1MHz. In most applications, no additional frequency adjustment is required.\nIf an operating frequency other than 1MHz is required by \nthe application, the operating frequency can be increased \nby adding a resistor, R\nFSET, between the FREQ pin and \nSGND, as shown in Figure 22. The operating frequency can be calculated as:\n  f Hz()=1.6e11\n162k ||RFSET Ω()\nThe operating frequency can also be decreased by adding a resistor between the FREQ pin and INTV\nCC, calculated as:\n  f Hz()= 1 MHz –2.8e11\nRFSET Ω()The programmable operating frequency range is from 800kHz to 4MHz.\nFrequency Synchronization and Clock In\nThe power module has a phase-locked loop comprised \nof an internal voltage controlled oscillator and a phase detector. This allows the internal top MOSFET turn-on to be locked to the rising edge of the external clock. The external clock frequency range must be within ±30% around the resistor set operating frequency. A pulse detection circuit is used to detect a clock on the CLKIN pin to turn on the phase-locked loop. The pulse width of the clock has to be at least 100ns. The clock high level must be above 2V and clock low level below 0.3V. During the start-up of the regulator, the phase-locked loop function is disabled.\nMultiphase Operation\nFor output loads that demand more than 5A of current, \nmultiple LTM4625s can be paralleled to run out of phase \nto provide more output current without increasing input and output voltage ripples.\nThe CLKOUT signal can be connected to the CLKIN pin of \nthe following LTM4625 stage to line up both the frequency and the phase of the entire system. Tying the PHMODE pin to INTV\nCC, SGND or INTV CC/2 generates a phase differ -\nence ( between CLKIN and CLKOUT) of 180°, 120°, or 90° \nrespectively, which corresponds to 2-phase, 3-phase or 4-phase operation. A total of 12 phases can be cascaded to run simultaneously out of phase with respect to each other by programming the PHMODE pin of each LTM4625 to different levels. Figure 2 shows a 4-phase design and a 6-phase design example for clock phasing.\nTable\xa02.

The output ripple amplitude is also reduced by the number of phases used when all of the outputs are tied together  to achieve a single high output current design.\nThe LTM4625 device is an inherently current mode con -\ntrolled device, so parallel modules will have very good \ncurrent \nsharing. This will balance the thermals on the \ndesign. Please tie the RUN, TRACK/SS, FB and COMP pins of each paralleling channel together.

A capacitor on the TRACK/SS pin will program the ramp rate of the output voltage. An internal 2µA current source will charge up the external soft-start capacitor towards INTV\nCC voltage. When the TRACK/SS voltage is below \n0.6V, it will take over the internal 0.6V reference voltage to control the output voltage. The total soft-start time can be calculated as:\n  tSS= 0.6 •CSS\n2µA\nwhere C SS is the capacitance on the TRACK/SS pin. Cur-\nrent foldback and forced continuous mode are disabled during the soft-start process.Output voltage tracking can also be programmed externally using the TRACK/SS pin. The output can be tracked up and down with another regulator. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show an example waveform and schematic of ratiometric tracking where the slave regulator’s output slew rate is proportional to the master’s.\nSince the slave regulator’s TRACK/SS is connected to \nthe master’s output through a R\nTR(TOP) /RTR(BOT)  resistor \ndivider and its voltage used to regulate the slave output voltage when TRACK/SS voltage is below 0.6V, the slave output voltage and the master output voltage should satisfy the following equation during start-up:\n  VOUT(SL) •RFB(SL)\nRFB(SL) + 60.4k=\nVOUT(MA) •RTR(BOT)\nRTR(TOP) +RTR(BOT)\nFigure 4.

From the equation, we could solve that R\nTR(TOP) = 60.4k and R TR(BOT)  = 40.2k are a good \ncombination for the ratiometric tracking.\nThe TRACK/SS pin will have the 2µA current source on \nwhen a resistive divider is used to implement tracking on the slave regulator. This will impose an offset on the  \nTRACK/ S\nS pin input.  Smaller value resistors with the same \nratios as the resistor values calculated from the above equation can be used. For example, where the 60.4k is \nused then a 6.04k can be used to reduce the TRACK/SS pin offset to a negligible value.\nCoincident output tracking can be recognized as a special \nratiometric output tracking in which the master’s output slew rate (MR) is the same as the slave’s output slew rate (SR), waveform as shown in Figure 6.\nFrom the equation, we could easily find that, in coincident \ntracking,  the slave regulator’ s TRACK/ SS pin resistor divider \nis always the same as its feedback divider:\n  RFB(SL)\nRFB(SL) + 60.4k=RTR(BOT)\nRTR(TOP) +RTR(BOT)\nFor example, R TR(TOP)  = 60.4k and R TR(BOT)  = 60.4k is a \ngood combination for coincident tracking for a V OUT(MA) \n= 1.5V and V OUT(SL)  = 1.2V application.Figure 6. Output Coincident T racking Waveform\nPower Good\nThe PGOOD pin is an open-drain pin that can be used to \nmonitor valid output voltage regulation. This pin is pulled low when the output voltage exceeds a ±10% window around the regulation point. To prevent unwanted PGOOD glitches during transients or dynamic V\nOUT changes, the \nLTM4625’s PGOOD falling edge includes a blanking delay of approximately 52 switching cycles.\nStability Compensation\nThe LTM4625’ s internal compensation loop is designed and \noptimized for use with low ESR ceramic output capacitors. \nTable\xa07  is provided for most application requirements. In \ncase a bulk output capacitor is required for output ripple or dynamic transient spike reduction, an additional 10pF to 15pF feedforward capacitor (C\nFF) is needed between \nthe V OUT and FB pins. The L TpowerCAD design tool is \navailable for control loop optimization.\nRUN Enable\nPulling the RUN pin to ground forces the LTM4625 into \nits shutdown state, turning off both power MOSFETs and most of its internal control circuitry. Bringing the RUN pin above 0.7V turns on the internal reference only, while still keeping the power MOSFETs off. Increasing the RUN pin voltage above 1.2V will turn on the entire chip.TIMEMASTER OUTPUT\nSLAVE OUTPUTOUTPUT VOL TAGE\n4625 F06\nLTM4625\n14\nRev D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nPre-Biased Output Start-Up\nThere may be situations that require the power supply to \nstart up with some charge on the output capacitors. The LTM4625 can safely power up into a pre-biased output without discharging it.\nThe LTM4625 accomplishes this by forcing discontinuous \nmode (DCM) operation until the TRACK/SS pin voltage reaches 0.6V reference voltage. This will prevent the BG from turning on during the pre-biased output start-up which would discharge the output.\nDo not pre-bias LTM4625 with an output voltage higher \nthan INTV\nCC (3.3V) or a voltage higher than the output \nvoltage set by feedback resistor (R FB).\nOvertemperature Protection\nThe internal overtemperature protection monitors the junc -\ntion temperature of the module . If the junction temperature \nreaches approximately 160°C, both power switches will be \nturned off until the temperature drops about 15°C cooler.\nLow Input Application\nThe LTM4625 module has a separate SV IN pin which \nmakes it suitable for low input voltage applications down \nto 2.375V. The SV IN pin is the single input of the whole \ncontrol circuitry while the V IN pin is the power input which \ndirectly connects to the drain of the top MOSFET. In most applications where V\nIN is greater than 4V, connect SV IN \ndirectly to V IN with a short trace. An optional filter, con -\nsisting of a resistor (1Ω to 10Ω) between SV IN and V IN \nalong with a 0.1µF bypass capacitor between SV IN and \nground, can be placed for additional noise immunity. This filter is not necessary in most cases if good PCB layout practices are followed (see Figure 19). In a low input voltage (2.375V to 4V) application, or to reduce power dissipation by the internal bias LDO, connect SV\nIN to an \nexternal voltage higher than 4V with a 1µF local bypass capacitor. Figure 21 shows an example of a low input voltage application. Please note the SV\nIN voltage cannot \ngo below the V OUT voltage.Thermal Considerations and Output Current Derating\nThe thermal resistances reported in the Pin Configuration \nsection of the data sheet are consistent with those param -\neters defined by JESD 51-12 and are intended for use with finite element analysis \n(FEA) software modeling tools that \nleverage the outcome of thermal modeling, simulation, and correlation to hardware evaluation performed on a µModule package mounted to a hardware test board. The motivation for providing these thermal coefficients is found in JESD 51-12 (Guidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information).\nMany designers may opt to use laboratory equipment \nand a test vehicle such as the demo board to anticipate the µModule regulator’s thermal performance in their ap -\nplication at various electrical and environmental operating conditions to compliment any FEA activities\n. Without FEA \nsoftware, the thermal resistances reported in the Pin Con -\nfiguration section are, in and of themselves, not relevant to providing guidance of thermal per\nformance; instead, the \nderating curves provided in this data sheet can be used in a manner that yields insight and guidance pertaining to one’s application usage, and can be adapted to correlate thermal performance to one’s own application.\nThe Pin Configuration section gives four thermal coeffi -\ncients explicitly defined in JESD 51-12; these coefficients \nare quoted or paraphrased below\n:\n1.\n θJA, the thermal resistance from junction to ambient, is \nthe natural convection junction-to-ambient air thermal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclo -\nsure. This environment is sometimes referred to as “\nstill air” although natural convection causes the air to \nmove. This value is determined with the part mounted to a 95mm × 76mm PCB with four layers.\n2.\n θJCbottom , the thermal resistance from junction to the \nbottom of the product case, is determined with all of the component power dissipation flowing through the bottom of the package. In the typical µ Module regulator, \nthe bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the pack -\nage, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient environment\n. As a result, this thermal resistance value \nLTM4625\n15\nRev D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nmay be useful for comparing packages, but the test \nconditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n3.\n θJCtop, the thermal resistance from junction to top of \nthe product case, is determined with nearly all of the component power dissipation flowing through the top of the package. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule regulator are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for an application to operate such that most of the heat flows from the junction to the top of the part. As in the case of \nθJCbottom , this value may be useful \nfor comparing packages but the test conditions don’t generally match the user’s application.\n4.\n θJB, the thermal resistance from junction to the printed \ncircuit board,  is the junction-to-board thermal resistance \nwhere almost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the µModule package and into the board, and is really the sum of the \nθJCbottom  and the thermal resistance of \nthe bottom of the part through the solder joints and through a portion of the board. The board temperature is measured a specified distance from the package.\nA graphical representation of the aforementioned ther -\nmal resistances is given in Figure 7; blue resistances are contained within the \nμModule regulator, whereas green \nresistances are external to the µModule package.As a practical matter, it should be clear to the reader that no individual or sub-group of the four thermal resistance parameters defined by JESD 51-12 or provided in the Pin Configuration section replicates or conveys normal operating conditions of a μModule regulator. For example, in normal board-mounted applications, never does 100% of the device’s total power loss (heat) thermally conduct exclusively through the top or exclusively through bot -\ntom of the µModule package—as the standard defines for \nθJCtop and θJCbottom , respectively. In practice, power \nloss is thermally dissipated in both directions away from the package—granted, in the absence of a heat sink and airflow, a majority of the heat flow is into the board.\nWithin the LTM4625 be aware there are multiple power \ndevices and components dissipating power, with a con -\nsequence that the thermal resistances relative to different junctions of components or die are not exactly linear with respect to total package power loss\n. To reconcile this \ncomplication without sacrificing modeling simplicity— but \nalso, not ignoring practical realities— an approach has been \ntaken using FEA software modeling along with laboratory testing in a controlled environment chamber to reason -\nably define and correlate the thermal resistance values supplied in this data sheet\n: (1) Initially, FEA software is \nused to accurately build the mechanical geometry of the \nFigure 7.

An outcome of this process and due diligence yields the set of derating curves shown in this data sheet. After these laboratory tests have been performed and correlated to the LTM4625 model, then the \nθJB and θBA are summed \ntogether to provide a value that should closely equal the \nθJA value because approximately 100% of power loss \nflows from the junction through the board into ambient with no airflow or top mounted heat sink.\nThe 1.0V, 1.5V, 3.3V and 5 V power loss curves in Figure 8 to \nFigure 11 can be used in coordination with the load current \nderating curves in Figure 12 to Figure 18 for calculating an approximate \nθJA thermal resistance for the LTM4625 \nwith various airflow conditions. The power loss curves are taken at room temperature, and are increased with a multiplicative factor according to the ambient tempera -\nture. This approximate factor is: 1.4\n  for 120°C at junction \ntemperature. Maximum load current is achievable while increasing ambient temperature as long as the junction temperature is less than 120°C, which is a 5°C guard band from maximum junction temperature of 125°C. When the \nambient temperature reaches a point where the junction temperature is 120°C, then the load current is lowered to maintain the junction at 120°C while increasing ambient temperature up to 120°C. The derating curves are plotted with the output current starting at 5A and the ambient tem -\nperature at 30°C. The output voltages are 1.0V, 1.5\n V, 3.3V and 5V. These are chosen to include the lower and higher output voltage ranges for correlating the thermal resistance. Thermal models are derived from several temperature measurements in a controlled temperature chamber along with thermal modeling analysis.  The junction temperatures \nare monitored while ambient temperature is increased with and without airflow. The power loss increase with ambient temperature change is factored into the derating curves. The junctions are maintained at 120°C maximum while lowering output current or power with increasing ambient temperature. The decreased output current will decrease the internal module loss as ambient temperature is increased . The monitored junction temperature of 120°C \nminus the ambient operating temperature specifies how much module temperature rise can be allowed. As an example, in Figure 13 the load current is derated to ~3A at \n~95°C with no air flow or heat sink and the power loss for the 12V to 1.0V at 3A output is about 1.15W. The 1.15W loss is calculated with the ~0.82W room temperature loss from the 12V to 1.0V power loss curve at 3A, and the 1.4 multiplying factor at 120°C junction temperature. If the \n95°C ambient temperature is subtracted from the 120°C junction temperature, then the difference of 25°C divided by 1.15W equals a 22°C/W \nθJA thermal resistance. Table\xa03   \nspecifies a 22°C/ W value which is ver y close.  Table\xa04 ,  Table\xa05   \nand Table\xa06  provide equivalent thermal resistances for \n1.5\nV 3.3V and 5V outputs with and without airflow and \nheat sinking. The derived thermal resistances in Table\xa03, Table\xa04,  Table\xa05  and Table\xa06  for the various conditions can \nbe multiplied by the calculated power loss as a function of ambient temperature to derive temperature rise above ambient, thus maximum junction temperature. Room temperature power loss can be derived from the efficiency curves in the Typical Performance Characteristics section and adjusted with the above ambient temperature multipli -\ncative factors. The printed circuit board is a 1.6mm thick 4\n-layer board with two ounce copper for the two outer \nlayers and one ounce copper for the two inner layers.

Recommended PCB LayoutSafety Considerations\nThe LTM4625 modules do not provide galvanic isolation \nfrom V IN to V OUT. There is no internal fuse. If required, \na slow blow fuse with a rating twice the maximum input current needs to be provided to protect each unit from catastrophic failure. The device does support thermal shutdown and over current protection. \nLayout Checklist/Example\nThe high integration of LTM4625 makes the PCB board \nlayout very simple and easy. However, to optimize its electrical and thermal performance, some layout consid -\nerations are still necessary.\n•\n \n Use large PCB copper areas for high current paths\n, \nincluding V IN, GND and V OUT. It helps to minimize the \nPCB conduction loss and thermal stress.\n• \n Place high frequency ceramic input and output capaci -\ntors next to the V IN, PGND and V OUT pins to minimize \nhigh frequency noise.• \n Place a dedicated power ground layer underneath the \nunit\n.\n• \n T\no minimize the via conduction loss and reduce module \nthermal stress, use multiple vias for interconnection between top layer and other power layers.\n• \n Do not put via directly on the pad\n, unless they are \ncapped or plated over.\n• \n Use a separated SGND ground copper area for com -\nponents connected to signal pins. Connect the SGND to GND underneath the unit\n.\n• \n Bring out test points on the signal pins for monitoring\n.\n• \n Keep s\neparation between CLKIN,  CLKOUT and FREQ pin \ntraces to minimize possibility of noise due to crosstalk between these signals. \nFigure 19 gives a good example of the recommended layout.\nVIN\nCOUT GNDVOUTRFB\n4625 F19GND\nCIN\nLTM4625\n21\nRev D For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure 20.  4V IN to 20V IN, 1.5V Output at 5A Design Figure 21. 2.375V IN to 5V IN, 1V at 5A Output Design\nFigure 22.  4V IN to 20V IN, Tw o  Phases, 1.5V at 10A DesignVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN FREQ CLKOUT\nV\nOUT10µF\n25V47µF6.3VV\nIN\n4V TO 20VVOUT\n1.5V5A\nFB\nCOMP\nGND40.2kSGND\n4625 F200.1µFVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN\nCLKOUT FREQ\n5VVOUT10µF\n25V1µF6.3V47µF6.3VV\nIN\n2.375V TO 5VVOUT\n1V5A\nFB\nCOMP\nGND90.9k\nSGND\n4624 F210.1µF\nVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN2MHz\nCLOCK162k\nCLKOUT FREQ\nVOUT10µF\n25V47µF6.3VV\nIN\n4V TO 20VVOUT\n3.3V5A\nFB\nCOMP\nGND13.3k\nSGND\n4624 F220.1µFVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN\nV\nOUT10µF\n25V×2\n47µF6.3V×2\n20.1kV\nIN\n4V TO 20VVOUT\n1.5V10A\nFB\nCOMP\nGND\n4625 F23SGNDCLKOUT FREQ\n0.1µF\nVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN CLKOUT FREQ\nV\nOUT\nFB\nCOMP\nGND SGND\nFigure 23. 4V IN to 20V IN, 3.3V Output with 2MHz External Clock\nLTM4625\n22\nRev D For more information www.analog.comFigure 24. 4V IN to 20V IN, 1.2V and 1.5V with Coincident T rackingAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN\nV\nOUT10µF\n25V×247µF6.3V\n47µF6.3V\n60.4kV\nIN\n4V TO 20VVOUT\n1.5V5A\nV\nOUT2\n1.2V\n5AFB\n40.2k COMP\nGND\n60.4k60.4k\n4625 F24SGNDFREQ CLKOUT\n0.1µF\nVIN\nSVIN\nRUN\nINTV CC\nMODEPHMODETRACK/SSPGOODL TM4625CLKIN\nV\nOUT\nFB\nCOMP\nGND SGNDFREQ CLKOUT\nLTM4625\n23\nRev D For more information www.analog.comPACKAGE DESCRIPTION\nLTM4625 Component BGA PinoutPACKAGE ROW AND COLUMN LABELING MAY VARY \nAMONG µModule PRODUCTS.
