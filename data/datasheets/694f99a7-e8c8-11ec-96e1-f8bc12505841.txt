Precautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General Storage\n•Avoid storage locations where devices may be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight.\n•Follow the precautions printed on the packing label of the device for transportation and storage.\n•Keep the storage location temperature and humidity within a range of 5 \ue00c to 35 \ue00c and 45 % to 75 %,\nrespectively.\n•Do not store the products in locations with poisonous gases (especially corrosive gases) or in dusty\nconditions.\n•Store the products in locations with minimal temperature fluctuations. Rapid temperature changes during\nstorage can cause condensation, resulting in lead oxidation or corrosion, which will deteriorate the\nsolderability of the leads.\n•When restoring devices after removal from their packing, use anti-static containers.\n•Do not allow loads to be applied directly to devices while they are in storage.\n•If devices have been stored for more than two years under normal storage conditions, it is recommended\nthat you check the leads for ease of soldering prior to use.2019-07-08\nRev.2.0©2016-2019\nToshiba Electronic Devices & Storage Corporation \nTLP291(SE\n913. 13. 13. 13.
