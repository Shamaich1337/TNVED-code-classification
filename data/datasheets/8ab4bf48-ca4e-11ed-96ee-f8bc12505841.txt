Antenna with gain up to 4 0dB and noise figure less than 2dB can be used.  It is \nimportant t o select a high -performance antenna to achieve optimal RTK performance.  \n \n \nPOWER SUPPLY REQUIREMENT  \n \nPX1172RH  requ ires a stable power supply, avoid ripple on VCC pin (<50mVpp). Power supply noise can affect the \nreceiver’s sensitivity. Bypass capacitors sho uld be placed close to the module VCC pin, with values adjusted depending \non the amount and type of noise present on the supply line.  \n \n \n \nBACKUP SUPPLY  \n \nThe purpose of backup supply voltage pin (V _BCKP ) is to keep the SRAM memory and the RTC powered when t he \nmodule is powered down. This enables the module to have a faster time -to-first-fix when the module is powered o n \nagain. The backup current dr ain is less than  55μA. In normal powered on state, the internal processor access the SRAM \nand current drain is higher in active mode  \n \n \n \n1PPS OUTPUT  \n \nA 1 pulse per second signal ( 100msec  HIGH duration) is generated on 1PPS pin when the receiver has 3D position fix \nusing 4 or  more satellites. The rising edge of the pulse is aligned with UTC second, with accuracy of about 10nsec. It \noutputs constant LOW when no position fix is available  initially .  \n \n \n \nLAYOUT GUIDELINES  \n \nSeparate RF and digital circuits into different PCB regio ns.  \n \nIt is necessary to maintain 50 -ohm impedance throughout the entire RF signal path. Try keeping the RF signal path as \nshort as possible.  \n \nDo not route the RF signal line near noisy sources such as digital signals, oscillators, switching power supplie s, or other \nRF transmitting circuit. Do not route the RF signal under or over any other components (including PX1172RH ), or other \nsignal traces. Do not route the RF signal path on an inner layer of a multi -layer PCB to minimize signal loss.  \n \nAvoid sharp be nds for RF signal path. Make two 45 -deg bends or a circular bend instead of a single 90 -degree bend if \nneeded.  \n \nAvoid vias with RF signal path whenever possible. Every via adds inductive impedance. Vias are acceptable for \nconnecting the RF grounds between different layers. Each of the module’s ground pins should have short trace tying \nimmediately to the ground plane below through a via.  \n \nThe bypass capacitors should be low ESR ceramic types and located directly adjacent to the pin they are for.  \n \n \n \n \n \n13 \nwww.skytraq.com.tw  HANDLIN G GUIDELINE  \n \nThe PX1172RH  modules are rated MSL4, must be used for SMT reflow mounting within 72 hours after taken out from \nthe vacuumed ESD -protective moisture barrier bag in factory condition < 30degC / 60% RH. If this floor life time is \nexceeded, or if the received ESD -protective moisture barrier bag is not in vacuumed state, then the device need to be \npre-baked before SMT reflow process. Baking is to be done at 85degC for 8 to 12 hours. Once baked, floor life counting \nbegins from 0, and has 72 hours of floor life at factory condition < 30degC / 60% RH.  \n \nPX1172RH  module is ESD sensitive device and should be handled with care.  \n \n \n \nRTK Usage Guideline   \n \nBelow conditions are required for getting RTK fix solution. If the condition s are not met, PX1172RH  will o nly have float \nor DGPS/3D solution and behav e like a normal G NSS receiver.  \n \n* Base and rover distance under 30Km  \n* Open sky environment without interference  \n* Signal over 3 7dB/Hz  \n* 8 or more satellites above 15 degree elevation angle with good satellite g eometry or low DOP value; generally more \nsatellites will have faster RTK fix  \n14 \nwww.skytraq.com.tw  NMEA Output Description  \n \nThe output protocol supports NMEA -0183 standard.
