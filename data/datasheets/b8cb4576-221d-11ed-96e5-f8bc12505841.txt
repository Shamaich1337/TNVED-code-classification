Both devices deliver ±1.5A output currentand control the TEC current to eliminate harmful currentsurges. On-chip FETs minimize external componentsand high switching frequency reduces the size of exter-nal components.\nThe MAX8520/MAX8521 operate from a single supply and\nbias the TEC between the outputs of two synchronousbuck regulators. This operation allows for temperaturecontrol without “dead zones” or other nonlinearities atlow current. This arrangement ensures that the controlsystem does not hunt when the set-point is very closeto the natural operating point, requiring a small amountof heating or cooling. An analog control signal preciselysets the TEC current.\nBoth devices feature accurate, individually-adjustable\nheating current limit and cooling current limit along withmaximum TEC voltage limit to improve the reliability ofoptical modules. An analog output signal monitors theTEC current. A unique ripple cancellation scheme helpsreduce noise.\nThe MAX8520 is available in a 5mm x 5mm TQFN pack-\nage and its switching frequency is adjustable up to1MHz through an external resistor. The MAX8521 isalso available in a 5mm x 5mm TQFN as well asspace-saving 3mm x 3mm UCSP™ and 36-bump WLP(3mm x 3mm) packages, with a pin-selectable switch-ing frequency of 500kHz or 1MHz.\nApplications\nSFF/SFP Modules\nFiber Optic Laser ModulesFiber Optic Network EquipmentATEBiotech Lab EquipmentFeatures\noCircuit Footprint 0.31in2\noLow Profile Design\noOn-Chip Power MOSFETs\noHigh-Efficiency Switch-Mode Design\noRipple Cancellation for Low Noise\noDirect Current Control Prevents TEC Current\nSurges\no5% Accurate Adjustable Heating/Cooling Current\nLimits\no2% Accurate TEC Voltage Limit\noNo Dead Zone or Hunting at Low Output Current\noITEC Monitors TEC Current \no1% Accurate Voltage Reference\noSwitching Frequency up to 1MHz \noSynchronization (MAX8521)\nMAX8520/MAX8521Smallest TEC Power Drivers for Optical\nModules\n________________________________________________________________ Maxim Integrated Products 1Ordering Information19-2586; Rev 2; 2/11\nFor pricing, delivery, and ordering information, please contact Maxim Direct at 1-888-629-4642,\nor visit Maxim’s website at www.maxim-ic.com.EVALUATION KIT\nAVAILABLE\nPART TEMP RANGE PIN-PACKAGE\nMAX8520 ETP+ -40°C to +85 °C20 TQFN - E P * 5m m  x 5m m \nMAX8521 EBX -40°C to +85 °C6 x 6 U C S P  3m m  x 3m m \nMAX8521ETP+ -40°C to +85 °C20 TQFN - E P * 5m m  x 5m m \nMAX8521EWX+ -40°C to +85 °C36 WLP ** 3m m  x 3m m \nUCSP is a trademark of Maxim Integrated Products, Inc.INPUT\n3V TO 5.5VVDD\nPVDD_\nCOMP\nGNDSHDN\nITECON\nOFF\nTEC CURRENT\nMONITOR\nCTLILX1\nPGND1\nCS\nOS1\nOS2\nLX2\nPGND2TECITEC = ± 1.5A\nREFCURRENT-\nCONTROL\nSIGNALFREQ\nANALOG /DIGITAL\nTEMPERATURE  CONTROLOUTPUTMAX8521Typical Operating Circuit\nPin Configurations appear at end of data sheet+Denotes a lead(Pb)-free/RoHS-compliant package.\n*EP = Exposed pad.\n**Four center bumps depopulated.\nMAX8520/MAX8521Smallest TEC Power Drivers for Optical\nModules\n2 _______________________________________________________________________________________ABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nStresses beyond those listed under “Absolute Maximum Ratings” may cause permanent damage to the device.

This configuration cre-ates a differential voltage across the TEC, allowing bi-directional TEC current for controlled cooling andheating. Controlled cooling and heating allow accurateTEC temperature control to within 0.01°C. The voltage atCTLI directly sets the TEC current. An external thermal-control loop is typically used to drive CTLI. Figures 1and 2 show examples of the thermal-control-loop circuit.\nRipple Cancellation\nSwitching regulators like those used in the MAX8520/MAX8521 inherently create ripple voltage on the output.The dual regulators in the MAX8520/MAX8521 switchin-phase and provide complementary in-phase dutycycles so ripple waveforms at the TEC are greatlyreduced. This feature suppresses ripple currents andelectrical noise at the TEC to prevent interference withthe laser diode.\nSwitching Frequency\nFor the MAX8521, FREQ sets the switching frequencyof the internal oscillator. With FREQ = GND, the oscilla-tor frequency is set to 500kHz. The oscillator frequencyis 1MHz when FREQ = V\nDD. \nFor the MAX8520, connect a resistor (R EXTin Figure 2)\nfrom FREQ to GND. Choose R EXT= 60kΩfor 1MHz\noperation, and R EXT= 150kΩfor 500KHz operation. For\nany intermediary frequency between 500kHz and1MHz, use the following equation to find the value ofR\nEXTvalue needed for V DD= 5V:\nwhere R EXTis the resistance given in k Ω, and fs is the\ndesired frequency given in MHz. Note that for V DD<\n5V, the frequency is reduced slightly, to the extent ofabout 7% when V\nDDreaches 3V. This should be taken\ninto consideration when selecting the value for R EXTat\nknown supply voltage.\nVoltage and Current-Limit Setting\nBoth the MAX8520 and MAX8521 provide control of themaximum differential TEC voltage. Applying a voltageto MAXV limits the maximum voltage across the TEC.The voltage at MAXIP and MAXIN sets the maximumpositive and negative current through the TEC. Thesecurrent limits can be independently controlled. Current Monitor Output\nITEC provides a voltage output proportional to the TECcurrent (I\nTEC). See the Functional Diagram for more\ndetail:\nVITEC = 1.5V +(8 \x15(VOS1-VCS))\nReference Output\nThe MAX8520/MAX8521 include an on-chip voltage ref-\nerence. The 1.50V reference is accurate to 1% overtemperature. Bypass REF with 0.1µF to GND. REF canbe used to bias an external thermistor for temperaturesensing as shown in Figures 1 and 2.\nThermal and Fault-Current Protection\nThe MAX8520/MAX8521 provide fault-current protec-tion in either FETs by turning off both high-side andlow-side FETs when the peak current exceeds 3A ineither FETs. In addition, thermal-overload protectionlimits the total power dissipation in the chip. When thedevice’s die junction temperature exceeds +165°C, anon-chip thermal sensor shuts down the device. Thethermal sensor turns the device on again after the junc-tion temperature cools down by +15°C.\nDesign Procedures\nDuty-Cycle Range Selection\nBy design, the MAX8520/MAX8521 are capable ofoperating from 0% to 100% duty cycle, allowing bothLX outputs to enter dropout. However, as the LX pulsewidth narrows, accurate duty-cycle control becomesdifficult. This can result in a low-frequency noiseappearing at the TEC output (typically in the 20kHz to50kHz range). While this noise is typically filtered out bythe low thermal-loop bandwidth, for best result, operatethe PWM with a pulse width greater than 200ns. For500kHz application, the recommended duty-cyclerange is from 10% to 90%. For 1MHz application, it isfrom 20% to 80%.

At zeroTEC current, the differential voltage is zero, hence theoutputs with respect to GND are equal to half of V\nDD.\nAs the TEC current demand increases, one output willgo up and the other will go down from the initial point of0.5V\nDDby an amount equal to 0.5 \x15VTEC(VTEC= ITEC\n\x15RTEC). Therefore, the operating duty cycle of each\nbuck converter depends on the operating I TEC and\nRTEC. Since inductor current calculation for heating and\ncooling are identical, but reverse in polarity, the calcu-lation only needs to be carried out for either one.\nFor a given inductor, and input voltage, the maximum\ninductor ripple current happens when the duty cycle isat 50%. Therefore, the inductor should be calculated at50% duty cycle to find the maximum ripple current. Themaximum desired ripple current of a typical standardbuck converter is in the range of 20% to 40% of themaximum load. The higher the value of the inductor, thelower the ripple current. However, the size will be phys-ically larger. For the TEC driver the thermal loop isinherently slow, so the inductor can be larger for lowerripple current for better noise and EMI performance.Picking an inductor to yield ripple current of 10% to20% of the maximum TEC current is a good startingpoint.Calculate the inductor value as follows:\nwhere LIR is the selected inductor ripple-current ratio,\nI\nTEC(MAX) is the maximum TEC current, and fs is the\nswitching frequency\nAs an example, for V DD= 3.3V, LIR = 12%, and fs =\n1MHz, L = 4.58µH\nEven though each inductor ripple current is at its maxi-\nmum at 50% duty cycle (zero TEC current), the ripplecancels differentially because each is equal and in-phase.\nOutput Filter Capacitor Selection\nCommon-Mode Filter Capacitors\nThe common-mode filter capacitors (C2 and C7 ofFigure 1) are used as filter capacitors to ground foreach output. The output ripple voltage depends on thecapacitance, the ESR of these capacitors, and theinductor ripple current. Ceramic capacitors are recom-mended for their low ESR and impedance at high fre-quency.

Functional Diagram of the Current-Control Loop\nMAX8520/MAX8521The output common-mode ripple voltage can be calcu-\nlated as follows:\nVRIPPLEpk-pk = LIR x I TEC(MAX) (ESR + 1/8 x C x fs)\nA 1µF ceramic capacitor with ESR of 10 m Ωwith LIR =\n12% and I TEC(MAX) = 1.5A will result in V RIPPLE(P-P) of\n24.3mV. For size-constraint application, the capacitorcan be made smaller at the expense of higher ripplevoltage. However, the capacitance must be highenough so that the LC resonant frequency is less than1/5 the switching frequency:\nwhere f is the resonant frequency of the output filter.\nDifferential Mode Filter Capacitor\nThe differential-mode filter capacitor (C5 in Figure 1) is\nused to bypass differential ripple current through theTEC as the result of unequal duty cycle of each output.This happens when the TEC current is not at zero. AsTEC current increases from zero, both outputs moveaway from the 50% duty-cycle point complementarily.The common-mode ripple decreases, but the differentialripple does not cancel perfectly, and there will be aresulting differential ripple. The maximum value happenswhen one output is at 75% duty cycle and the other is at25% duty cycle. At this operating point, the differentialripple is equal to 1/2 of the maximum common-mode rip-ple. The TEC ripple current determines the TEC perfor-mance, because the maximum temperature differentialthat can be created between the terminals of the TECdepends on the ratio of ripple current and DC current.The lower the ripple current, the closer to the ideal maxi-mum. The differential-mode capacitor provides a low-impedance path for the ripple current to flow, so that theTEC ripple current is greatly reduced. The TEC ripplecurrent then can be calculated as follows:\nI\nTEC(RIPPLE) = (0.5 x LIR x I TEC(MAX) ) x (Z C5)/(RTEC\n+ RSENSE + ZC5)\nwhere Z C5is the impedance of C5 at twice the switching\nfrequency, R TECis the TEC equivalent resistance, and\nRSENSE is the current-sense resistor.\nDecoupling Capacitor Selection\nDecouple each power supply input (V DD, PVDD1,\nPVDD2) with a 1µF ceramic capacitor close to the sup-ply pins. In applications with long distances betweenthe source supply and the MAX8520/MAX8521, addi-tional bypassing may be needed to stabilize the input\nsupply. In such cases, a low-ESR electrolytic or ceramiccapacitor of 100µF or more at V\nDDis sufficient.\nCompensation Capacitor\nA compensation capacitor is needed to ensure current-control-loop stability (see Figure 3). Select the capacitorso that the unity-gain bandwidth of the current-controlloop is less than or equal to 10% the resonant frequencyof the output filter:\nwhere:\nf\nBW= Unity-gain bandwidth frequency, less than or\nequal to 10% the output filter resonant frequency\ngm= Loop transconductance, typically 100µA/V\nCCOMP = Value of the compensation capacitor\nRTEC= TEC series resistance, use the minimum resis-\ntance value\nRSENSE = Sense resistor\nSetting Voltage and Current Limits\nCertain TEC parameters must be considered to guarantee\na robust design. These include maximum positive current,maximum negative current, and the maximum voltageallowed across the TEC. These limits should be used toset the MAXIP, MAXIN, and MAXV voltages.\nSetting Max Positive and Negative TEC Current\nMAXIP and MAXIN set the maximum positive and nega-tive TEC currents, respectively. The default current limitis ±150mV/R\nSENSE when MAXIP and MAXIN are con-\nnected to REF. To set maximum limits other than thedefaults, connect a resistor-divider from REF to GND toset V\nMAXI_ . Use resistors in the 10k Ωto 100kΩrange.\nVMAXI_ is related to ITEC by the following equations:\nVMAXIP = 10(I TECP(MAX) \x15RSENSE )\nVMAXIN = 10(I TECN(MAX) \x15RSENSE )\nwhere I TECP(MAX) is the maximum positive TEC current\nand I TECN(MAX) is the negative maximum TEC current.\nPositive TEC current occurs when CS is less than OS1:\nITECx RSENSE = OS1 - CS\nwhen I TEC> 0A.\nITEC \x15RSENSE = CS - OS1\nwhen I TEC< 0A.Cg\nfR\nRRCOMPm\nBWSENSE\nSENSE TEC≥⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟××\n×⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟24\n2π()\n f\nLC=1\n2πSmallest TEC Power Drivers for Optical\nModules\n14 ______________________________________________________________________________________\nTake care not to exceed the positive or negative cur-\nrent limit on the TEC.

The voltage across the TEC is four times\nVMAXV and can be positive or negative:\n|VOS1- VOS2| = 4 x V MAXV or VDD, whichever is lower\nSet V MAXV with a resistor-divider between REF and\nGND using resistors from 10k Ωto 100kΩ. VMAXV can\nvary from 0V to V REF.\nControl Inputs/Outputs\nOutput Current Control\nThe voltage at CTLI directly sets the TEC current. CTLIis typically driven from the output of a temperature con-trol loop. The transfer function relating current throughthe TEC (I\nTEC) and V CTLI is given by:\nITEC= (V CTLI - VREF)/(10 \x15RSENSE )\nwhere V REFis 1.50V and:\nITEC = (V OS1- VCS)/RSENSE\nCTLI is centered around REF (1.50V). I TECis zero when\nCTLI = 1.50V. When V CTLI> 1.50V the current flow is from\nOS2 to OS1. The voltages on the pins relate as follows:\nVOS2> VOS1> VCS\nThe opposite applies when V CTLI < 1.50V current flows\nfrom OS1 to OS2:\nVOS2< VOS1< VCS\nShutdown Control\nThe MAX8520/MAX8521 can be placed in a power-saving\nshutdown mode by driving SHDN low. When the\nMAX8520/MAX8521 are shut down, the TEC is off (OS1and OS2 decay to GND) and supply current is reduced to2mA (typ).\nITEC Output\nITEC is a status output that provides a voltage proportionalto the actual TEC current. V\nITEC = VREFwhen TEC current\nis zero. The transfer function for the ITEC output is:\nVITEC = 1.50V + 8 \x15(VOS1– VCS)\nUse ITEC to monitor the cooling or heating current\nthrough the TEC. For stability keep the load capaci-tance on ITEC to less than 150pF.Applications Information\nThe MAX8520/MAX8521 typically drive a thermo-elec-tric cooler inside a thermal-control loop. TEC drivepolarity and power are regulated based on temperatureinformation read from a thermistor or other temperature-measuring device to maintain a stable control tempera-ture. Temperature stability of +0.01°C can be achievedwith carefully selected external components.\nThere are numerous ways to implement the thermal loop.\nFigures 1 and 2 show designs that employ precision opamps, along with a DAC or potentiometer to set the con-trol temperature. The loop can also be implemented digi-tally, using a precision A/D to read the thermistor or othertemperature sensor, a microcontroller to implement thecontrol algorithm, and a DAC (or filtered-PWM signal) tosend the appropriate signal to the MAX8520/MAX8521CTLI input. Regardless of the form taken by the thermal-control circuitry, all designs are similar in that they readtemperature, compare it to a set-point signal, and thensend an error-correcting signal to the MAX8520/MAX8521 that moves the temperature in the appropriatedirection.\nPCB Layout and Routing\nHigh switching frequencies and large peak currentsmake PCB layout a very important part of design. Gooddesign minimizes excessive EMI and voltage gradientsin the ground plane, both of which can result in instabil-ity or regulation errors. Follow these guidelines for goodPCB layout:\n1) Place decoupling capacitors as close to the IC pins\nas possible.\n2) Keep a separate power ground plane, which is con-\nnected to PGND1 and PGND2. PVDD1, PVDD2,PGND1 and PGND2 are noisy points. Connect decou-pling capacitors from PVDD_ to PGND_ as direct aspossible. Output capacitors C2, C7 returns are con-nected to PGND plane.\n3) Connect a decoupling capacitor from V\nDDto GND.\nConnect GND to a signal ground plane (separate fromthe power ground plane above). Other V\nDDdecoupling\ncapacitors (such as the input capacitor) need to beconnected to the PGND plane.\n4) Connect GND and PGND_ pins together at a single\npoint, as close as possible to the chip.\n5) Keep the power loop, which consists of input capaci-\ntors, output inductors and capacitors, as compact andsmall as possible.\nMAX8520/MAX8521Smallest TEC Power Drivers for Optical\nModules\n______________________________________________________________________________________ 15\nMAX8520/MAX85216) To ensure high DC-loop gain and minimum loop\nerror, keep the board layout adjacent to the negativeinput pin of the integrator (U2 in Figure1) clean and freeof moisture. Any contamination or leakage current intothis node can act to lower the DC gain of the integratorwhich can degrade the accuracy of the thermal loop. Ifspace is available, it can also be helpful to surround thenegative input node of the integrator with a groundedguard ring.Refer to the MAX8520/MAX8521 evaluation kit for a\nPCB layout example.\nChip Information\nPROCESS: BiCMOSSmallest TEC Power Drivers for Optical\nModules\n16 ______________________________________________________________________________________\n20\n19\n18\n17PVDD1\nOS1\nOS2\nCS\n16 PVDD2\n13\n12\n111415\nVDDFREQPGND2LX2\nGND4321\nCOMPSHDNPGND1LX1\n5 ITEC\n6\n7\n8\n9MAXIM\nMAXIP\nMAXV\nREF\n10 CTLIMAX8520/\nMAX8521TOP VIEW\nCONNECT EP TO GNDTQFN+\nEPF6\nPVDD2\nLX2 LX2 LX1 LX1\nPGND2 PGND2 PGND2 PGND1 PGND1 PGND1\nOS2 FREQ GND2 GND2 COMP SHDN\nVDD GND2 GND2 ITEC\nGND CTLI REF MAXV\nMAX8521MAXIP MAXINPVDD2 CS OS1 PVDD1 PVDD1F5 F4 F3 F2 F1\nE6 E5 E2 E1\nD6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1C6 C5 C4 C3 C2 C1\nB6 B5 B2 B1A6 A5 A4 A3 A2 A1\n+\nUCSP/WLPTOP VIEW\nBUMPS ON BOTTOMPin Configurations\nPackage Information\nFor the latest package outline information and land patterns (footprints), go to www.maxim-ic.com/packages .
