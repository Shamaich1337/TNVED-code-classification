The TLV1117LV LDO is also \nstable with 0 mA of load current; there is no \nminimum load requirement, making the device a \ngood choice for applications where the regulator must \npower very small loads during standby in addition \nto large currents on the order of 1 A during normal \noperation. The TLV1117LV offers excellent line and \nload transient performance, resulting in very small \nmagnitude undershoots and overshoots of output \nvoltage when the load current requirement changes \nfrom less than 1 mA to more than 500 mA.\nA precision band-gap and error amplifier provides \n1.5% accuracy. A very high power-supply rejection \nratio (PSRR) enables use of the device for post-\nregulation after a switching regulator. Other valuable \nfeatures include low output noise and low-dropout \nvoltage.\nThe device is internally compensated to be stable with \n0-Ω equivalent series resistance (ESR) capacitors. \nThese key advantages enable the use of cost-\neffective, small-size ceramic capacitors. Cost-effective \ncapacitors that have higher bias voltages and \ntemperature derating can also be used if desired.\nThe TLV1117LV is available in a SOT-223 package.\nPackage Information\nPART NUMBER PACKAGE(1)BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTLV1117LV DCY (SOT-223, 4) 6.50 mm × 3.50 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nINPUT OUTPUT\nGNDDeviceCIN \n1 µFCOUT \n1 µF\nTypical Application CircuitTLV1117LV\nSBVS160C  – MAY 2011 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

This \ndevice features an integrated current limit, thermal shutdown, band-gap reference, and undervoltage lockout \n(UVLO) circuit blocks.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\nCurrent\nLimit\nBandgapThermal\nShutdownIN OUT\nLOGIC\nGNDTLV1117LV SeriesUVLO\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Internal Current Limit\nThe TLV1117LV internal current limit helps protect the regulator during fault conditions. During current limit, the \noutput sources a fixed amount of current that is largely independent of the output voltage. In such a case, the \noutput voltage is not regulated, and can be calculated by the formula: V OUT = I LIMIT × R LOAD. The PMOS pass \ntransistor dissipates (V IN – V OUT) × I LIMIT until thermal shutdown is triggered and the device turns off. When \nthe device cools down, the internal thermal shutdown circuit turns the device back on. If the fault condition \ncontinues, the device cycles between current limit and thermal shutdown. See the Thermal Protection  section for \nmore details.\nThe PMOS pass transistor in the TLV1117LV has a built-in body diode that conducts current when the voltage at \nOUT exceeds the voltage at IN. This current is not limited; if extended reverse voltage operation is anticipated, \nexternal limiting to 5% of the rated output current is recommended.\n7.3.2 Dropout Voltage\nThe TLV1117LV uses a PMOS pass transistor to achieve low dropout. When (V IN – V OUT) is less than the \ndropout voltage (V DO), the PMOS pass transistor is in the linear region of operation and the input-to-output \nresistance is the R DS(ON)  of the PMOS pass transistor. V DO scales approximately with output current because the \nPMOS transistor behaves like a resistor in dropout.\nAs with any linear regulator, PSRR and transient response are degraded when (V IN – V OUT) approaches dropout.\nwww.ti.comTLV1117LV\nSBVS160C – MAY 2011 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TLV1117LV\n7.3.3 Undervoltage Lockout\nThe TLV1117LV uses an undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit to keep the output shut off until internal circuitry is \noperating properly.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Normal Operation\nThe device regulates to the nominal output voltage under the following conditions:\n•The input voltage is greater than the nominal output voltage added to the dropout voltage\n•The output current is less than the current limit\n•The device die temperature is lower than the thermal shutdown temperature\n7.4.2 Dropout Operation\nIf the input voltage is lower than the nominal output voltage plus the specified dropout voltage, but all other \nconditions are met for normal operation, the device operates in dropout mode. In this condition, the output \nvoltage is the same the input voltage minus the dropout voltage. The transient performance of the device is \nsignificantly degraded because the pass transistor is in a triode state and no longer controls the current through \nthe LDO. Line or load transients in dropout can result in large output voltage deviations.\nTable 7-1  shows the conditions that lead to the different modes of operation.\nTable 7-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TLV1117LV is a low quiescent current linear regulator designed for high current applications. Unlike typical \nhigh current linear regulators, the TLV1117LV consumes significantly less quiescent current. This device delivers \nexcellent line and load transient performance. The device is low noise, and exhibits a very good PSRR. As a \nresult, this device is designed for high current applications that require very sensitive power-supply rails.\nThis regulators offer both current limit and thermal protection. The operating junction temperature range of the \ndevice is –40°C to +125°C.\n8.2 Typical Application\nFigure 8-1  shows a typical application circuit.\nINPUT OUTPUT\nGNDDeviceCIN \n1 µFCOUT \n1 µF\nFigure 8-1. Typical Application Circuit\n8.2.1 Design Requirements\nFor this design example, use the parameters listed in Table 8-1  as the input parameters.\nTable 8-1. Design Parameters\nPARAMETER DESIGN REQUIREMENT\nInput voltage 2.5 V to 3.3 V\nOutput voltage 1.8 V\nOutput current 500 mA\n8.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n8.2.2.1 Input and Output Capacitor Requirements\nFor stability, 1.0- μF ceramic capacitors are required at the output. Higher-valued capacitors improve transient \nperformance. Use X5R- and X7R-type ceramic capacitors because these capacitors have minimal variation in \nvalue and equivalent series resistance (ESR) over temperature. Unlike traditional linear regulators that need \na minimum ESR for stability, the TLV1117LV is specified to be stable with no ESR. Therefore, cost-effective \nceramic capacitors can be used with this device. Effective output capacitance that takes bias, temperature, and \naging effects into consideration must be greater than 0.5 μF to ensure stability of the device.\nAlthough an input capacitor is not required for stability, good analog design practice is to connect a 0.1- μF to \n1.0-μ F, low-ESR capacitor across the IN pin and GND pin of the regulator. This capacitor counteracts reactive \ninput sources and improves transient response, noise rejection, and ripple rejection. A higher-value capacitor \ncan be necessary if large, fast rise-time load transients are anticipated, or if the device is not located physically \nwww.ti.comTLV1117LV\nSBVS160C – MAY 2011 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TLV1117LV\nclose to the power source. If source impedance is greater than 2 Ω, a 0.1- μF input capacitor can also be \nnecessary to ensure stability.\n8.2.2.2 Transient Response\nAs with any regulator, increasing the size of the output capacitor reduces overshoot and undershoot magnitude.\n8.2.3 Application Curves\nV = 2.8 VIN\n50 s/div/c10950 mV/div200 mA/divIOUT\nVOUT200 mA500 mA\nFigure 8-2.

Line Transient Response V OUT = 1.8 V, \nIOUT = 500 mA\n8.3 Best Design Practices\nPlace input and output capacitors as close to the device as possible.\nUse a ceramic output capacitor.\nDo not use an electrolytic output capacitor.\nDo not exceed the device absolute maximum ratings.\n8.4 Power Supply Recommendations\nConnect a low output impedance power supply directly to the INPUT pin of the TLV1117LV. Inductive \nimpedances between the input supply and the INPUT pin can create significant voltage excursions at the INPUT \npin during start-up or load transient events.\n8.5 Layout\n8.5.1 Layout Guidelines\nPlace input and output capacitors as close to the device pins as possible. To improve characteristic AC \nperformance (such as PSRR, output noise, and transient response), design the board with separate ground \nplanes for V IN and V OUT, with the ground plane connected only at the GND pin of the device. In addition, the \nground connection for the output capacitor must be connected directly to the GND pin of the device. Higher \nvalue ESR capacitors can degrade PSRR performance.\n8.5.1.1 Thermal Protection\nThermal protection disables the output when the junction temperature rises to approximately 165°C, allowing \nthe device to cool. When the junction temperature cools to approximately 145°C, the output circuitry is again \nenabled. Depending on power dissipation, thermal resistance, and ambient temperature, the thermal protection \ncircuit can cycle on and off. This cycling limits the dissipation of the regulator, protecting the regulator from \ndamage as a result of overheating.\nAny tendency to activate the thermal protection circuit indicates excessive power dissipation or an inadequate \nheat sink. For reliable operation, limit junction temperature to 125°C maximum. To estimate the margin of safety \nin a complete design (including heat sink), increase the ambient temperature until the thermal protection is \ntriggered; use worst-case loads and signal conditions.TLV1117LV\nSBVS160C – MAY 2011 – REVISED JANUARY 2023\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TLV1117LV\nThe internal protection circuitry of the TLV1117LV is designed to protect against overload conditions. This \ncircuitry is not intended to replace proper heat sinking. Continuously running the TLV1117LV into thermal \nshutdown degrades device reliability.\n8.5.1.2 Power Dissipation\nThe ability to remove heat from the die is different for each package type, presenting different considerations in \nthe printed circuit board (PCB) layout. The PCB area around the device that is free of other components moves \nthe heat from the device to the ambient air. Performance data for JEDEC low and high-K boards are given in the \nThermal Information  table. Using heavier copper increases the effectiveness in removing heat from the device. \nThe addition of plated through-holes to heat-dissipating layers also improves heat-sink effectiveness.\nPower dissipation depends on input voltage and load conditions. Power dissipation (P D) is equal to the product \nof the output current and the voltage drop across the output pass element, as shown in Equation 1 :\nP =□(V V )□I /c45D IN OUT OUT\n(1)\n8.5.2 Layout Example\nTab\n1 2COUT\n3OUTPUT\nGNDINPUTGND\nCIN\nFigure 8-4.
