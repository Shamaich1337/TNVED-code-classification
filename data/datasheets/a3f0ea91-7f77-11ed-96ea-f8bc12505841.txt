For supply voltages between 4 V and 30 V, the device acts as a high impedance, constant current regulator passing 1 μA/K. Laser trimming of the chip ’s thin-film resistors is used \nto calibrate the device to 298.2 μA output at 298.2 K (25°C).  \nThe AD590 should be used in any temperature-sensing \napplication below 150°C in which conventional electrical \ntemperature sensors are currently employed. The inherent  \nlow cost of a monolithic integrated circuit combined with the elimination of support circuitry makes the AD590 an attractive alternative for many temperature measurement situations. Linearization circuitry, precision voltage amplifiers, resistance \nmeasuring circuitry, and cold junction compensation are not \nneeded in applying the AD590. \nIn addition to temperature measurement, applications include \ntemperature compensation or correction of discrete components, biasing proportional to absolute temperature, flow rate measure-ment, level detection of fluids and anemometry. The AD590 is available in die form, making it suitable for hybrid circuits and fast temperature measurements in protected environments.  \nThe AD590 is particularly useful in remote sensing applications. \nThe device is insensitive to voltage drops over long lines due to \nits high impedance current output. Any well-insulated twisted pair is sufficient for operation at hundreds of feet from the receiving circuitry. The output characteristics also make the AD590 easy to multiplex: the current can be switched by a CMOS multiplexer, or the supply voltage can be switched by a logic gate output.

The AD590 is a calibrated, 2-terminal temperature sensor \nrequiring only a dc voltage supply (4 V to 30 V). Costly \ntransmitters, filters, lead wire compensation, and lineari-\nzation circuits are all unnecessary in applying the device.  \n2. State-of-the-art laser trimming at the wafer level in \nconjunction with extensive final testing ensures that \nAD590 units are easily interchangeable. \n3. Superior interface rejection occurs because the output is a \ncurrent rather than a voltage. In addition, power requirements are low (1.5 mW @ 5 V @ 25°C). These features make the AD590 easy to apply as a remote sensor.  \n4. The high output impedance (>10 MΩ) provides excellent rejection of supply voltage drift. For instance, changing the power supply from 5 V to 10 V results in only a 1 μA \nmaximum current change, or 1°C equivalent error. \n5. The AD590 is electrically durable: it withstands a forward \nvoltage of up to 44 V and a reverse voltage of 20 V . Therefore, supply irregularities or pin reversal does not damage the device. \n \n00533-024 +–1V+\n2V–4N C\n3N C\n00533-104AD590\nTOP VIEW\n(Not to Scale)\nPIN 5 (EXPOSED PAD)\nNOTES\n1.

G | Page 6 of 16 PRODUCT DESCRIPTION \nThe AD590 is a 2-terminal temperature-to-voltage transducer. It \nis available in a variety of accuracy grades and packages. When using the AD590 in die form, the chip substrate must be kept \nelectrically isolated (floating) for correct circuit operation. \nFigure 6. Metallization Diagram \nThe AD590 uses a fundamental property of the silicon \ntransistors from which it is made to realize its temperature proportional characteristic: if two identical transistors are \noperated at a constant ratio of collector current densities, r,  \nthen the difference in their base-emitter voltage is (kT/q)(In r). Because both k (Boltzman’s constant) and q (the charge of an electron) are constant, the resulting voltage is directly pro-portional to absolute temperature (PTAT). (For a more detailed description, see M.P . Timko, “ A Two-Terminal IC Temperature \nTransducer, ” IEEE J. Solid State Circuits, Vol. SC-11, p. 784-788, \nDec. 1976. Understanding the Specifications–AD590.) \nIn the AD590, this PTAT voltage is converted to a PTAT current \nby low temperature coefficient thin-film resistors. The total current of the device is then forced to be a multiple of this PTAT current. Figure 7 is the schematic diagram of the AD590. In this figure, Q8 and Q11 are the transistors that produce the \nPTAT voltage. R5 and R6 convert the voltage to current. Q10, \nwhose collector current tracks the collector currents in Q9 and Q11, supplies all the bias and substrate leakage current for the rest of the circuit, forcing the total current to be PTAT. R5 and \nR6 are laser-trimmed on the wafer to calibrate the device at 25°C. \n Figure 8 shows the typical V–I characteristic of the circuit at \n25°C and the temperature extremes.  \n \nFigure 7.

G | Page 7 of 16 EXPLANATION OF TEMPERATURE SENSOR \nSPECIFICATIONS \nThe way in which the AD590 is specified makes it easy to apply \nit in a wide variety of applications. It is important to understand \nthe meaning of the various specifications and the effects of the supply voltage and thermal environment on accuracy.  \nThe AD590 is a PTAT current regulator. (Note that T (°C) = \nT (K) − 273.2. Zero on the Kelvin scale is absolute zero; there is \nno lower temperature.) That is, the output current is equal to a scale factor times the temperature of the sensor in degrees Kelvin. This scale factor is trimmed to 1 μA/K at the factory, by adjusting the indicated temperature (that is, the output current) \nto agree with the actual temperature. This is done with 5 V \nacross the device at a temperature within a few degrees of 25°C (298.2 K). The device is then packaged and tested for accuracy \nover temperature.  \nCALIBRATION ERROR \nAt final factory test, the difference between the indicated \ntemperature and the actual temperature is called the calibration \nerror. Since this is a scale factory error, its contribution to the \ntotal error of the device is PTAT. For example, the effect of the \n1°C specified maximum error of the AD590L varies from 0.73°C at −55°C to 1.42°C at 150°C. Figure 9 shows how an exaggerated \ncalibration error would vary from the ideal over temperature. \n \nFigure 9. Calibration Error vs. Temperature \nThe calibration error is a primary contributor to the maximum \ntotal error in all AD590 grades. However, because it is a scale \nfactor error, it is particularly easy to trim. Figure 10 shows the \nmost elementary way of accomplishing this.  \nTo trim this circuit, the temperature of the AD590 is measured \nby a reference temperature sensor and R is trimmed so that V T \n= 1 mV/K at that temperature. Note that when this error is trimmed out at one temperature, its effect is zero over the entire temperature range. In most applications, there is a current-to-voltage conversion resistor (or, as with a current input ADC, a \nreference) that can be trimmed for scale factor adjustment. \n \nFigure 10. One Temperature Trim \nERROR VS. TEMPERATURE: CALIBRATION ERROR \nTRIMMED OUT \nEach AD590 is tested for error over the temperature range with \nthe calibration error trimmed out. This specification could also be called the variance from PTAT, because it is the maximum \ndifference between the actual current over temperature and a PTAT multiplication of the actual current at 25°C. This error consists of a slope error and some curvature, mostly at the temperature extremes. Figure 11 shows a typical AD590K \ntemperature curve before and after calibration error trimming. \n \nFigure 11. Effect to Scale Factor Trim on Accuracy \nERROR VS. TEMPERATURE: NO USER TRIMS \nUsing the AD590 by simply measuring the current, the total \nerror is the variance from PTAT, described above, plus the effect \nof the calibration error over temperature. For example, the AD590L maximum total error varies from 2.33°C at −55°C to 3.02°C at 150°C. For simplicity, only the large figure is shown on the specification page. \n \n  \n   \n 00533-006IACTUAL\n298.2IOUT (µA)\n298.2\nTEMPERATURE (°K)ACTUAL\nTRANSFER\nFUNCTION\nIDEAL\nTRANSFER\nFUNCTIONCALIBRATION\nERROR\n00533-0075V\nR\n100ΩVT = 1mV/KAD590\n950Ω+\n–+\n–+\n–\nAFTER\nCALIBRATIONTRIM\n00533-008ABSOLUTE ERROR (°C)2\n0\n–2\n–55 150\nTEMPERATURE (°C)CALIBRATION\nERRORBEFORE\nCALIBRATIONTRIM\nAD590 Data Sheet\n \nRev. G | Page 8 of 16 NONLINEARITY \nNonlinearity as it applies to the AD590 is the maximum \ndeviation of current over temperature from a best-fit straight \nline. The nonlinearity of the AD590 over the −55°C to +150°C range is superior to all conven tional electrical temperature \nsensors such as thermocouples, RTDs, and thermistors. Figure 12 \nshows the nonlinearity of the typical AD590K from Figure 11. \n \nFigure 12. Nonlinearity \nFigure 13 shows a circuit in which the nonlinearity is the major \ncontributor to error over temperature. The circuit is trimmed by adjusting R1 for a 0 V output with the AD590 at 0°C. R2 is \nthen adjusted for 10 V output with the sensor at 100°C. Other \npairs of temperatures can be used with this procedure as long as they are measured accurately by a reference sensor. Note that for 15 V output (150°C), the V+ of the op amp must be greater than 17 V . Also, note that V− should be at least −4 V; if V− is ground, there is no voltage applied across the device. \n \nFigure 13. 2-Temperature Trim \n  \nFigure 14. Typical 2-Trim Accuracy \nVOLTAGE AND THERMAL ENVIRONMENT EFFECTS \nThe power supply rejection specifications show the maximum \nexpected change in output current vs. input voltage changes. \nThe insensitivity of the output to input voltage allows the use of unregulated supplies. It also means that hundreds of ohms of resistance (such as a CMOS multiplexer) can be tolerated in \nseries with the device.  \nIt is important to note that using a supply voltage other than 5 V \ndoes not change the PTAT nature of the AD590. In other words, this change is equivalent to a calibration error and can be removed by the scale factor trim (see Figure 11).  \nThe AD590 specifications are guaranteed for use in a low \nthermal resistance environment with 5 V across the sensor. Large changes in the thermal resistance of the sensor’s environment change the amount of self-heating and result in changes in the \noutput, which are predictable but not necessarily desirable.  \nThe thermal environment in which the AD590 is used \ndetermines two important characteristics: the effect of self-\nheating and the response of the sensor with time. Figure 15 is a \nmodel of the AD590 that demonstrates these characteristics. \n \nFigure 15.

G | Page 9 of 16 As an example, for the TO-52 package, θ JC is the thermal \nresistance between the chip and the case, about 26°C/W . θ CA is \nthe thermal resistance between the case and the surroundings \nand is determined by the characteristics of the thermal \nconnection. Power source P represents the power dissipated  \non the chip. The rise of the junction temperature, T J, above the \nambient temperature, T A, is \nTJ − TA = P(θJC + θ CA) (1) \nTable 4 gives the sum of θ JC and θ CA for several common \nthermal media for both the H and F packages. The heat sink used was a common clip-on. Using Equation 1, the temperature \nrise of an AD590 H package in a stirred bath at 25°C, when \ndriven with a 5 V supply, is 0.06°C. However, for the same conditions in still air, the temperature rise is 0.72°C. For a given supply voltage, the temperature rise varies with the current and is PTAT. Therefore, if an application circuit is trimmed with the sensor in the same thermal environment in which it is used, the \nscale factor trim compensates for this effect over the entire \ntemperature range.  \nTable 4.

The AD590 is used as a \nthermometer circuit that measures temperature from −55°C to \n+150° C, with an output voltage of 1 mV/ °K. Because  the \nAD590 measures absolute temperature (its nominal output is \n1 mA/K), the output must be offset by 273.2  mA to read out in \ndegrees Celsius.   \n \n \nFigure 17. Variable Scale Display  \nConnecting several AD590 units in series , as shown in Figure 18, \nallows the minimum of all the sensed temperatures to be \nindicated. In contrast, using the sensors in parallel yields the \naverage of the sensed temperatures.  \n \nFigure 18. Series and Parallel Connection  \nThe circuit in Figure 19 demonstrates one method by which \ndifferential temperature measurements can be made. R1 and R 2 \ncan be used to trim the output of the op amp to indicate a \ndesired temperature difference. For example, the inherent offset between the two devices can be trimmed in. If V+ and V− are radically different, then the difference in internal dissipation \ncause s a differential internal temperature rise. This effect can be \nused to measure the ambient thermal resistance seen by the \nsensors in applications such as fluid -level detectors or anemometry.   \nFigure 19. Differential Measurements  \nFigure 20 is an example of a cold junction compensation circuit \nfor a Type J thermocouple using the AD590 to monitor the \nreference junction temperature. This circuit replaces an ice -bath \nas the thermocouple reference for ambient temperatures between 15°C and 35°C. The circuit is calibrated by adjusting R\nT \nfor a proper meter reading with the measuring junction at a \nknown reference temperature and the circuit near 25°C. Using \ncomponents with the TCs as specified in Figure 20, compensation  \naccuracy is within ±0.5°C for circuit temperatures between 15°C \nand 35°C. Other thermocouple types can be accommodated  with \ndifferent resistor values. Note that the TCs of the voltag e \nreference and the resistors are the primary contributors to error.  \n \nFigure 20.

G | Page 11  of 16 Figure 21 is an example of a current transmitter designed to be \nused with 40 V , 1 kΩ systems; it uses its full current range of 4 \nto 20 mA for a narrow span of measured temperatures. In this example, the 1 µA/K output of the AD590 is amplif ied to \n1 mA/°C and offset so that 4 mA is equivalent to 17°C and \n20 mA is equivalent to 33°C. R\nT is trimmed for proper reading \nat an intermediate reference temperature. With a suitable choice of resistors, any temperature range within the operating limits \nof the AD590 can be chosen.  \n \nFigure 21. 4 to 20 mA Current Transmitter  \nFigure 22 is an example of a variable temperature control circuit  \n(thermostat) using the AD590. R H and R L are selected to set the \nhigh and low limits for R SET. R SET could be a simple pot, a \ncalibrated m ultiturn pot, or a switched resistive divider. Powering  \nthe AD590 from the 10 V reference isolates the AD590 from \nsupply variations while maintaining a reasonable voltage (~7 V) across it. Capacitor C1 is often needed to filter extraneous noise from remote  sensors. R\nB is determined by the β of the power \ntransistor and the current requirements of the load.   \nFigure 22. Simple Temperature Control Circuit  \nThe voltage compliance and the reverse blocking characteristic of the AD590 all ow it to be powered directly from 5 V CMOS \nlogic. This permits easy multiplexing, switching, or pulsing for minimum internal heat dissipation. In Figure 23, any AD590 \nconnected to a logic high passes a signal current through the current measuring circuitry, while those connected to a logic \nzero pass insignificant current. The outputs used to drive the \nAD590s can be employed for other purposes, but the additional \ncapacitance due to the AD590 should be taken into account.  \n \nFigure 23.
