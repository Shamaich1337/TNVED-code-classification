General description\nThe PCA9685 is an I2C-bus controlled 16-channel LED controller optimized for \nRed/Green/Blue/Amber (RGBA) color backlight ing applications. Each LED output has its \nown 12-bit resolution (4096 steps) fixed frequency individual PWM controller that operates \nat a programmable frequency from a typical of 24 Hz to 1526 Hz with a duty cycle that is \nadjustable from 0 % to 100 % to  allow the LED to be set to a specific brightness value. \nAll outputs are set to the same PWM frequency.\nEach LED output can be off or on (no PWM control), or set at its individual PWM controller \nvalue. The LED output driver is programmed to be either open-drain with a 25 mA current \nsink capability at 5 V or totem pole with a 25 mA sink, 10 mA source capability at 5 V. The \nPCA9685 operates with a supply voltage rang e of 2.3 V to 5.5 V and the inputs and \noutputs are 5.5 V tolerant. LEDs can be dire ctly connected to the LED output (up to \n25 mA, 5.5 V) or controlled with external dr ivers and a minimum amount of discrete \ncomponents for larger current or higher voltage LEDs.\nThe PCA9685 is in the new Fast-mode Plus (Fm+) family. Fm+ devices offer higher \nfrequency (up to 1 MHz) and more densely populated bus operation (up to 4000 pF).\nAlthough the PCA9635 and PCA9685 have many similar features, the PCA9685 has \nsome unique features that make it more suitable for applications such as LCD or LED \nbacklighting and Ambilight:\n•The PCA9685 allows staggered LED output on and off times to minimize current surges. The on and off time delay is independently programmable for each of the 16 channels. This feature is not available in PCA9635.\n•The PCA9685 has 4096 steps (12-bit PWM) of individual LED brightness control. The \nPCA9635 has only 256 steps (8-bit PWM).\n•When multiple LED controllers are incorporated in a system, the PWM pulse widths between multiple devices may differ if PCA9635s are used. The PCA9685 has a programmable prescaler to adjust the PWM pulse widths of multiple devices.\n•The PCA9685 has an external clock input pin that will accept user-supplied clock \n(50 MHz max.) in place of the internal 25 MHz oscillato r. This feature allows \nsynchronization of multiple devices. The PCA9635 does not have external clock input \nfeature.\n•Like the PCA9635, PCA9685 also has a built-in oscillator for the PWM control. \nHowever, the frequency used for PWM control in the PCA9685 is adjustable from about 24 Hz to 1526 Hz as compared to the typical 97.6 kHz frequency of the PCA9635. This allows the use of PCA9685 with external power supply controllers. All \nbits are set at the same frequency.\n•The Power-On Reset (POR) default state of LE Dn output pins is LOW in the case of \nPCA9685. It is HIGH for PCA9635.PCA9685\n16-channel, 12-bit PWM Fm+ I2C-bus LED controller\nRev. 4 — 16 April 2015 Product data sheet\nPCA9685 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015. All rights res erved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 4 — 16 April 2015 2 of 52NXP Semiconductors PCA9685\n16-channel, 12-bit PWM Fm+ I2C-bus LED controller\nThe active LOW Output Enable input pin (OE ) allows asynchronous control of the LED \noutputs and can be used to set all the outputs to a defined I2C-bus programmable logic \nstate. The OE  can also be used to externally ‘pulse width modulate’ the outputs, which is \nuseful when multiple devices need to be dimmed or blinked together using software \ncontrol.\nSoftware programmable LED All Call and three Sub Call I2C-bus addresses allow all or \ndefined groups of PCA9685 devices to respond to a common I2C-bus address, allowing \nfor example, all red LEDs to be turned on or off at the same time or marquee chasing \neffect, thus minimizing I2C-bus commands. Six hardware address pins allow up to \n62 devices on the same bus.\nThe Software Reset (SWRST) General Call allows the master to perform a reset of the \nPCA9685 through the I2C-bus, identical to th e Power-On Reset (POR) that initializes the \nregisters to their default state causing the outputs to be set LOW. This allows an easy and quick way to reconfigure all device registers to the same condition via software.\n2. Features and benefits\n\uf06e16 LED drivers.

V SS pin must \nbe connected to supply ground for pr oper device operation. For enhanced thermal, electrical, and board \nlevel performance, the exposed pad needs to be soldered to the board using a corresponding thermal pad \non the board and for proper heat conduction through the board, thermal vias need to be incorporated in the \nPCB in the thermal pad region.\n[2] This pin must be grounded when this feature is not used.\n7. Functional description\nRefer to Figure 1 “ Block diagram of PCA9685 ”.\n7.1 Device addresses\nFollowing a START condition, the bus master must output the address of the slave it is \naccessing. \nThere are a maximum of 64 possible programmable addresses using the 6 hardware \naddress pins. Two of these addresses, Software Reset and LED All Call, cannot be used \nbecause their default power-up state is ON, leaving a maximum of 62 addresses. Using \nother reserved addresses, as  well as any other subcall address, will reduce the total \nnumber of possible addresses even further.\n7.1.1 Regular I2C-bus slave address\nThe I2C-bus slave address of the PCA9685 is shown in Figure 4 . To conserve power, no \ninternal pull-up resistors are incorporated on the hardware selectable address pins and they must be pulled HIGH or LOW.\nRemark: Using reserved I\n2C-bus addresses will interfere wit h other devices, but only if \nthe devices are on the bus and/or the bus will be open to other I2C-bus systems at some \nlater date. In a closed system where the designer controls the address assignment these \naddresses can be used since the PCA9685 treats them like any other address. The \nLED All Call, Software Reset and PCA9564 or PCA9665 slave address (if on the bus) can \nnever be used for individual device addresses.\n•PCA9685 LED All Call address (1110 000) and Software Reset (0000 0110) which are \nactive on start-upLED12 19 16 O LED driver 12\nLED13 20 17 O LED driver 13\nLED14 21 18 O LED driver 14\nLED15 22 19 O LED driver 15\nOE 23 20 I active LOW output enable\nA5 24 21 I address input 5\nEXTCLK 25 22 I external clock input[2]\nSCL 26 23 I serial clock line\nSDA 27 24 I/O serial data line\nVDD 28 25 power supply supply voltageTable 3.

This allo ws the user \nto program the registers sequentially.\n[2] It takes 500 \uf06ds max. for the oscillator to be up and running once SLEEP bit has been set to logic 0. Timings on LEDn outputs are not \nguaranteed if PWM control registers are accessed within the 500 \uf06ds window. There is no start-up delay required when using the \nEXTCLK pin as the PWM clock.\n[3] No PWM control is possible when the oscillator is off.\n[4] When the oscillator is off (Sleep mode) the LEDn outputs cannot be turned on, off or dimmed/blinked.Table 5.

The contents of each PWM register are \nheld valid when the clock is off.\nTo restart all of the previously active PWM channels with a few I2C-bus cycles do the \nfollowing steps:\n1. Read MODE1 register.\n2. Check that bit 7 (RESTART) is a logic 1. If it is, clear bit 4 (SLEEP). Allow time for \noscillator to stabilize (500 \uf06ds).\n3. Write logic 1 to bit 7 of MODE1 regist er. All PWM channels will restart and the \nRESTART bit will clear.\nRemark: The SLEEP bit must  be logic 0 for at least 500 \uf06ds, before a logic 1 is written into \nthe RESTART bit.\nOther actions that will cl ear the RESTART bit are:\n1. Power cycle.\n2. I2C Software Reset command.\n3. If the MODE2 OCH bit is logic 0, write to any PWM register then issue an I2C-bus \nSTOP.\n4. If the MODE2 OCH bit is logi c 1, write to all four PWM registers in any PWM channel.\nLikewise, if the user does an orderly shutdown1 of all the PWM channels before setting \nthe SLEEP bit, the RESTART bit will be cleared. If this is done the contents of all PWM \nregisters are invalidated and must be reloaded before reuse.\nAn example of the use of the RESTART bit would be the restoring of a customer’s laptop \nLCD backlight intensity coming out of Standby to the level it was before going into Standby.\n1. Two methods can be used to do an orderly shutdown. The fastest is  to write a logic 1 to bit 4 in register ALL_LED_OFF_H. The \nother method is to write logic 1 to bit 4 in  each active PWM channel LEDn_OFF_H register.\nPCA9685 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

Normal LEDs can be driven directly in either \nmode. Some newer LEDs include integrated Zener diodes to limit voltage transients, reduce EMI, protect the LEDs and these must be \ndriven only in the open-drain mode to prevent overheating the IC. Power on reset default state of LEDn output pins is LOW. \n[2] Change of the outputs at the STOP command allows synchroniz ing outputs of more than one PCA9685. Applicable to registers from \n06h (LED0_ON_L) to 45h (LED15_OFF_H) only. 1 or more registers can be written, in any order, before STOP.\n[3] Update on ACK requires all 4 PWM channel registers to be loaded before outputs will change on the last ACK.\n[4] See Section 7.4 “ Active LOW output enable input ” for more details.\n7.3.3 LED output and PWM control\nThe turn-on time of each LED driver output and the duty cycl e of PWM can be controlled \nindependently using the LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF registers.\nThere will be two 12-bit registers per LED output. These re gisters will be programmed by \nthe user. Both registers will hold  a value from 0 to 4095. On e 12-bit register will hold a \nvalue for the ON time and the other 12-bit r egister will hold the valu e for the OFF time. The \nON and OFF times are compared  with the value of a 12-bit counter that will be running \ncontinuously from 0000h to 0FFFh (0 to 4095 decimal).\nUpdate on ACK requires all 4 PWM channel registers to be load ed before outputs will \nchange on the last ACK.The ON time, which is  programmable, will be the time the LED output will be asserted and \nthe OFF time, which is also programmable, w ill be the time when the LED output will be \nnegated. In this way, the phase shift becomes completely programmable. The resolution \nfor the phase shift is \n1⁄4096 of the target frequency. Table 7  lists these registers.\nThe following two examples illust rate how to calculate valu es to be loaded into these \nregisters.Table 6.

The LEDn_ON and \nLEDn_OFF count registers should never be programmed with the same values.\nBecause the loading of the LEDn_ON and LEDn_OFF registers is via the I2C-bus, and \nasynchronous to the inte rnal oscillator, we want to ensure  that we do not see any visual \nartifacts of changing the ON and OFF values. This is achieved by updating the changes at \nthe end of the LOW cycle.\n7.3.5 PWM frequency PRE_SCALE\nThe hardware forces a minimum value that can be loaded into the PRE_SCALE register \nat ‘3’. The PRE_SCALE register  defines the frequency at which the outputs modulate. The \nprescale value is determined with the formula shown in Equation 1 :\n(1)\nwhere the update rate is the output modulati on frequency required. For example, for an \noutput default frequency of  200 Hz with an oscillator clock frequency of 25 MHz:\n(2)\nThe maximum PWM frequency is 1526 Hz if the PRE_SCALE register is set "0x03h". \nThe minimum PWM frequency is 24 Hz if the PRE_SCALE register is set "0xFFh". \nThe PRE_SCALE register can only be set when the SLEEP bit of MODE1 register is set to \nlogic 1.Table 8.

This requires an exte rnal clock reference that provides blinking \nperiod and the duty cycle.\nThe OE  pin can also be used as an external dimming control signal. The frequency of the \nexternal clock must be high enough not to be seen by the human eye, and the duty cycle \nvalue determines the brightness of the LEDs.\n7.5 Power-on reset\nWhen power is applied to V DD, an internal power-on reset holds the PCA9685 in a reset \ncondition until V DD has reached V POR. At this point, the reset condition is released and the \nPCA9685 registers and I2C-bus state machine are initia lized to their default states. \nThereafter, V DD must be lowered below 0.2 V to reset the device.Table 11.

To be performed \ncorrectly, it im plies that the I2C-bus is functional and that there is no device hanging the \nbus.\nThe SWRST Call function is defined as the following:\n1. A START command is sent by the I2C-bus master.\n2. The reserved SWRST I2C-bus address ‘0000 000’ with the R/W  bit set to ‘0’ (write) is \nsent by the I2C-bus master. \n3. The PCA9685 device(s) acknowledge(s) after seeing the General Call address \n‘0000 0000’ (00h) only. If the R/W  bit is set to ‘1’ (read), no  acknowledge is returned to \nthe I2C-bus master.\n4. Once the General Call address has been sent and acknowledged, the master sends \n1 byte with 1 specific value (SWRST data byte 1):\na. Byte 1 = 06h: the PCA9685 acknowledges th is value only. If byte 1 is not equal to \n06h, the PCA9685 does not acknowledge it.\nIf more than 1 byte of data is sent, the PCA9685 does not acknowledge any more.\n5. Once the correct byte (SWRST data byte 1) has been sent and correctly \nacknowledged, the master sends a STOP command to end the SWRST Call: the \nPCA9685 then resets to the default value (power-up value) and is ready to be \naddressed again within the specified bus free time (t BUF).\n \nThe I2C-bus master must interpret a non-acknowledge from the PCA9685 (at any time) as \na ‘SWRST Call Abort’. The PCA9685 does not initiate a reset of its registers. This \nhappens only when the format of the SWRST Call sequence is not correct.Fig 12.

Characteristics of the I2C-bus\nThe I2C-bus is for 2-way, 2-line communication between different ICs or modules. The two \nlines are a serial data line (SDA) and a serial clock line (SCL). Both lines must be \nconnected to a positive supply via a pull-up re sistor when connected to the output stages \nof a device. Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.\n8.1 Bit transfer\nOne data bit is transferred during each clock pulse. The data on the SDA line must remain \nstable during the HIGH period of the clock pulse as changes in the data line at this time \nwill be interpreted as control signals (see Figure 16 ).\n \n8.1.1 START and STOP conditions\nBoth data and clock lines remain HIGH when the bus is not busy. A HIGH-to-LOW \ntransition of the data line while the clock is HI GH is defined as the START condition (S). A \nLOW-to-HIGH transition of the data line while the clock is HIGH is defined as the STOP \ncondition (P) (see Figure 17 ).\n \n8.2 System configuration\nA device generating a message is a ‘transmitter ’; a device receiving is the ‘receiver’. The \ndevice that controls the message is the ‘master’ and the devices which are controlled by \nthe master are the ‘slaves’ (see Figure 18 ).Fig 16.

Ea ch byte of eight bits is followed by one \nacknowledge bit. The acknowledge bit is a HIGH level put on the bus by the transmitter, \nwhereas the master generates an extra acknowledge related clock pulse.\nA slave receiver which is addressed must gen erate an acknowledge af ter the reception of \neach byte. Also a master must generate an acknowledge after the reception of each byte \nthat has been clocked out of the slave transm itter. The device that acknowledges has to \npull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse, so that the SDA line is stable \nLOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pulse; set-up time and hold \ntime must be taken into account.\nA master receiver must signal an end of da ta to the transmitter by not generating an \nacknowledge on the last byte that has been cloc ked out of the slave. In this event, the \ntransmitter must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate a STOP \ncondition.\n Fig 18.

The outputs can be configured  as either open-drain NMOS or totem pole \noutputs. If the customer is using the part to directly drive LEDs, they should be using it \nin an open-drain NMOS, if they are concerned about the maximum I SS and ground \nbounce. The edge rate control was designed primarily to slow down the turn-on of the \noutput device; it turns off rather quickly (~1.5 ns). In simulation, the typical turn-on \ntime for the open-drain NMOS was ~14 ns (V DD= 3.6 V; C L=5 0p F ;  R PU=5 0 0\uf057).\nQuestion 2: Is ground bounce possible?\n•Ground bounce is a possibility,  especially if all 16 output s are changed at full current \n(25 mA each). There is a fair amount of decoupling capacitance on chip (~50 pF), which is intended to suppress  some of the groun d bounce. The customer will need to \ndetermine if additional decoupling capacitance externally placed as close as physically possible to the device is required.\nQuestion 3: Can I really sink 400 mA through the single ground pin on the package and \nwill this cause any ground bounce prob lem due to the PWM of the LEDs?\n•Yes, you can sink 400 mA through a single ground pin on the package. Although the package only has one ground pin, there are two ground pads on the die itself \nconnected to this one pin. Al though some ground bounce is likely, it will not disrupt the \noperation of the part and would be reduced by the external decoupling capacitance.\nQuestion 4: I can’t turn the LEDs on or off, but their registers are set properly. Why?\n•Check the MODE1 register SLEEP (bit 4) setting. The bit needs to be 0 in order to \nenable the clocking. If both clock sources (internal osc and EXTCLK) are turned OFF (bit 4 = 1), the LEDs cannot be dimmed or blinked.\nQuestion 5: I’m using LEDs with integrated Zener di odes and the IC is getting very hot. \nWhy?\n•The IC outputs can be set to either open-drain or push-pull and default to push-pull \noutputs. In this application with the Zener diodes, they need to be set to open-drain \nsince in the push-pull architecture there is a low resistance path to GND through the \nZener and this is causing the IC to overheat.\nPCA9685 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

Handling information\nAll input and output pins are protected ag ainst ElectroStatic Discharge (ESD) under \nnormal handling. When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as \ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n17. Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n17.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electr ical circuits. The soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrical connection. Th ere is no single sold ering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n17.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless packages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, in cluding the board finish , solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n17.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nPCA9685 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP Semiconductors N.V. 2015.

It is imperative that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with \nTable 17  and 18\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicat ed on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 38 .Table 17.
