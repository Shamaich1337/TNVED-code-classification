Allow it to dry fully.  \n2. To improve the thermal and RF performance, Qorvo recommends attaching a heat sink to the bottom of the PCB and \napply thermal compound (Arctic Silver 5 recommended or 4 mil indium shim between the heat sink and the package.  \n3. (The following is for information only . There are many variables in a second level assembly that Qorvo does not \ncontrol, so Qorvo does not recommend an absolute torque value.) Use screws to attach the component to the heat \nsink. A suggested torque value is 16 in -oz. for a 0 -80 screw. Start with  screws finger tight, then torque to 8 in -oz., then \ntorque to final value. Use the following tightening pattern.  \n \n4. Apply no -flux solder to each pin of the QPD100 6. The component leads should be manually soldered, and the \npackage cannot be subjected to conv entional reflow processes.
