GENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe W25X 40CL  (4M-bit) Serial Flash memor ies provide s a storage solution for systems with limited \nspace, pins and power. The 25X series offers flexibility and performance well beyond ordinary Serial \nFlash devices. They are ideal for code download applications as well as s toring voice, text and data. \nThe devices operate on a single 2.3V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 1mA \nactive and 1µA for power -down.  All devices are offered in space -saving packages.  \nThe W25X40CL  array s are organized into 2048  programmable pages of 256 -bytes each . Up to 256 \nbytes can be programmed at a time . The W25X40CL  have 128 erasable sectors , 16 erasable 32KB \nblocks  and 8 erasable 64KB blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for greater flexibility in \napplications that require data and parameter storage. (See figure 2.)  \nThe W25X40CL  support  the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), and a high performance dual \noutput as well as Dual I/O SPI : Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data DI (I/O0) , DO (I/O1). SPI cloc k \nfrequencies up to 104MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock  rates of 208MHz when using the \nFast Read Dual Output instruction. These transfer rates are comparable to those of 8 and 16 -bit \nParallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode allows for efficien t memory access with as few \nas 16-clocks of instruction -overhead to read a 24 -bit address, allowing true XIP (execute in place) \noperation.  \nA Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protect, with top or bottom array control \nfeatures, prov ide further control flexibility. Additionally, the device supports JEDEC standard \nmanufacturer and device identification  with a 64 -bit Unique Serial Number.  \n2.

Refer to see figures \n1a and 1b, respectively.  \n6.2 Chip Select ( /CS) \nThe SPI Chip Select ( /CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO , or IO0, IO1 ) pin s are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption will be at standby levels unless an internal erase, \nprogram or write status register cycle is in progress. When /CS is brought low the device will be \nselected, power consu mption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data \nread from the device. After power -up, /CS must transition from high to low before a new instruction will \nbe accepted. The /CS input must track the VCC supply level at power -up (see “ Power -up Timing and \nWrite inhibit threshold ” and Figure 2 6). If needed , a pull -up resister on /CS can be used to accomplish \nthis. \n6.3 Serial Data Input, Output  and IOs  (DI, DO, IO0 and  IO1) \nThe W25X40CL  support s standard SPI and Dual SPI operation.  Standard SPI instructions use the \nunidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising \nedge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to read \ndata or st atus from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the \ndevice on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the de vice on the falling edge of C LK.  \n6.4 Write Protect ( /WP) \nThe Write Protect ( /WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect ( TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 ) bits and St atus Register \nProtect (SRP) bit , a portion or the entire memory array can be hardware protected. The /WP pin is \nactive low.  \n6.5 HOLD  (/HOLD ) \nThe Hold ( /HOLD ) pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD  is \nbrought low, while /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK \npins will be ignored (don’t care). When /HOLD  is brought high, device operation can resume. The  \n/HOLD  function can be useful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals.  \n6.6 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations.  \nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 8 -                                    Revision F \n7.

W25X40CL  Serial Flash Memory Block Diagram  \nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 9 -                                    Revision F \n7.1 SPI OPERATIONS  \n7.1.1  Standard SPI Instructions   \nThe W25X40CL  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock \n(CLK), Chip Select (/CS), Serial Data Input (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI \ninstructions use the DI input pin to serially write instruct ions, addresses or data to the device on the \nrising edge of CLK. The DO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling \nedge CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Modes 0 (0,  0) and 3 (1,  1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 \nand Mode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and \ndata is not being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 the CLK signal is normally low on the \nfalling and rising edges of /CS. For Mode 3 the CLK signal i s normally high on the falling and rising \nedges of /CS . \n7.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25X40CL  support s Dual SPI operation when using the “Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh)” and “Fast \nRead Dual I/O (BBh)” instructions. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the device \nat two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices. The Dual SPI Read instructions are \nideal for quickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for execut ing non-\nspeed -critical  code directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions, the DI and DO \npins become bidirectional I/O pins: IO0 and IO1.  \n7.1.3  Hold Function  \nThe /HOLD  signal allows the W25X40CL  operation to be paused whil e it is actively selected (when \n/CS is low). The  /HOLD  function may be useful in cases where the SPI data and clock signals are \nshared with other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer was only partially written when a \npriority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus. In this case the  /HOLD  function can save the state of the \ninstruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where it left off once the bus is \navailable again.  \nTo initiate a  /HOLD  condition, the device must be sel ected with /CS low. A  /HOLD  condition will \nactivate on the falling edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not \nalready low the  /HOLD  condition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The  /HOLD  condition \nwill termi nate on the rising edge of the  /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not \nalready low the  /HOLD  condition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK.  \nDuring a  /HOLD  condition, the Serial Data Output (DO) is high impedance, and Serial Data Input/  \nOutput ( DI) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip Select ( /CS) signal should be kept active \n(low) for the full duration of the  /HOLD  operation to avoid resetting the internal logic state of the \ndevice.  \nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 10 -                                    Revision F \n7.2 WRITE PROTECTION  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and \nother adverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern , the \nW25X40CL  provide s several means to protect da ta from inadvertent writes.  \n7.2.1  Write Protect Features  \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold.  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up. \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions.  \n\uf0b7 Automatic write disable after program and erase.  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write protection using Status Register.  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down instruction.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down , the W25X40CL  will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below \nthe threshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 2 6). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC \nvoltage exceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled fo r a time delay of \ntPUW. This includes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the \nWrite Status Register instructions. Note that the chip select pin ( /CS) must track the VCC supply level \nat power -up until the VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached. If needed , a pull -up resister on \n/CS can be used to accomplish this.  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable i nstruction must be issued before a Page \nProgram, Sector Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. After \ncompleting a program, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared \nto a write -disable d state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting \nthe Status Register Protect (SRP) and Block Protect (TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 ) bits. These allow a \nportion small as 4KB sector or the enti re memory array to be configured as read only. Used in \nconjunction with the Write Protect ( /WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or \ndisabled under hardware control. See Status Register for further information.  Additionally, the Power -\ndown  instruction offers an extra level of write protection as all instructions are ignored except for the \nRelease Power -down instruction.  \nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 11 -                                    Revision F \n8. CONTROL AND STATUS R EGISTERS  \nThe Read Status Register instruction can be used to provide status on the availability of th e Flash \nmemory array, if the device is write enabled or disabled, and the state of write protection. The Write \nStatus Register instruction can be used to configure the device  write protection features.  \n8.1 STATUS REGISTER  \n8.1.1  BUSY  \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is executing \na Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction. During \nthis time the device will ignore further instruct ions except for the Read Status Register instruction (see \ntW, tPP, tSE, tBE, and t CE in AC Characteristics). When the program, erase or write status register \ninstruction has completed, the BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state indicating the device is ready for \nfurther instructions.  \n \n8.1.2  Write Enable Latch (WEL)  \nWrite Enable Latch (WEL) is a read only bit in the status register (S1) that is set to a 1 after executing \na Write Enable Instruction. The WEL status bit is cleared to a 0 when the device is write disabled. A \nwrite disable state occurs upon power -up or af ter any of the following instructions  finished : Write \nDisable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and Write Status Register.  \n \n8.1.3  Block Protect Bits ( BP2, BP1, BP0)  \nThe Block Protect Bits ( BP2, BP1 and BP0) are non -volatile read/write bits in the status register ( S4, \nS3, and S2 ) that provide Write Protection control and status. Block Protect bits can be set using the \nWrite Status Register Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory \narray can be protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection \ntable). The factory default setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protec ted. The \nBlock Protect bits cannot  be written to if the Status Register Protect (SRP) bit is set to 1 and the Write \nProtect ( /WP) pin is low.  \n \n8.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect (TB)  \nThe Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block P rotect Bits ( BP2, BP1 and BP0) protect from the Top \n(TB=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection table. \nThe TB bit is non -volatile and the factory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write \nStatus Register Instruction provided that the Write Enable instruction has been issued. The TB bit \ncannot  be written to if the Status Register Protect (SRP) bit is set to 1 and the Write Protect (/WP)  pin \nis low.  \n  \nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 12 -                                    Revision F \n8.1.5  Reserved Bits  \nStatus register bit location S6 is reserved for future use. Current devices will read 0 for this bit location. \nIt is recommended to mask out the reserved bit when testing the Status Register. Doing this will \nensure compatibility with future devices.  \n8.1.6  Status  Register Protect (SRP)  \nThe Status Register Protect (SRP) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in status register (S7) that can be \nused in conjunction with the Write Protect ( /WP) pin to disable writes to status register . When the SRP \nbit is set to a 0 state (factory default) the /WP pin has no control over status register. When the SRP \npin is set to a 1, the Write Status Register instruction is locked out while the /WP pin is low. When the \n/WP pin is high the Write Statu s Register instruction is allowed.  \nSRP /WP Status \nRegister  Description  \n0 X Software \nProtection  /WP pin has no control, The Status register can be written  to \nafter a Write Enable instruction WEL = 1.

Instructions are initiated w ith the falling edge of Chip \nSelect (/CS) . The first b yte of data clocked into the DI  input provides the instruction code. Data on th e \nDI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, \ndata bytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are completed \nwith the rising edge of edge  /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction ar e included in \nfigures 4 through 25. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all \ninstructions that Write, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary (CS driven high after a \nfull 8 -bits have been clocked) otherwise the i nstruction will be terminated. This feature further protects \nthe device from inadvertent writes. Additionally, while the memory is being programmed or erased, or \nwhen the Status Register is being written, all instructions except for Read Status Register wi ll be \nignored until the program or erase cycle has completed.  \n8.2.1  Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (M7-M0)  \nWinbond Serial Flash  EFh \n \nDevice ID  (ID7-ID0) (ID15 -ID0) \nInstruction   ABh, 90h , 92h  9Fh \nW25X 40CL 12h 3013h \n \n  \nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 15 -                                    Revision F \n8.2.2  Instruction Set (1) \nINSTRUCTION \nNAME  BYTE 1 \n(CODE ) BYTE 2  BYTE 3  BYTE 4  BYTE 5  BYTE 6  N-BYTES  \nWrite Enable  06h       \nWrite Enable for  \nVolatile Status \nRegister  50h       \nWrite Disable  04h       \nRead Status Register  05h (S7–S0)(1)     (2) \nWrite Status Register  01h S7–S0      \nRead Data  03h A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0 (D7–D0) (Next byte)  continuous  \nFast Read  0Bh A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0 dummy  (D7–D0) (Next Byte) \ncontinuous  \nFast Read Dual \nOutput  3Bh A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0 dummy  (D7-D0, …)(5) (one byte per \n4 clocks, \ncontinuous)  \nFast Read Dual I/O  BBh A23-A8(6) A7-A0, M7 -\nM0(6) (D7-D0, …)(5)    \nPage Program  02h A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0 (D7–D0) (Next byte)  Up to 256 \nbytes  \nSector Erase (4KB)  20h A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0    \nBlock Erase (32KB)  52h A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0    \nBlock Erase ( 64KB) D8h A23–A16 A15–A8 A7–A0    \nChip Erase  C7h/60h        \nPower -down  B9h       \nRelease Power -down \n/ Device ID  ABh dummy  dummy  dummy  (ID7-ID0)(4)   \nManufacturer/  \nDevice ID (3) 90h dummy  dummy  00h (M7-M0) (ID7-ID0)  \nManufacturer/Device  \nID by Dual I/O  92h A23-A8 A7-A0, \nM[7:0]  (MF[7:0], \nID[7:0])     \nJEDEC ID  9Fh (M7-M0) \nManufacturer  (ID15 -ID8) \nMemory \nType  (ID7-ID0) \nCapacity     \nRead Unique ID  4Bh dummy  dummy  dummy  dummy  (ID63 -ID0) Read Unique \nID \nNotes:  \n1 Data bytes are shifted with Most Significant Bit first.

The WEL bit must be set prior to every Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase , Chip Erase \nand Write Status Register instruction. The Write Enable instruction is entered by driving /CS low, \nshifting the instruction code “0 6h” into the Data Input (DI) pin on the rising edge of CLK, and then \ndriving /CS high.  \n \nFigure 4. Write Enable Instruction Sequence Diagram  \n8.2.4  Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h)  \nThe non -volatile Status Register bits described in section 7.1 can also be written to as volatile bits. \nThis gives more flexibility to change the system configuration and memory protection schemes quickly \nwithout waiting for the typical non -volatile bit wr ite cycles or affecting the endurance of the Status \nRegister non -volatile bits. To write the volatile values into the Status Register bits, the Write Enable for \nVolatile Status Register (50h) instruction must be issued prior to a Write Status Register (01h ) \ninstruction. Write Enable for Volatile Status Register instruction (Figure 5) will not set the Write Enable \nLatch (WEL) bit, it is only valid for the Write Status Register instruction to change the volatile Status \nRegister bit values.  \n \n \nFigure 5.

The Write Disable instruction is entered by driving  /CS low, shifting the instruction code “0 4h” \ninto the DI  pin and then driving /CS high.  WEL bit is automa tically reset after Power -up and upon \ncompletion of the Write Status Register,  Page Program , Sector Erase, Block Erase and Chip Erase \ninstructions.  Write Disable instruction can also be used to invalidate the Write Enable for Volatile \nStatus Register instr uction \n \nFigure 6. Write Disable Instruction Sequence Diagram  \n8.2.6  Read Status Register (05h)  \nThe Read Status Register instruction allows the 8 -bit Status Register to be read. The instruction is \nentered by driving /CS low and shifting the instruction code “05h” into the DI pin on the rising edge of \nCLK. The status register bits are then shifted out  on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most \nsignificant bit (MSB) first as shown in figure 6. The Status Register bits are shown in figure 3 and \ninclude the BUSY, WEL, BP2, BP1, BP0, TB and SRP bits (see description of the Status Register \nearlier in this datasheet ).  \nThe Status Register instruction may be used at any time, even while a Program, Erase or Write Status \nRegister cycle is in progress. This allows the BUSY status bit to be  checked to determine when the \ncycle is complete and if the device can accept another instruction. The Status Register can be read \ncontinuously, as shown in Figure 7. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. \n \nFigure 7.

A Write Enable \ninstruction must previously have been executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered by \ndriving /CS low, sending the instruction code “01h”, and then writing the status register data  byte as \nillustrated in figure 8. The Status Register bits are shown in figure 3 and described earlier in this \ndatasheet .  \nOnly non -volatile Status Register bits SRP, TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0 (bits 7, 5, 4, 3 and 2) can be \nwritten to. All other Status Register bit locations are read -only and will not be affected by the Write \nStatus Register instruction.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not \ndone the Write Status Register instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed \nWrite Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See A C Characteristics). While \nthe Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may still accessed \nto check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Write Status Register cycle and a \n0 when the cycle is fini shed and ready to accept other instructions again. After the Write Register \ncycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be cleared to 0.  \nThe Write Status Register instruction allows the Block Protect bits (TB, BP2, BP1 and BP0) to be set \nfor protecting all, a portion, or none of the memory from erase and program instructions. Protected \nareas become read -only (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The Write Status Register \ninstruction also allows the Status Regist er Protect bit (SRP) to be set. This bit is used in conjunction \nwith the Write Protect ( /WP) pin to disable writes to the status register. When the SRP bit is set to a 0 \nstate (factory default) the /WP pin has no control over the status register. When the SRP pin is set to a \n1, the Write Status Register instruction is locked out while the /WP pin is low. When the /WP pin is \nhigh the Write Status Register instruction is allowed.  \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h), after / CS is driven high, the \nStatus Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nCharacteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period . \n \n \nFigure 8.

The code and address bits are latched on t he \nrising edge of the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory \nlocation will be shifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. \nThe address is automatically incremented to the  next higher address after each byte of data is shifted \nout allowing for a continuous stream of data. This means that the entire memory can be accessed with \na single instruction as long as the clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. \nThe Read Data instruction sequence is shown in figure 9. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle. The Read Data ins truction allows clock rates from D.C. to a maximum of \nfR (see AC Electrical Characteristics). \n \nFigure 9.

This is accomplished by adding \neight “dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in figure 10. The dummy clocks allow the \ndevices internal circuits  additional time for setting up the initial address. During the dummy clocks the \ndata value on the DI pin is a “don’t care”.  \n \nFigure 10.

This allows data to be transferred from the \nW25X40CL  at twice the rate of standard SPI devices. The Fast Read Dual Output instruction is ideal \nfor quickly downloading code from Flash to RAM upon power -up or for applications that cache code -\nsegments to RA M for execution.  \nSimilar to the Fast Read instruction, the Fast Read Dual Output instruction can operate at the highest \npossible frequency of F R (see AC Electrical Characteristics). This is accomplished by adding eight \n“dummy” clocks after the 24 -bit address as shown in figure 1 1. The dummy clocks allow the device ’s \ninternal circuits additional time for setting up the initial address. The input da ta during the dummy \nclocks is “don’t care”. However, the IO0 pin should be high -impedance prior to the falling edge of the \nfirst data out clock.  \n \nFigure 1 1.

It is similar to the Fast Read Dual Output (3Bh) instruction but with the capability to \ninput the Address bits (A23 -0) two bits per clock. This reduced instruction overhead may allow for \ncode execution (XIP) directly from the D ual SPI in some applications.  \nFast Read Dual I/O with “Continuous Read Mode”  \nThe Fast Read Dual I/O instruction can further reduce instruction overhead through setting the \n“Continuous Read Mode” bits (M7 -0) after the input Address bits (A23 -0), as shown in figure 1 2a. The \nupper nibble  of the (M7 -4) controls the length of the next Fast Read Dual I/O instruction through the \ninclusion or exclusion of the first byte instruction code. The lower nibble bits of the (M3 -0) are don’t \ncare (“x”). However, the IO pins should be high -impedance pri or to the falling edge of the first data out \nclock.  \nIf the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 = (1,0), then the next Fast Read Dual I/O  instruction (after \n/CS is raised and then lowered) does not require the BBh instruction code,  as shown in figure 1 2b. \nThis reduces the instruction sequence by eight clocks and allows the Read address to be immediately \nentered after /CS is asserted low. If the “Continuous Read Mode ” bits M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the \nnext instruction (after /CS is raised and then lowered) requires the first byte instruction code, thus \nreturning to normal operation. A “Continuous Read Mode” Reset instruction can also be used to reset \n(M7-0) before iss uing normal instructions (See 9 .2.12 for detail descriptions).  \n \nFigure 1 2a.

M5-4 are used to control whether the 8 -bit SPI \ninstruction code BBh is needed or not for the next command. When M5 -4 = (1,0), the next command \nwill be treated same as the current Dual I/O Read command without needing the 8 -bit instruction code; \nwhen M5 -4 do not equal to (1,0), the device returns to normal SPI mode, all commands can be \naccepted. M7 -6 and M3 -0 are reserved bits for future use, either 0 or 1 values can be used.  \n8.2.13  Continuous Read Mode Reset ( FFFFh)  \nContinuous Read Mode Reset instruction can be used to set M4 = 1, thus the device will release the \nContinuous Read Mode and return to normal SPI operation, as shown in figure 1 3. \n \n \nFigure 1 3. Continuous Read Mo de Reset for Fast Read Dual  I/O \nSince W25X40CL  does not have a  hardware  Reset pin, so if the controller resets while W25X40CL  is  \nset to Continuous Mode Read, the  W25X40CL  will not recognize any initial standard SPI instructions \nfrom the controller. To address this possibility,  it is recommended to  issue a Continuous Read Mode \nReset instruction as the first instruction after a system Reset. Doing so will release the device from  the \nContinuous Read Mode and allow Standard SPI instructions to be recognized.  \nTo reset “Continuous Read Mode” during Dual I/O operation, sixteen clocks are needed to shift in \ninstruction “FFFFh”.  \n  \n110 2/CS\nMode 0Mode 34 6 8 10 12\nMode 0Mode 3\nCLK\nIO0\nIOMode Bit Reset \nfor Dual I/O\nDon’t CareFFFFh/CS\nMode 0Mode 3\nCLK\nIO0\nIODon’t Care1 3 5 7 9 11 13 14 15\nW25X 40CL  \n \nPublication Release Date:  March 25, 2014  \n     - 25 -                                    Revision F \n8.2.14  Page Program (02h)   \nThe Pa ge Program instruction allows  from one byte  to 256 bytes  (a page)  of data to be programmed \nat previously erased  (FFh)  memory locations. A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the \ndevice will accept the Page Program Instruct ion (Sta tus Register bit WEL  = 1). The instruction is \ninitiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h” followed by a 24 -bit address \n(A23 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the DI pin. The  /CS pin must be held low for the entire length \nof the instruction while data is being sent to the device.  \nIf an entire 256 byte page is to be programmed, the last address byte (the 8 least significant address \nbits) should be set to 0. If the last address byte  is not zero, and the number of clocks exceed s the \nremaining page length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In some cases, less \nthan 256 bytes (a partial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the \nsame page. One condition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks cannot  \nexceed the remaining page length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will \nwrap to the beginning of the page and overwrite previously sent da ta. \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last \nbyte has been latched. If this is not done the Page Program instruction will not be executed. After /CS \nis driven high, the self -timed Page Progr am instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See \nAC Characteristics). While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register \ninstruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during \nthe Page Program cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept \nother instructions again. After the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit \nin the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Page Program instruction will not be executed if the \naddressed page is protected by the Block Protect ( BP2, BP1, and BP0 ) bits  (see Status Register \nMemory Protection table) . \n \nFigure 14.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Sector \nErase Instruction ( Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS \npin low and shifting the instruction code “20h” followed a 24 -bit sector address (A23 -A0) (see Figure \n2). The Sector Erase instruction sequence is shown in figure 1 5. \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC \nCharacteristics). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code \n“B9h” as shown in figure 1 9.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done th e Power -\ndown instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered \nwithin the time duration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down state only the \nRelease from Power -down / Device ID instruction, whi ch restores the device to normal operation, will \nbe recognized. All other instructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, \nwhich is always available during normal operation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power \nDown  state a useful condition for securing maximum write protection.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state, obtain the devices electronic identification (ID) number \nor do both.  \nTo release the devic e from the power -down state, the instruction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the instruction code “A Bh” and driving /CS high as shown in figure 20. Release from power -\ndown will take the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume \nnormal operation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 \ntime duration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is initiated \nby driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “A Bh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The \nDevice ID bits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first as \nshown in figure 20. The Device ID values for the W25X40CL  are listed in Manufacturer and Device \nIdentification table. The Device ID can be read continuously. The instruction is completed by driving \n/CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the instruction \nis the same as previously described, and shown in figure 21, except that after /CS is driven high it \nmust remain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the \ndevice will resume normal operation and other instructions will be accepted.  \nIf the Release from Power -down / Device ID instruction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write \ncycle is in process (when BUSY equals 1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effects on \nthe current cycle \n \nFigure 20.

The \nJEDEC assigned Manufacturer ID byte for Winbond (E Fh) and two Device ID bytes, Memory Type \n(ID15 -ID8) an d Capacity (ID7 -ID0) are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant \nbit (MSB) first as shown in figure 25. For memory type and capacity values refer to Manufacturer and \nDevice Identification table. \n \nFigure 25.
