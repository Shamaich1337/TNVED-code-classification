The device is capable of supplying 250mA of \noutput current with a dropout voltage of 400mV. Designed \nfor use in battery-powered or high voltage systems, the low \nquiescent current (40µA operating and 1µA in shutdown) \nmakes the L T3012 an ideal choice. Quiescent current is \nalso well controlled in dropout.\nOther features of the L T3012 include the ability to operate \nwith very small output capacitors. The regulator is stable \nwith only 3.3µF on the output while most older devices \nrequire between 10µF and 100µF for stability. Small ce -\nramic capacitors can be used without any need for series \nresistance (ESR) as is common with other regulators. \nInternal protection circuitry includes reverse-battery \nprotection, current limiting, thermal limiting and reverse \ncurrent protection. \nThe device is available with an adjustable output with a \n1.24V reference voltage. The L T3012 regulator is available \nin the 16-lead TSSOP and 12 pin low profile (0.75mm) \n(4mm × 3mm) DFN packages with an exposed pad for \nenhanced thermal handling capability.\nDropout Voltagen Wide Input Voltage Range: 4V to 80V\nn Low Quiescent Current: 40µA\nn Low Dropout Voltage: 400mV\nn Output Current: 250mA\nn No Protection Diodes Needed\nn Adjustable Output from 1.24V to 60V\nn 1µA Quiescent Current in Shutdown\nn Stable with 3.3µF Output Capacitor\nn Stable with Aluminum, Tantalum or Ceramic \nCapacitors\nn Reverse-Battery Protection\nn No Reverse Current Flow from Output to Input\nn Thermal Limiting\nn Thermally Enhanced 16-Lead TSSOP and \n 12-Pin (4mm × 3mm) DFN Packages\nn AEC-Q100 Qualified for Automotive Application\nn Low Current High Voltage Regulators\nn Regulator for Battery-Powered Systems\nn Telecom Applications\nn Automotive Applications\n5V Supply with ShutdownTYPICAL APPLICATIONAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. \n1µFVIN\n5.4V TO\n80V\n3012 TA01VOUT\n5V\n250mA\nVSHDN\n<0.3V\n>2.0VOUTPUT\nOFF\nON3.3µF750k\n249kIN\nL T3012\nSHDNOUT\nADJ\nGND\nOUTPUT CURRENT (mA)0250300400\n350\n200\n3012 TA02200\n150\n50 100 150 250100\n50\n0DROPOUT VOL TAGE (mV)\nDocument Feedback\nLT30122\nRev.

Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2:  The L T3012 is tested and specified for these conditions with the \nADJ pin connected to the OUT pin.\nNote 3:  Operating conditions are limited by maximum junction \ntemperature. The regulated output voltage specification will not apply \nfor all possible combinations of input voltage and output current. When \noperating at maximum input voltage, the output current range must be \nlimited. When operating at maximum output current, the input voltage \nrange must be limited.\nNote 4:  To satisfy requirements for minimum input voltage, the L T3012 \nis tested and specified for these conditions with an external resistor \ndivider (249k bottom, 649k top) for an output voltage of 4.5V . The external \nresistor divider will add a 5µA DC load on the output.\nNote 5:  Dropout voltage is the minimum input to output voltage differential \nneeded to maintain regulation at a specified output current. In dropout, the \noutput voltage will be equal to (V IN – V DROPOUT ).\nNote 6:  GND pin current is tested with V IN = 4.75V and a current source \nload. This means the device is tested while operating close to its dropout \nregion. This is the worst-case GND pin current. The GND pin current will \ndecrease slightly at higher input voltages.Note 7:  ADJ pin bias current flows into the ADJ pin.\nNote 8:  SHDN  pin current flows out of the SHDN  pin.\nNote 9:  Reverse output current is tested with the IN pin grounded and the \nOUT pin forced to the rated output voltage. This current flows into the OUT \npin and out the GND pin.\nNote 10:  The L T3012E is guaranteed to meet performance specifications \nfrom 0°C to 125°C operating junction temperature. Specifications over \nthe –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range are assured by \ndesign, characterization and correlation with statistical process controls. \nThe L T3012H is tested to the L T3012H Electrical Characteristics table at \n140°C operating junction temperature. High junction temperatures degrade \noperating lifetimes. Operating lifetime is derated at junction temperatures \ngreater than 125°C. \nNote 11:  This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction \ntemperature will exceed 125°C (L T3012E) or 140°C (L T3012H) when \novertemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above the \nspecified maximum operating junction temperature may impair device \nreliability.\nNote 12:  For automotive products (L T3012EDE#WPBF and \nL T3012EDE#WTRPBF), the OUT Pin voltage is limited to ±60V for \ntransients 1s or less and ±50V for continuous operation.\nLT30125\nRev.

These pins have no internal connection; connecting \nNC pins to a copper area for heat dissipation provides a \nsmall improvement in thermal performance. \nOUT (Pins 2, 3)/(Pins 3, 4):  Output.The output supplies \npower to the load. A minimum output capacitor of 3.3µF is \nrequired to prevent oscillations. Larger output capacitors \nwill be required for applications with large transient loads \nto limit peak voltage transients. See the Applications Infor -\nmation section for more information on output capacitance \nand reverse output characteristics.\nADJ (Pin 4)/(Pin 5):  Adjust. This is the input to the error \namplifier . This pin is internally clamped to ±7V. It has a bias \ncurrent of 30nA which flows into the pin (see curve of ADJ \nPin Bias Current vs Temperature in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics). The ADJ pin voltage is 1.24V referenced \nto ground, and the output voltage range is 1.24V to 60V.\nGND (Pins 5, 13)/(Pins 1, 6, 8, 9, 16, 17):  Ground. The \nexposed backside of the package is an electrical connection \nfor GND. As such, to ensure optimum device operation and \nthermal performance, the exposed pad must be connected \ndirectly to pin 5/pin 6 on the PC board.SHDN  (Pin 8)/(Pin 11):  Shutdown. The SHDN  pin is used \nto put the L T3012 into a low power shutdown state. The \noutput will be off when the SHDN  pin is pulled low. The \nSHDN  pin can be driven either by 5V logic or open-collector \nlogic with a pull-up resistor. The pull-up resistor is only \nrequired to supply the pull-up current of the open-collector \ngate, normally several microamperes. If unused, the SHDN  \npin must be tied to a logic high or to V IN.\nIN (Pins 10, 11)/(Pins 13,14):  Input. Power is supplied \nto the device through the IN pin. A bypass capacitor is \nrequired on this pin if the device is more than six inches \naway from the main input filter capacitor. In general, the \noutput impedance of a battery rises with frequency, so it is \nadvisable to include a bypass capacitor in battery-powered \ncircuits. A bypass capacitor in the range of 1µF to 10µF is \nsufficient. The L T3012 is designed to withstand reverse \nvoltages on the IN pin with respect to ground and the OUT \npin. In the case of a reversed input, which can happen if \na battery is plugged in backwards, the L T3012 will act as \nif there is a diode in series with its input. There will be \nno reverse current flow into the L T3012 and no reverse \nvoltage will appear at the load. The device will protect both \nitself and the load.(DFN Package/TSSOP Package)\nThe L T3012 is a 250mA high voltage low dropout regulator \nwith micropower quiescent current and shutdown. The de -\nvice is capable of supplying 250mA at a dropout voltage of \n400mV. The low operating quiescent current (40µA) drops \nto 1µA in shutdown. In addition to the low quiescent current, \nthe L T3012 incorporates several protection features which \nmake it ideal for use in battery-powered systems. The \ndevice is protected against both reverse input and reverse \noutput voltages. In battery backup applications where the \noutput can be held up by a backup battery when the input \nis pulled to ground, the L T3012 acts like it has a diode in \nseries with its output and prevents reverse current flow.Adjustable Operation\nThe L T3012 has an output voltage range of 1.24V to 60V. \nThe output voltage is set by the ratio of two external resis -\ntors as shown in Figure 1. The device servos the output to \nmaintain the voltage at the adjust pin at 1.24V referenced \nto ground. The current in R1 is then equal to 1.24V/R1 \nand the current in R2 is the current in R1 plus the ADJ \npin bias current. The ADJ pin bias current, 30nA at 25°C, \nflows through R2 into the ADJ pin. The output voltage \ncan be calculated using the formula in Figure\xa01 . The value \nof R1 should be less than 250k to minimize errors in the \noutput voltage caused by the ADJ pin bias current. Note \nthat in shutdown the output is turned off and the divider \ncurrent will be zero. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT30129\nRev. F For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe adjustable device is tested and specified with the \nADJ pin tied to the OUT pin and a 5µA DC load (unless \notherwise specified) for an output voltage of 1.24V. Spec -\nifications for output voltages greater than 1.24V will be \nproportional to the ratio of the desired output voltage to \n1.24V; (V OUT/1.24V). For example, load regulation for an \noutput current change of 1mA to 250mA is –7mV typical at  \nVOUT = 1.24V. At V OUT = 12V, load regulation is:\n (12V/1.24V) • (–7mV) = –68mV\nOutput Capacitance and T ransient Response\nThe L T3012 is designed to be stable with a wide range of \noutput capacitors. The ESR of the output capacitor affects \nstability, most notably with small capacitors. A minimum \noutput capacitor of 3.3µF with an ESR of 3Ω or less is \nrecommended to prevent oscillations. The L T3012 is a \nmicropower device and output transient response will be \na function of output capacitance. Larger values of output \ncapacitance decrease the peak deviations and provide Figure\xa01. Adjustable Operationimproved transient response for larger load current \nchanges. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple individual \ncomponents powered by the L T3012, will increase the \neffective output capacitor value.\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across \ntemperature and applied voltage. The most common \ndielectrics used are specified with EIA temperature char -\nacteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V, X5R and X7R. The Z5U and \nY5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances \nin a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage \nand temperature coefficients as shown in Figures 2 and 3. \nWhen used with a 5V regulator, a 16V 10µF Y5V capacitor \ncan exhibit an effective value as low as 1µF to 2µF for the \nDC bias voltage applied and over the operating temperature \nrange. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in more stable \ncharacteristics and are more suitable for use as the output \ncapacitor. The X7R type has better stability across tem -\nperature, while the X5R is less expensive and is available in \nhigher values. Care still must be exercised when using X5R \nand X7R capacitors; the X5R and X7R codes only specify \noperating temperature range and maximum capacitance \nchange over temperature. Capacitance change due to DC \nbias with X5R and X7R capacitors is better than Y5V and \nZ5U capacitors, but can still be significant enough to drop \ncapacitor values below appropriate levels. Capacitor DC \nbias characteristics tend to improve as component case \nsize increases, but expected capacitance at operating \nvoltage should be verified.\nFigure\xa02.

F For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, \nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric accelerometer or micro -\nphone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can be \ninduced by vibrations in the system or thermal transients.\nCurrent Limit and Safe Operating Area Protection\nLike many IC power regulators, the L T3012 has safe oper -\nating area protection. The safe operating area protection \ndecreases the current limit as the input voltage increases \nand keeps the power transistor in a safe operating region. \nThe protection is designed to provide some output current \nat all values of input voltage up to the device breakdown \n(see curve of Current Limit vs Input Voltage in the Typical \nPerformance Characteristics).\nThe L T3012 is limited for operating conditions by maximum \njunction temperature. While operating at maximum input \nvoltage, the output current range must be limited; when \noperating at maximum output current, the input voltage \nrange must be limited. Device specifications will not apply \nfor all possible combinations of input voltage and output \ncurrent. Operating the L T3012 beyond the maximum junc -\ntion temperature rating may impair the life of the device.\nThermal Considerations\nThe power handling capability of the device will be limited \nby the maximum rated junction temperature of (125°C for \nL T3012E, or 140°C for L T3012HFE). The power dissipated \nby the device will be made up of two components:\n1. Output current multiplied by the input/output voltage   \n differential: I OUT • (V IN – V OUT) and,\n2. GND pin current multiplied by the input voltage:  \n IGND • VIN.\nThe GND pin current can be found by examining the GND \nPin Current curves in the Typical Performance Character -\nistics. Power dissipation will be equal to the sum of the \ntwo components listed above.\nThe L T3012 has internal thermal limiting designed to pro -\ntect the device during overload conditions. For continuous normal conditions the maximum junction temperature \nrating of 125°C (E-Grade) or 140°C (H-Grade)must not \nbe exceeded. It is important to give careful consideration \nto all sources of thermal resistance from junction to \nambient. Additional heat sources mounted nearby must \nalso be considered.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Copper board stiffeners and plated \nthrough-holes can also be used to spread the heat gen -\nerated by power devices.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent board sizes and copper areas. All measurements \nwere taken in still air on 3/32" FR-4 board with one ounce \ncopper.\nTable 1.

T ransient operation at high input/\noutput differentials is possible. The approximate thermal \ntime constant for a 2500sq mm 3/32" FR-4 board with \nmaximum topside and backside area for one ounce copper \nis 3 seconds. This time constant will increase as more \nthermal mass is added (i.e., vias, larger board, and other \ncomponents).\nLT301211\nRev. F For more information www.analog.comFor an application with transient high power peaks, average \npower dissipation can be used for junction temperature \ncalculations as long as the pulse period is significantly less \nthan the thermal time constant of the device and board.\nCalculating Junction Temperature\nExample 1: Given an output voltage of 5V, an input voltage \nrange of 24V to 30V, an output current range of 0mA to \n50mA, and a maximum ambient temperature of 50°C, what \nwill the maximum junction temperature be?\nThe power dissipated by the device will be equal to:\n IOUT(MAX)  • (V IN(MAX)  – V OUT) + (I GND • VIN(MAX) )\nwhere:\n IOUT(MAX)  = 50mA\n V IN(MAX)  = 30V\n IGND at (I OUT = 50mA, V IN = 30V) = 1mA\nSo:\n P = 50mA • (30V – 5V) + (1mA • 30V) = 1.28W\nThe thermal resistance will be in the range of 40°C/W to \n62°C/W depending on the copper area. So the junction \ntemperature rise above ambient will be approximately \nequal to:\n 1.31W • 50°C/W = 65.5°C\nThe maximum junction temperature will then be equal to \nthe maximum junction temperature rise above ambient \nplus the maximum ambient temperature or:\n T JMAX = 50°C + 65.5°C = 115.5°C\nExample 2: Given an output voltage of 5V , an input voltage \nof 48V that rises to 72V for 5ms(max) out of every 100ms, \nand a 5mA load that steps to 50mA for 50ms out of every \n250ms, what is the junction temperature rise above ambi -\nent? Using a 500ms period (well under the time constant \nof the board), power dissipation is as follows:\n P1(48V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (48V – 5V)  \n  + (200µA • 48V) = 0.23W\n P2(48V in, 50mA load) = 50mA • (48V – 5V)  \n  + (1mA • 48V) = 2.20WAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\n P3(72V in, 5mA load) = 5mA • (72V – 5V)  \n  + (200µA • 72V) = 0.35W\n P4(72V in, 50mA load) = 50mA • (72V – 5V)  \n  + (1mA • 72V) = 3.42W\nOperation at the different power levels is as follows:\n 76% operation at P1, 19% for P2, 4% for P3, and   \n 1% for P4.\n P EFF = 76%(0.23W) + 19%(2.20W) + 4%(0.35W)  \n  + 1%(3.42W) = 0.64W\nWith a thermal resistance in the range of 40°C/W to  \n62°C/W , this translates to a junction temperature rise \nabove ambient of 26°C to 38°C.\nHigh Temperature Operation\nCare must be taken when designing L T3012 applications to \noperate at high ambient temperatures. The L T3012 works \nat elevated temperatures but erratic operation can occur \ndue to unforeseen variations in external components. Some \ntantalum capacitors are available for high temperature \noperation, but ESR is often several ohms; capacitor ESR \nabove 3Ω is unsuitable for use with the L T3012. Ceramic \ncapacitor manufacturers (Murata, AVX, TDK, and Vishay \nVitramon at this writing) now offer ceramic capacitors that \nare rated to 150°C using an X8R dielectric. Device instability \nwill occur if output capacitor value and ESR are outside \ndesign limits at elevated temperature and operating DC \nvoltage bias (see information on capacitor characteristics \nunder Output Capacitance and T ransient Response). Check \neach passive component for absolute value and voltage \nratings over the operating temperature range.\nLeakages in capacitors or from solder flux left after  \ninsuficient board cleaning adversely affects low  \nquiescent current operation.  The output voltage resistor \ndivider should use a maximum bottom resistor value of \n124k to compensate for high temperature leakage, setting \ndivider current to 10µA. Consider junction temperature \nincrease due to power dissipation in both the junction and \nnearby components to ensure maximum specifications \nare not violated for the device or external components.\nLT301212\nRev. F For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nProtection Features\nThe L T3012 incorporates several protection features \nwhich make it ideal for use in battery-powered circuits. \nIn addition to the normal protection features associated \nwith monolithic regulators, such as current limiting and \nthermal limiting, the device is protected against reverse-in -\nput voltages, and reverse voltages from output to input.\nLike many IC power regulators, the L T3012 has safe oper -\nating area protection. The safe area protection decreases \nthe current limit as input voltage increases and keeps the \npower transistor inside a safe operating region for all values \nof input voltage. The protection is designed to provide some \noutput current at all values of input voltage up to the device \nbreakdown. The SOA protection circuitry for the L T3012 \nuses a current generated when the input voltage exceeds \n25V to decrease current limit. This  current shows up as \nadditional quiescent current for input voltages above 25V . \nThis increase in quiescent current occurs both in normal \noperation and in shutdown (see curve of Quiescent Current \nin the Typical Performance Characteristics).\nCurrent limit protection and thermal overload protection \nare intended to protect the device against current overload \nconditions at the output of the device. For normal opera -\ntion, the junction temperature should not exceed 125°C \n(L T3012E) or 140°C (L T3012HFE).\nThe input of the device will withstand reverse voltages of \n80V. No negative voltage will appear at the output. The \ndevice will protect both itself and the load. This provides \nprotection against batteries which can be plugged in \nbackward.\nThe ADJ pin of the device can be pulled above or below \nground by as much as 7V without damaging the device. \nIf the input is left open circuit or grounded, the ADJ pin \nwill act like an open circuit when pulled below ground, \nand like a large resistor (typically 100k) in series with a \ndiode when pulled above ground. If the input is powered \nby a voltage source, pulling the ADJ pin below the refer -\nence voltage will cause the device to current limit. This \nwill cause the output to go to a unregulated high voltage. \nPulling the ADJ pin above the reference voltage will turn \noff all output current. In situations where the ADJ pin is connected to a resistor \ndivider that would pull the ADJ pin above its 7V clamp \nvoltage if the output is pulled high, the ADJ pin input \ncurrent must be limited to less than 5mA. For example, a \nresistor divider is used to provide a regulated 1.5V output \nfrom the 1.24V reference when the output is forced to 60V. \nThe top resistor of the resistor divider must be chosen to \nlimit the current into the ADJ pin to less than 5mA when \nthe ADJ pin is at 7V. The 53V difference between the OUT \nand ADJ pins divided by the 5mA maximum current into \nthe ADJ pin yields a minimum top resistor value of 10.6k.\nIn circuits where a backup battery is required, several \ndifferent input/output conditions can occur. The output \nvoltage may be held up while the input is either pulled \nto ground, pulled to some intermediate voltage, or is left \nopen circuit. Current flow back into the output will follow \nthe curve shown in Figure 4. The rise in reverse output \ncurrent above 7V occurs from the breakdown of the 7V \nclamp on the ADJ pin. With a resistor divider on the reg -\nulator output, this current will be reduced depending on \nthe size of the resistor divider.\nFigure 4. Reverse Output Current\nWhen the IN pin of the L T3012 is forced below the OUT \npin or the OUT pin is pulled above the IN pin, input cur -\nrent will typically drop to less than 2µA. This can happen \nif the input of the L T3012 is connected to a discharged \n(low voltage) battery and the output is held up by either \na backup battery or a second regulator circuit. The state \nof the SHDN  pin will have no effect on the reverse output \ncurrent when the output is pulled above the input.OUTPUT VOLTAGE (V)0REVERSE OUTPUT CURRENT (µA)120160200\n8\n3012 F0480\n40100140180\n60\n20\n0\n2 1 4 3 6 7 9 5 10ADJ \nPIN CLAMP\n(SEE ABOVE)TJ = 25°C\nVIN = 0V\nVOUT = VADJ\nCURRENT FLOWS\nINTO OUTPUT PIN\nLT301213\nRev.
