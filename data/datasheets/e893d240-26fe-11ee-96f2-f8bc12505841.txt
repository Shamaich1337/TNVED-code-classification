REVISION HISTORY  ................................ ................................ ................................ ....................  108 \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 6 -                                      -Revision B  1. GENERAL DESCRIPTION S \nThe W25Q02JV  (four x 512M -bit stack die) Multi Chip Package Ser ial Flash memory provides a storage \nsolution for systems  with limited space, pins and power. The 25Q series offers flexibility and performance \nwell beyond ordinary Serial Flash devices. They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM, executing code \ndirectly from  Dual/Quad SPI (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operates on a single 2.7V \nto 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 4µA for power -down. All devices are offered in \nspace -saving packages.  \n \nThe W25Q02JV device is a four 512M -bit stack die that supports linear addressing for the full 2G -bit memory \naddress range; and continuously read accessible only into four separate 512Mb address memory segments: \n00000000h to 03FFFFFFh, 04000000h to 07FFFFFFh, 08000000h to 0BFFFFFFh, and 0C0000 00h to \n0FFFFFFFh. The W25Q02JV array is organized into 1,048,576 programmable pages of 256 -bytes each. Up to \n256 bytes can be programmed at a time. Pages can be erased in groups of 16 (4KB sector erase), groups of \n128 (32KB block erase), groups of 256 (64K B block erase) or the entire chip (chip erase). The W25Q02JV has \n32,768 erasable 4KB sectors and 2,048 erasable 64KB blocks respectively. The small 4KB sectors allow for \ngreater flexibility in applications that require data and parameter storage.  \n \nAs the W 25Q02JV is a four die stack device, there can only be one active and three non -active die at any \ngiven time to communicate with the external SPI controller. Active die is determined from power up, reset, \nmemory boundaries during memory/register access, or by special Software Die Select instruction. The \nW25Q stack die product series introduces a new “Software Die Select (C2h)” instruction, and a factory  \nassigned “Die ID#” for each stacked die. Each 512M -bit die can be accessed independently, even though \nthe interface is shared and memory addressing is linear from 0 to 2G -bit memory address. Each 512M -bit \ndie has its own 64 -bit Unique Serial Number. Each die also has their individual (independent) ‘Status only’ \nStatus Register bits including BUSY bit, and SUS bit that provides the current state of the die.  \n \nThe W25Q02JV support the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O SPI, Quad \nPeripheral Interface (QPI) as well as Double Transfer Rate (DTR): Serial Clock, Chip Select, Serial Data \nI/O0 (DI) , I/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP ), and I/O3 (/HOLD). SPI clock frequencies of up to 133MHz are supported \nallowing equivalent clock rates of 266MHz (104MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 532MHz (104MHz x 4) for Quad \nI/O when using the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O instructions. The se transfer rates can outperform standard \nAsynchronous 8 and 16 -bit Parallel Flash memories. The Continuous Read Mode allows for efficient \nmemory access with as few as 8 -clocks of instruction -overhead to read a 24 -bit address, allowing true XIP \n(execute in  place) operation.  \n \nAdditionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID and SFDP Register, and \nthree 256 -bytes Security Registers.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 7 -                                    -Revision B  2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS is high the device is \ndesel ected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption will be at standby levels unless an internal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. When /CS is b rought low the device will be selected, power \nconsumption will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device. \nAfter power -up, /CS must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The / CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up and power -down (see “Write Protection” and Figure \n58). If needed a pull -up resist or on the /CS pin can be used to accomplish this.  \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25Q02 JV supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions use \nthe unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising \nedge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard  SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to read \ndata or status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or \ndata to the device on the rising edg e of CLK and read data or status from the device on the falling edge of \nCLK. Quad SPI instructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set.  \nWhen QE=1, the /WP pin becomes IO2 and /HOLD pin becomes IO3.  \n4.3 Write Protect ( /WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the Status Register’s Block Protect (CMP, TB, BP3, BP2, BP1 and BP0) bits and Status \nRegister Protect (SRP) bits, a portion as small as  a 4KB sector or the entire memory array can be \nhardware protected. The /WP pin is active low. When the QE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, \nthe /WP pin function is not available since this pin is used for IO2. See Figure 1a -c for the pin \nconfi guration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nThe /HOLD pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively selected. When /HOLD is brought low, \nwhile /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals on the DI and CLK pins will be ignored \n(don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation can resume. The /HOLD function can be \nuseful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI signals. The /HOLD pin is active low. When the \nQE bit of Status Register -2 is set for Quad I/O, the /HOLD p in function is not available since this pin is \nused for IO3. See Figure 1a -c for the pin configuration of Quad I/O operation.  \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations. ("See SPI \nOper ations")  \n4.6 Reset (/RESET)  \nThe /RESET pin allows the device to be reset by the controller. For 8 -pin packages, when QE=0, the IO3 \npin can be configured either as a /HOLD pin or as a /RESET pin depending on Status Register setting. \nWhen QE=1, the /HOLD or /RES ET function is not available for 8 -pin configuration.  \nA dedicated hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 and TFBGA packages. When it’s driven low for \na minimum period of ~1µS, this device will terminate any external or internal operations and return t o its \npower -on state.  \nNote: Hardware /RESET pin is available on SOIC -16 or TFBGA; please contact Winbond for this package.  \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 10 -                                      -Revision B  5.

W25Q02 JV Serial Flash Memory Operation Diagram  \n \n6.1.1  Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q02 JV is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock (CLK), \nChip Select ( /CS), Serial Data Input  (DI) and Serial Data Ou tput (DO). Standard SPI instructions use the \nDI input pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of CLK . The  \nDO output pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge  of CLK.  \nSPI bus opera tion Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is \nnot being transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 , the CLK signa l is normally low  on the falling and \nrising edges of /CS.  For Mode 3 , the CLK signal is normally high  on the falling and rising edges of /CS .  \n6.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q02 JV support s Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as  “Fast Read Dual O utput  \n(3Bh)”  and “Fast Read Dual I/O  (BBh) ”. These instructions  allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice  at two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices.  The Dual SPI Read instruction s are \nideal for quickly downloading code to RAM  upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for execut ing non-speed -\ncritical  code directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions , the DI and DO pins \nbecome bidirectional I/ O pins:  IO0 and IO1.  \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 12 -                                      -Revision B  6.1.3  Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q02 JV supports Quad  SPI operation whe n using instructions such as  “Fast Read Quad  Output  \n(6Bh) ”, and “Fast Read  Quad  I/O (EBh) ”. These instructions allow data to be transferred to or from the \ndevice four to six times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. The Quad Read instructions o ffer a significant \nimprovement in continuous  and random access transfer rates allowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or \nexecution directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Quad SPI instructions the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional IO0 and IO1 , and the /W P and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO3 respectively. Quad SPI \ninstructions require the non -volatile Quad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 to be set . \n6.1.4  QPI Instructions  \nThe W25Q02 JV supports Quad Peripheral Interface (QPI) operations only when the device is switched \nfrom Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode to QPI mode using the “Enter QPI (38h)” instruction. The typical SPI \nprotocol requires that the byte -long instruction code being shifted into the device only via DI pin in eight \nserial clocks. The QPI mode utilizes  all four IO pins to input the instruction code, thus only two serial \nclocks are required. This can significantly reduce the SPI instruction overhead and improve system \nperformance in an XIP environment. Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode and QPI mode are exclusi ve. Only \none mode can be active at any given time. “Enter QPI (38h)” and “Exit QPI (FFh)” instructions are used to \nswitch between these two modes. Upon power -up or after a software reset using “Reset (99h)” instruction, \nthe default state of the device is S tandard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. To enable QPI mode, the non -volatile \nQuad Enable bit (QE) in Status Register -2 is required to be set.  When using QPI instructions, the DI and \nDO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1, and the /WP and /HOLD pins become IO2 and IO 3 \nrespectively. See Figure 3 for the device operation modes.  \n6.1.5  SPI / QPI DTR Read Instructions  \nTo effectively improve the read operation throughput without increasing the serial clock frequency, \nW25Q02 JV introduces multiple DTR (Double Transfer Rate) Read i nstructions that support \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI and QPI modes . The byte -long instruction code is still latched into the device on \nthe rising edge of the serial clock similar to all other SPI/QPI instructions. Once a DTR instruction code is \naccepted by the device, the address input and data output will be latched on both rising and falling edges \nof the serial clock.  \n6.1.6  3-Byte / 4 -Byte Address Modes  \nUpon power up, the W25Q02 JV can operate in either 3 -Byte Address Mode or 4 -Byte Address Mode, \ndepending on the Non -Volatile Status Register Bit AD P (S17) setting. If AD P=0, the device will operate in \n3-Byte Address Mode; if AD P=1, the device will operate in 4 -Byte Address Mode. The factory default value \nfor AD P is 0. \nTo switch between the 3 -Byte or 4-Byte Address Mode s, “Enter  4-Byte Mode (B7h)” or “ Exit 4-Byte Mode \n(E9h)” instructions must be used. The current address mode is indicated by the Status Register Bit AD S \n(S16).  \nW25Q02 JV also supports a set of basic SPI instructions which requires dedicated 4 -Byte address \nregardless the device Address Mode  setting . Please refer to Instruction Set Table s for details.  \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 13 -                                    -Revision B  6.1.7  Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, t he /HOLD  signal allows the W25Q02 JV operation to be \npaused while it is actively selected (when /CS is low). The /HOLD  function may be useful in cases where \nthe SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer \nwas only partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus. In this case the /HOLD  \nfunction can save the state of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where \nit left off once the bus is available again.  The /HOLD function is only available for standard SPI and Dual \nSPI operation, not during Quad SPI.  The Quad Enable Bit QE in Status Register -2 is used to determine if \nthe pin is used as /HOLD pin or data I/O pin. When QE=0 (factory default), the pin is /HOLD, when QE=1, \nthe pin will become an I/O pin, /HOLD function is no longer available.  \nTo initiate a /HOLD  condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A /HOLD  condition will activate on \nthe falling edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the \n/HOLD  condition will activate after the next falling edge  of CLK. The /HOLD  condition will terminate on the \nrising edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the /HOLD  \ncondition will terminate after the next falling edge of CLK.  During a /HOLD  condition, the Serial D ata \nOutput (DO) is high impedance, a nd Serial Data Input (DI ) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip \nSelect ( /CS) signal should be kept active (low) for the full duration of the /HOLD  operation to avoid \nresetting the internal logic state of the devic e. \n6.1.8  Software Reset & Hardware /RESET pin  \nThe W25Q02 JV can be reset to the initial power -on state by a software Reset sequence, either in SPI \nmode or QPI mode. This sequence must include two consecutive commands: Enable Reset (66h) & \nReset (99h). If the comm and sequence is successfully accepted, the device will take approximately 30uS \n(tRST) to reset. No command will be accepted during the reset period.  \nFor the WSON -8 package types, W25Q02 JV can also be configured to utilize a hardware /RESET pin. \nThe HOLD/RS T bit in the Status Register -3 is the configuration bit for /HOLD pin function or /RESET pin \nfunction. When HOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin acts as a /HOLD pin as described above; when \nHOLD/RST=1, the pin acts as a /RESET pin. Drive the /RESET pin lo w for a minimum period of ~1us \n(tRESET*) will reset the device to its initial power -on state. Any on -going Program/Erase operation will be \ninterrupted and data corruption may happen. While /RESET is low, the device will not accept any \ncommand input.  \nIf QE bit is set to 1, the /HOLD or /RESET function will be disabled, the pin will become one of the four \ndata I/O pins.  \n \nFor the SOIC -16 & TFBGA package, W25Q02 JV provides a dedicated /RESET pin in addition to the \n/HOLD (IO 3) pin as illustrated in Figure 1b. Dr ive the /RESET pin low for a minimum period of ~1us \n(tRESET*) will reset the device to its initial power -on state. The HOLD/RST bit or QE bit in the Status \nRegister will not affect the function of this dedicated /RESET pin.  \n \nHardware /RESET pin has the hig hest priority among all the input signals. Drive /RESET low for a \nminimum period of ~1us (tRESET*) will interrupt any on -going external/internal operations, regardless the \nstatus of other SPI signals (/CS, CLK, IOs, /WP and/or /HOLD).  \n \nNote:  \n1. While a faste r /RESET pulse (as short as a few hundred nanoseconds) will often reset the device, a \n1us minimum pulse is recommended to ensure reliable operation.  \n2. There is an internal pull -up resistor for the dedicated /RESET pin on the SOIC -16 & TFBGA package. If \nthe reset function is not used, this pin can be left floating in the system.  \n \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 14 -                                      -Revision B  6.2 Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and other \nadverse system conditions that may compromise data integri ty. To address this concern , the W25Q02 JV \nprovides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Time delay write disable after Power -up \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions  and a utomatic write disable a fter e rase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write p rotection using Status Registers  \n\uf0b7 Additional Individual Block/Sector Locks for array protection  \n\uf0b7 Write Protection using Power -down instruction   \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection for Status Register until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for array and Security Register s using Status Register* \n* Note : This feature  is available upon special flow. Please contact Winbond for details.  \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down , the W25Q02 JV will ma intain a reset condition while VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 43). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled for a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Page Program, Sector Erase, Block Erase, Chip Erase and the Write Status \nRegister instructions. Note that the chip select pin ( /CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until \nthe VCC -min level and t VSL time delay is reached , and it must also track the VCC supply level at power -\ndown to prevent adverse command sequence . If needed, a pull -up resistor on /CS pin can be used to \naccomplish this.   \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instruction must be issued before a Page Program, Sector \nErase, Block Erase, Chip Erase or Write Status Register instruction will be accepted. After completing a \nprogram, erase or write instruction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -\ndisabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using th e Write Status Register instruction and setting the \nStatus Register Protect ( SRP, SRL) and Block Protect ( CMP , TB, BP[3:0]) bits. These settings  allow a \nportion or the entire  memory  array  to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write \nProtect ( /WP) pin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See \nStatus Register section for further information.  Additionally, the Power -down instruction offers an extra \nlevel of write protection as all instructions a re ignored except for the Release Power -down instruction.  \nThe W25Q02JV also provides another Write Protect method using the Individual Block Locks. Each 64KB \nblock (except the top and bottom blocks of each 512Mb die, total of 4088 blocks) and each 4KB sect or \nwithin the top/bottom blocks of each die (total of 128 sectors) are equipped with an Individual Block Lock \nbit. When the lock bit is 0, the corresponding sector or block can be erased or programmed; when the lock \nbit is set to 1, Erase or Program instru ctions issued to the corresponding sector or block will be ignored. \nWhen the device is powered on, all Individual Block Lock bits will be 1, so the entire memory array is \nprotected from Erase/Program. An “Individual Block Unlock (39h)” instruction must be issued to unlock \nany specific sector or block.  \nThe WPS bit in Status Register -3 is used to decide which Write Protect scheme should be used. When \nWPS=0 (factory default), the device will only utilize CMP, TB, BP[3:0] bits to protect specific areas of the \narray; when WPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks for write protection.  \n \n \n \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 15 -                                    -Revision B  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 4.

STATUS  AND CONFIGURATION  REGISTERS  \nThree Status Registers  Status/Configuration  Registers are provided for W 25Q02 JV. The Read Status \nRegister -1/2/3 instructions are used to provide status on the availability of the flash memory array, whether \nthe device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection, Quad SPI setting, Se curity Register \nlock status, Erase/Program Suspend status, output driver strength, power -up and current Address Mode. \nThe Write Status Register instruction can be used to configure the device write protection features, Quad \nSPI setting, Security Register O TP locks, Hold/Reset functions, output driver strength and power -up \nAddress Mode. Write access to the Status Register is controlled by the state of the non -volatile Status \nRegister Protect bits (SRP, SRL), the Write Enable instruction, and during Standard/ Dual SPI operations, \nthe /WP pin.  \n  \nThe write to registers (without input address) instructions will write simultaneously to all the die registers \nas long as the die are not busy. Each die through Read Status Register instructions will provide its own \nstatus for BUSY and SUS status only. The four die stack operation of Read/Write Status and \nConfiguration Registers are detailed on Four Die Stack Operations section.  \n7.1 Status Registers  \n S 7 S 6 S 5 S 4 S 3 S 2 S 1 S 0 \nSRP  TB BP 3 BP 2 BP 1 BP 0 WEL  BUSY  \nStatus Register Protect   \n( Volatile  / Non - Volatile Writable  ) \nTop / Bottom Protect Bit  \n( Volatile  / Non - Volatile Writable  ) \nBlock Protect Bits  \n( Volatile  / Non - Volatile Writable  ) \nWrite Enable Latch  \n( Status  \ns - Only ) \nErase  / Write In Progress  \n( Status  \ns - Only ) \n \nFigure 4 a.

Block Prot ect bits can be set using the Write \nStatus Register Instruction (see t W in AC characteristics). All, none or a portion of the memory array can \nbe protected from Program and Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The \nfactory defau lt setting for the Block Protection Bits is 0, none of the array protected.   \n7.1.4  Top/Bottom Block Protect  (TB) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe non-volatile Top/Bottom bit (TB) controls if the Block Protect Bits ( BP3, BP2, BP1, BP0) protect from \nthe Top (T B=0) or the Bottom (TB=1) of the array as shown in the Status Register Memory Protection \ntable. The f actory default setting is TB=0. The TB bit can be set with the Write Status Register Instruction \ndepending on the state of the SRP, SRL and WEL bits.  \n7.1.5  Comp lement Protect (CMP)  – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Complement Protect bit (CMP) is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S14). It is used in \nconjunction with TB, BP3, BP2, BP1 and BP0 bits to provide more flexibility for the array pr otection. Once \nCMP is set to 1, previo us array protection set by TB, BP3, BP2, BP1 and BP0 will be reversed. For \ninstance, when CMP=0, a top 64KB block  can be protected while the rest of the array is not; when \nCMP=1, the top 64KB block  will become unprotec ted while the rest of the array become read -only. Please \nrefer to the Status Register Memory Protection table for details. The  default setting is CMP =0. \n7.1.6  Status Register Protect  (SRP , SRL) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Status  Register Protect bits (S RP) is  non-volatile read/write bits in the status register (S7). The SRP \nbit controls the method of write protection: software protection or hardware protection. The Status Register \nLock bits (SRL) is non-volatile/volatile read/write bits in the status reg ister (S8) .

The SUS status bit is cleared to 0 by Erase/Program Resume \n(7Ah) instruction as well as a power -down, power -up cycle.  \n \nThere is a limitation of four  die stack operation of SUS bit is detailed  on Four Die Stack Operations \nApplication Note .  \n7.1.8  Security Register Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1) – Non-Volatile OTP Writable  \nThe Secur ity Regist er Lock Bits (LB3, LB2, LB1 ,SFDP Lock Bit ) are non -volatile One Time Program \n(OTP) bits in Sta tus Register (S13, S12, S11 ,S10) that provide the write protect control and status to the \nSecurity Registers . The default state of LB[3:1]  is 0, Securi ty Registers are unlocked. LB[3:1]  can be set to \n1 individually using the Write Status Register instruction. LB[3:1]  are One Time Programmable (OTP), \nonce it’s set to 1, the corresponding 256 -Byte Security Register will become read -only permanently.  \n7.1.9  Quad En able (QE) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe Quad Enable  (QE) bit is a non -volatile read/write bit in the status register (S 9) that enable s Quad SPI \noperation . When the QE bit is set to a 0 state (factory default) , the /WP pin  and /HOLD  are enabled , the \ndevice operates in Standard/Dual SPI modes . When the QE bit is set to a 1 , the Quad IO2 and I O3 pins \nare enabled , and /WP and /HOLD functions are disabled , the device operates in Standard/Dual/Quad SPI \nmodes . \nQE bit is required to be set to a 1 before issu ing an “Enter QPI (38h)” to switch the device from \nStandard/Dual/Quad SPI to QPI, otherwise the command will be ignored. When the device is in QPI mode, \nQE bit will remain to be 1. A “Write Status Register” command in QPI mode cannot change QE bit from a \n“1” to a “0”.  \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 19 -                                    -Revision B  \nS23 S22 S21 S20 S19 S18 S17 S16\nHOLD\n/RSTDRV1DRV0 (R) WPS ADP ADS\nPower Up Address Mode\n(Non-Volatile Writable)Output Driver Strength\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\nReserved\nWrite Protect Selection\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)\nCurrent Address Mode\n(Status-Only)/HOLD or /RESET Function\n(Volatile/Non-Volatile Writable)(R) \nFigure 4 c. Status Register -3 \n7.1.10  Current Address Mode (AD S) – Status Only  \nThe Current Address Mode bit is a read only bit in the Status Register -3 that indicates which address \nmode the device is currently operating  in. When AD S=0, the device is in the 3 -Byte Address Mode, when \nADS=1, the device is in the 4 -Byte Address Mode.  \n7.1.11  Power -Up Address Mode (AD P) – Non-Volatile Writable  \nThe ADP bit is a non -volatile bit that determines  the initial address mo de when the device is powered on \nor reset . This bit is only used during the power on or device reset initialization period, and it is only writable \nby the non -volatile Write Status sequence (06h + 11h).  When ADP=0 (factory default), the device will \npower up into 3 -Byte Addre ss Mode. When ADP=1, the device will power up into 4 -Byte Address Mode \ndirectly.  \n7.1.12  Write Protect Selection (WP S) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe WPS bit is used to select which Write Protect scheme should be used . When WPS=0, the device will \nuse the com bination of CMP, TB, BP[3:0] bits to protect a specific area of the memory array. When \nWPS=1, the device will utilize the Individual Block Locks to protect any individual sector or blocks. The \ndefault value for all Individual Block Lock bits is 1 upon devi ce power on or after reset.  \n7.1.13  Output Driver Strength (DRV1, DRV0) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe DRV1 & DRV0 bits are used to determine the output driver strength for the Read operations . \nDRV1, DRV0  Driver Strength  \n0, 0 100%(default setting)  \n0, 1 75% \n1, 0 50% \n1, 1 25%  \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 20 -                                      -Revision B  7.1.14  /HOLD or /RESET Pin Function (HOLD/RST) – Volatile/Non -Volatile Writable  \nThe HOLD/RST bit is used to determine whether /HOLD or /RESET function should be implemented on \nthe hardware pin. When HOLD/RST=0 (factory default), the pin ac ts as /HOLD; when HOLD/RST=1, the \npin acts as /RESET. However, /HOLD or /RESET functions are only available when QE=0. If QE is set to \n1, the /HOLD and /RESET functions are disabled, the pin acts as a dedicated data I/O pin.  \n7.1.15  Reserved Bits – Non Functional  \nThere are a few reserved Status Register bits that may be read out as a “0” or “1”. It is recommended to \nignore the values of those bits. During a “Write Status Register” instruction, the Reserved Bits can be \nwritten as “0”, but there will not be any effec ts. \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 21 -                                    -Revision B  7.1.16  W25Q02 JV Status Register Memory Protection (WPS = 0, CMP = 0)   \nSTATUS REGISTER  W25Q02JV ADDRESS 00000000H TO 07FFFFFFH (DIE #0 & #1)  \nLOWER 1Gbit  MEMORY PROTECTION(1,2) \nTB BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 PROTECTED  \nBLOCK(S)  PROTECTED  \nADDRESSES  PROTECTED  \nDENSITY  PROTEC TED \nPORTION  \n0 0 0 0 0 NONE  NONE  NONE  NONE  \n0 0 0 0 1 2047  07FF0000h - 07FFFFFFh  64KB  1/2048  \n0 0 0 1 0 2046 thru 2047  07FE0000h - 07FFFFFFh  128KB  1/1024  \n0 0 0 1 1 2044 thru 2047  07FC0000h - 07FFFFFFh  256KB  1/512  \n0 0 1 0 0 2040 thru  2047  07F80000h - 07FFFFFFh  512KB  1/256  \n0 0 1 0 1 2032 thru  2047  07F00000h - 07FFFFFFh  1MB 1/128  \n0 0 1 1 0 2016 thru  2047  07E00000h - 07FFFFFFh  2MB 1/64 \n0 0 1 1 1 1984 thru  2047  07C00000h - 07FFFFFFh  4MB 1/32 \n0 1 0 0 0 1920 thru  2047  07800000h - 07FFFFFFh  8MB    1/16  \n0 1 0 0 1 1792 thru  2047  07000000h - 07FFFFFFh  16MB     1/8   \n0 1 0 1 0 1536 thru 2047  06000000h - 07FFFFFFh  32MB     1/4   \n0 1 0 1 1 1024 thru 2047  04000000h - 07FFFFFFh  64MB     1/2   \n0 1 1 0 0 0 thru 2047  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n0 1 1 0 1 0 thru 2047  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n0 1 1 1 0 0 thru 2047  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n0 1 1 1 1 0 thru 2047  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 0 0 0 0 NONE  NONE  NONE  NONE  \n1 0 0 0 1 0 00000000h - 0000FFFFh  64KB  1/2048  \n1 0 0 1 0 0 thru 1  0000000 0h - 0001FFFFh  128KB  1/1024  \n1 0 0 1 1 0 thru 31  00000000h - 0003FFFFh  256KB  1/512  \n1 0 1 0 0 0 thru 7  00000000h - 0007FFFFh  512KB  1/256  \n1 0 1 0 1 0 thru 15  00000000h - 000FFFFFh  1MB 1/128  \n1 0 1 1 0 0 thru 31  00000000h - 001FFFFFh  2MB 1/64 \n1 0 1 1 1 0 thru 63  00000000h - 003FFFFFh  4MB 1/32  \n1 1 0 0 0 0 thru 127  00000000h - 007FFFFFh  8MB  1/16  \n1 1 0 0 1 0 thru 255  00000000h - 00FFFFFFh  16MB  1/8   \n1 1 0 1 0 0 thru 511  00000000h - 01FFFFFFh  32MB  1/4   \n1 1 0 1 1 0 thru 1023  00000000h - 03FFFFFFh  64MB  1/2   \n1 1 1 0 0 2048 thru 4095  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 1 1 0 1 2048 thru  4095  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 1 1 1 0 2048 thru  4095  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 1 1 1 1 2048 thru  4095  00000000h – 07FFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \nContinued – next page  \n \n \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 22 -                                      -Revision B  (cont’d)  \nSTATUS REGISTER  W25Q02JV ADDRESS 08000000H TO 0FFFFFFFH (DIE #2 & #3)  \nUPPER 1Gbit  MEMORY PROTECTION(1,2) \nTB BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 PROTECTED  \nBLOCK(S)  PROTECTED  \nADDRESSES  PROTECTED  \nDENSITY  PROTECTED  \nPORTION  \n0 0 0 0 0 NONE  NONE  NONE  NONE  \n0 0 0 0 1 4095  0FFF0000h – 0FFFFFFFh  64KB  1/2048  \n0 0 0 1 0 4094 thru 4095  0FFE0000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128KB  1/1024  \n0 0 0 1 1 4092 thru 4095  0FFC0000h – 0FFFFFFFh  256KB  1/512  \n0 0 1 0 0 4088 thru 4095  0FF80000h – 0FFFFFFFh  512KB  1/256  \n0 0 1 0 1 4080 thru 4095  0FF000 00h – 0FFFFFFFh  1MB 1/128  \n0 0 1 1 0 4064 thru 4095  0FE00000h – 0FFFFFFFh  2MB 1/64 \n0 0 1 1 1 4032 thru 4095  0FC00000h – 0FFFFFFFh  4MB 1/32 \n0 1 0 0 0 3968 thru 4095  0F800000h – 0FFFFFFFh  8MB 1/16 \n0 1 0 0 1 3840 thru 4095  0F000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  16MB  1/8 \n0 1 0 1 0 3584 thru 4095  0E000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  32MB  1/4 \n0 1 0 1 1 3072 thru 4095  0C000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  64MB  1/2 \n0 1 1 0 0 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n0 1 1 0 1 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n0 1 1 1 0 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n0 1 1 1 1 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 0 0 0 0 NONE  NONE  NONE  NONE  \n1 0 0 0 1 2048  08000000h - 0800FFFFh  64KB  1/2048  \n1 0 0 1 0 2048 thru 2049  08000000h - 0801FFFFh  128KB  1/1024  \n1 0 0 1 1 2048 thru 2051  08000000h - 0803FFFFh  256KB  1/512  \n1 0 1 0 0 2048 thru 2055  08000000h - 0807FFFFh  512KB  1/256  \n1 0 1 0 1 2048 thru 2063  08000000h - 080FFFFFh  1MB 1/128  \n1 0 1 1 0 2048 thru 2079  08000000h - 081FFFFFh  2MB 1/64 \n1 0 1 1 1 2048 thru 2111  08000000h - 083FFFFFh  4MB 1/32 \n1 1 0 0 0 2048 thru 2175  08000000h - 087FFFFFh  8MB 1/16 \n1 1 0 0 1 2048 thru 2303  08000000h - 08FFFFFFh  16MB  1/8 \n1 1 0 1 0 2048 thru 2559  08000000h - 09FFFFFFh  32MB  1/4 \n1 1 0 1 1 2048 thru 3071  08000000h – 0BFFFFFFh  64MB  1/2 \n1 1 1 0 0 2048 th ru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 1 1 0 1 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 1 1 1 0 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \n1 1 1 1 1 2048 thru 4095  08000000h – 0FFFFFFFh  128MB  ALL \nNotes:  \n1.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the W25Q02 JV consists of 64 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table1 -4). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select (/CS).  The first byte of data clocked into the DI input provides the instruction code. \nData on the DI input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first.  \nThe QPI instruction set of the W25Q02 JV consists of 42 basic instructions th at are fully controlled through \nthe SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table 5-7). Instructions are initiated with the falling edge of Chip Select \n(/CS). The first byte of data clocked through IO[3:0] pins provides the instruction code. Data on all four IO \npins are sampled on the rising edge of clock with most significant bit (MSB) first. All QPI instructions, \naddresses, data and dummy bytes are using all four IO pins to transfer every byte of data with every four \nserial clocks (CLK).  \nFor SPI/QPI DTR Read instruc tions, the address input is sampled on both rising and falling edges of the \nclock; the data output is also ready on both edges of the clock.  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, d ummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a combination. Instructions are completed with the \nrising edge of edge /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in Figures 5 \nthrough 57. All read instructions can be completed after a ny clocked bit. However, all instructions that \nWrite, Program or Erase must complete on a byte boundary (/CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been \nclocked) otherwise the instruction will be ignored. This feature further protects the device from inadver tent \nwrites.

Read Status Register Instruction (QPI Mode)  \n \n \n8.5.5  Write Status Register -1 (01h), Status Register -2 (31h) & Status Register -3 (11h)  \nThe Write Status Register instruction allows the Status Re gisters to be written. The writable Status \nRegister bits include: SRP, TB, BP[3:0] in Status Register -1; CMP, LB[3:1], QE, SRL in Status Register -2; \nHOLD/RST, DRV1, DRV0, WPS & ADP in Status Register -3. All other Status Register bit locations are \nread-only and will not be affected by the Write Status Register instruction. LB[3:1] are non -volatile OTP \nbits, once it is set to 1, it cannot be cleared to 0.  \nTo write non -volatile Status Register bits, a standard Write Enable (06h) instruction must previously ha ve \nbeen executed for the device to accept the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL \nmust equal 1). Once write enabled, the instruction is entered by driving /CS low, sending the instruction \ncode “01h/31h/11h”, and then writing the stat us register data byte as illustrated in Figure 9a & 9b.  \nTo write volatile Status Register bits, a Write Enable for Volatile Status Register (50h) instruction must \nhave been executed prior to the Write Status Register instruction (Status Register bit WEL re mains 0). \nHowever, SRL and LB[3:1] cannot be changed from “1” to “0” because of the OTP protection for these \nbits. Upon power off or the execution of a Software/Hardware Reset, the volatile Status Register bit values \nwill be lost, and the non -volatile Stat us Register bit values will be restored.  \nDuring non -volatile Status Register write operation (06h combined with 01h/31h/11h), after /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Write Status Register cycle will commence for a time duration of t W (See AC \nCharacteristi cs). While the Write Status Register cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction \nmay still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Write Status \nRegister cycle and a 0 when the cycle is finished and rea dy to accept other instructions again. After the \nWrite Status Register cycle has finished, the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register will be \ncleared to 0.  \nDuring volatile Status Register write operation (50h combined with 01h/31h/11h), after /CS is driven high, \nthe Status Register bits will be refreshed to the new values within the time period of t SHSL2  (See AC \nCharacteristics). BUSY bit will remain 0 during the Status Register bit refresh period.  \n \nW25Q02JV -DTR  \n \nPublication Release Date:  April 19, 2021  \n- 37 -                                    -Revision B  The Write Status Register instruction can be u sed in both SPI mode and QPI mode.

The \ninstruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “03h” followed by a \n32/24-bit address ( A31/A23-A0) into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge \nof the CLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be \nshifted out on the DO pin at the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The address is \nautomatically incremented to the next higher address after  each byte of data is shifted out allowing for a \ncontinuous stream of data. This means that the entire memory can be accessed with a single instruction \nas long as the clock continues. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nThe Read Data instruct ion sequence is shown in Figure 14. If a Read Data instruction is issued while an \nErase, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any \neffects on the current cycle.

Instead of 24 -\nbit address, 32 -bit address is needed following the instruction code 1 3h. No matter the device is operating \nin 3-Byte Address Mode or 4 -byte Address Mode, the Read Data with 4 -Byte Address instruction will \nalways require 32 -bit address.  \nThe Read Data with 4 -Byte Address instruction sequence is shown in Figure 15.

The Quad I/O dramatically reduces instruction \noverhead allowing faster random access for code execution (XIP) directly from the Quad SPI. The  Quad \nEnable bit (QE) of Status Regi ster-2 must be set to enable the Fast Read Quad I/O  Instruction .  \nFast Read Quad I/O with Configurable “Dummy Clocks” and “Wrap Length” in SPI mode   \nThe number of “dummy clocks” and “wrap length” of the “Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)” instruction in SPI \nmode ar e configurable. In standard SPI mode and before executing the Fast Read Quad I/O instruction, \nthe number of “dummy clocks” can be configured by the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” instruction. \nDepending on the Read Parameter Bits P[6:4] setting, the number of dummy clocks can be configured as \neither 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16. The default number of dummy clocks upon power up or after a Reset \ninstruction is 6.  \n \nThe Fast Read Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by issuing  \na “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command prior to EBh. The “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command can \neither enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EBh commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to eit her an 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the \nending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning boundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.   \nThe Burst with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address and then \nfill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without i ssuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction allows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 are used to specify the length of the wrap \naround section within a page.

T he Quad I/O dramatically reduces \ninstruction overhead allowing faster random access for code execution (XIP) directly from the Quad SPI. \nThe Quad Enable bit (QE) of Status Register -2 must be set to enable the Fast Read Quad I/O  Instruction .  \nDTR Fast Read Quad I/O with Configurable “Dummy Clocks” and “Wrap Length” in SPI mode  \n \nThe number of “dummy clocks” and “wrap length” of the “DTR Read Quad I/O (EDh)” instruction in SPI \nmode are configurable. In standard SPI mode and before executing the DTR Fast Read Q uad I/O \ninstruction, the number of “dummy clocks” can be configured by the “Set Read Parameters (C0h)” \ninstruction. Depending on the Read Parameter Bits P[6:4] setting, the number of dummy clocks can be \nconfigured as either 8, 10, 12, 14, or 16. The defaul t number of dummy clocks upon power up or after a \nReset instruction is 8.  \n \nThe DTR Fast Read Quad I/O instruction can also be used to access a specific portion within a page by \nissuing a “Set Burst with Wrap” (77h) command prior to EDh. The “Set Burst with  Wrap” (77h) command \ncan either enable or disable the “Wrap Around” feature for the following EDh commands. When “Wrap \nAround” is enabled, the data being accessed can be limited to either an 8, 16, 32 or 64 -byte section of a \n256-byte page. The output data starts at the initial address specified in the instruction, once it reaches the \nending boundary of the 8/16/32/64 -byte section, the output will wrap around to the beginning boundary \nautomatically until /CS is pulled high to terminate the command.  \n \nThe Burs t with Wrap feature allows applications that use cache to quickly fetch a critical address and then \nfill the cache afterwards within a fixed length (8/16/32/64 -byte) of data without issuing multiple read \ncommands.  \n \nThe “Set Burst with Wrap” instruction all ows three “Wrap Bits”, W6 -4 to be set. The W4 bit is used to \nenable or disable the “Wrap Around” operation while W6 -5 are used to specify the length of the wrap \naround section within a page.

Certain applications can benefit from this \nfeature and improve the overall system code execution performance.  \nSimilar to a Quad I/O instruction, the Set Burst with Wrap instruction is initiat ed by driving the /CS pin low and \nthen shifting the instruction code “77h” followed by 24/32 dummy bits and 8 “Wrap Bits”, W7 -0.

To exit the “Wrap Around” function and return to normal \nread operation, another S et Burst with Wrap instruction should be issued to set W4 = 1. The default value of W4 \nupon power on or after a software/hardware reset is 1.  \n \nIn QPI mode, the “Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch)” and “DTR Burst Read with Wrap (0Eh) instructions should be \nused to  perform the Read operation with “Wrap Around” feature. The Wrap Length set by W6 -4 in Standard SPI \nmode is only applicable in SPI mode and not in QPI mode. The Wrap Length in QPI mode is configured by “Set \nRead Parameters (C0h)” instruction.

This is accomplished by setting the \nnumber of dummy clocks and wrap length configurations for set of selected instructions. Set Re ad Parameters \n(C0h) instruction writes to the Read Parameter Register (P[7:0]). P[6:4] bits is the dummy clocks configuration, \nwhile P[1:0] bits is the wrap length configuration for QPI mode only.  \n \nIn SPI mode, SPI Set Read Parameters (C0h)" instruction wr ites to ‘Dummy Clocks’ P[6:4] bits only, while it will \nignore ‘Wrap Length’ P[1:0] bits input as they are don’t care in SPI mode. Conversely, QPI Set Read Parameters \ninstruction will write both to the P[6:4] and P[1:0] Read Parameter bits. The Set Read Par ameters instruction \nsequence is shown in Figure 31.  \n \nSet Read Parameters instruction (SPI or QPI) is used to configure the number of dummy cycles through P[6:4] \nRead Parameter bits for the following SPI, QPI, DTR, and QPI DTR instructions:   \n- Standard SPI mo de: Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh) and Fast Read Quad I/O with 4 -Byte Address (ECh) \ninstructions   \n- QPI mode: Fast Read (0Bh), Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh), and Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch) instructions  \n- SPI DTR mode: DTR Fast Read Quad I/O (EDh)   \n- QPI DTR mode: DTR Fast Read (0Dh) in QPI mode, DTR Fast Read Quad I/O (EDh) in QPI mode, and \nDTR Burst Read with Wrap (0Eh) in QPI mode instructions.   \nIn QPI mode only, Set Read Parameters instruction to P[1:0] Read Parameter bits is used to configure the “Wrap   \nLength” for the following QPI and QPI DTR read with wrap instructions:  \n- QPI mode: Burst Read with Wrap (0Ch) instruction  \n- QPI DTR mode: DTR Burst Read with Wrap (0Eh) instruction.   \nQPI “Wrap Length” (P[1:0] bits) is the field setting for the number of bytes to burst read (8 , 16, 32, or 64 bytes) \nbefore a wrap -around to the starting address. . The Wrap Length set by P[1;0] is only applicable in QPI mode and \nnot in SPI mode. The “Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)”, “Fast Read (0Bh)”, “DTR Fast Read Quad I/O (EDh)”, and \n“DTR Fast Read ( 0Dh)” instructions do not support wrap around feature in QPI mode.  \n \nThe dummy clocks for various Fast Read instructions in Standard/Dual/Quad/DTR SPI mode are fixed, except \nfor ”Fast Read Quad I/O (EBh)”, “Fast Read Quad I/O with 4 -Byte Address (ECh)”, and  “DTR Fast Read Quad I/O \n(EDh)” instructions. Please refer to the Instruction Tables 1 -4 and 7 -8 for details. “Wrap Length” for the SPI ”Fast \nRead Quad I/O (EBh)” and “DTR Fast Read Quad I/O (EDh)” instructions is set by W6 -4 bit with the “Set Burst \nwith W rap (77h)” instruction.  \nThe Wrap bits (Set Burst with Wrap ‘77h’) as well as Read Parameter bits P[7:0] setting will remain unchanged \nwhen the device is switched from Standard SPI mode to QPI mode or vice versa. It is very important that the \nrequired dummy  cycles and wrap length are set properly before executing the SPI (EBh, ECh), QPI (0Bh, EBh, \n0Ch), DTR (EDh), and QPI DTR (0Dh, EDh, 0Eh) instructions.  \n \nThe default Parameter Read “Dummy Clocks” and “Wrap Length“ settings for selected SPI, QPI, DTR, and QP I \nDTR read instructions after power up or reset are defined on the tables below. After power up or reset, Read \nParameter bits are reset to 00h.

If the last address byte is not zero, and the number of clocks exceeds the remaining \npage length, the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the page. In some cases, less than 256 bytes (a \npartial page) can be programmed without having any effect on other bytes within the same page. One \ncondition to perform a partial page program is that the number of clocks cannot exceed the remaining \npage length. If more than 256 bytes are sent to the device the addressing will wrap to the beginning of the \npage and overwrite previously sent data.  \nAs with the write and erase instructions, the /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte \nhas been latched. If this is not done the Page Program  instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven \nhigh, the self -timed Page Program instruction will commence for a time duration of tpp (See AC \nCharacteristics). While the Page Program cycle is in progress, the Read Status Register instruction may \nstill be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Page Program \ncycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept other instructions \nagain. After the Page Program cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register \nis cleared to 0. The Page Program instruction will not be executed if the addressed page is protected by \nthe Block Protect (CMP, TB, BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits or the Individual Block/Sector Locks.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (02h)8 9 10 28 29 30 39\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1\n*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47\nData Byte 248 49 50 52 53 54 55\n2072\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 051 39\n031\n032 33 34 35 36 37 38\nData Byte 1\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n*\nMode 0Mode 3\nData Byte 3\n2073\n2074\n2075\n2076\n2077\n2078\n20790\nData Byte 256\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*= MSB*\n \nFigure 32a.

The Quad Page Program can \nimprove performance for PROM Programmer and applications that have slow clock speeds <5MH z. \nSystems with faster clock speed will not realize much benefit for the Quad Page Program instruction since \nthe inherent page program time is much greater than the time it take to clock -in the data.  \nTo use Quad Page Program the Quad Enable (QE) bit in Sta tus Register -2 must be set to 1. A Write \nEnable instruction  must be executed before the device will accept the Quad Page Program instruction \n(Status Register -1, WEL=1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low then shifting the \ninstruction c ode “32h” followed by a 24/32 -bit address (A23/A31 -A0) and at least one data byte, into the IO \npins. The /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the \ndevice. All other functions of Quad Page Program are identical to standard Page Program.

The Erase/Program Suspend instruction sequence is shown in Figure 42a & 42b. \nThe Write Status Register instruction (01h) and Erase instructions (20h, 52h, D8h, C7h, 60h, 44h) are no t \nallowed during Erase Suspend. Erase Suspend is valid only during the Sector or Block erase operation. If \nwritten during the Chip Erase operation, the Erase Suspend instruction is ignored. The Write Status \nRegister instruction (01h) and Program instructio ns (02h, 32h, 42h) are not allowed during Program \nSuspend. Program Suspend is valid only during the Page Program or Quad Page Program operation.  \nThe Erase/Program Suspend instruction “75h” will be accepted by the device only if the SUS bit in the \nStatus Re gister equals to 0 and the BUSY bit equals to 1 while a Sector or Block Erase or a Page \nProgram operation is on -going. If the SUS bit equals to 1 or the BUSY bit equals to 0, the Suspend \ninstruction will be ignored by the device. A maximum of time of “t SUS” (See AC Characteristics) is required \nto suspend the erase or program operation. The BUSY bit in the Status Register will be cleared from 1 to \n0 within “t SUS” and the SUS bit in the Status Register will be set from 0 to 1 immediately after \nErase/Program S uspend. For a previously resumed Erase/Program operation, it is also required that the \nSuspend instruction “75h” is not issued earlier than a minimum of time of “t SUS” following the preceding \nResume instruction “7Ah”.  \nUnexpected power off during the Erase/ Program suspend state will reset the device and release the \nsuspend state. SUS bit in the Status Register will also reset to 0. The data within the page, sector or block \nthat was being suspended may become corrupted. It is recommended for the user to imple ment system \ndesign techniques against the accidental power interruption and preserve data integrity during \nerase/program suspend state.  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (75h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3tSUS\nAccept instructions\n \nFigure 42a.

After issued the SUS bit will be cleared from 1 to 0 immediately, the BUSY bit will be set from \n0 to 1 within 200ns and the Sector or Block will complete the erase opera tion or the page will complete the \nprogram operation. If the SUS bit equals to 0 or the BUSY bit equals to 1, the Resume instruction “7Ah” \nwill be ignored by the device. The Erase/Program Resume instruction sequence is shown in Figure 43a & \n43b. \nResume ins truction is ignored if the previous Erase/Program Suspend operation was interrupted by \nunexpected power off.

The lower power consumption makes the Power -down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applications (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC Characteristics). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and  shifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in \nFigure 44a & 44b.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -down \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state w ill entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics). While in the power -down state only the Release Power -down \n(ABh) instruction, which restores the device to normal operation, will be recognized. All other instructions \nare ignored. This i ncludes the Read Status Register instruction, which is always available during normal \noperation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for securing \nmaximum write protection.

It can be used to \nrelease the device from the power -down state , or obtain the devices electronic identification (ID) number.  \nTo release the device from the power -down state, the ins truction is issued by driving the /CS pin low, \nshifting the instruction code “ABh” and driving /CS high as shown in Figure 45a & 45b. Release from \npower -down will take the time duration of t RES1 (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume \nnormal  operation and other instructions are accepted. The /CS pin must remain high during the t RES1 time \nduration.  \nWhen used only to obtain the Device ID while not in the power -down state, the instruction is initiated by \ndriving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “ABh” followed by 3 -dummy bytes. The Device ID \nbits are then shifted out on the falling edge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The Device ID \nvalues for the W25Q02 JV is listed in Manufacturer and Device Identification table. The  Device ID can be \nread continuously. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high.  \nWhen used to release the device from the power -down state and obtain the Device ID, the instruction is \nthe same as previously described, and shown in Figure 45, except that after /CS is driven high it must \nremain high for a time duration of t RES2 (See AC Characteristics). After this time duration the device will \nresume normal operation and other instructions will be accepted. If the Release from Power -down / \nDevice ID in struction is issued while an Erase, Program or Write cycle is in process (when BUSY equals \n1) the instruction is ignored and will not have any effects on the current cycle. \n \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (ABh)Mode 0Mode 3tRES1\nPower-down current Stand-by current\n \nFigure 45a.

The SFDP parameters \nare stored in one or more Parameter Identification (PID) tables. Currently only one PID table is spec ified, \nbut more may be added in the future. The Read SFDP Register instruction is compatible with the SFDP \nstandard initially established in 2010 for PC and other applications, as well as the JEDEC standard \nJESD216 -Serials  that is published in 2011. Most W inbond SpiFlash Memories shipped after June 2011 \n(date code 1124 and beyond) support the SFDP feature as specified in the applicable datasheet.  \nThe Read SFDP instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “5Ah” \nfollowed by a 24 -bit address (A23 -A0)(1) into the DI pin. Eight “dummy” clocks are also required before the \nSFDP register contents are shifted out on the falling edge of the 40th CLK with most significant bit (MSB) \nfirst as shown in Figure 51. For SFDP register  values and descriptions, please refer to the Winbond \nApplication Note for SFDP Definition Table.  \nNote: 1.

These reg isters may be used by the system manufacturers to store security and other \nimportant information separately from the main memory array.  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction is similar to the Sector Erase instruction. A Write Enable \ninstruction must be e xecuted before the device will accept the Erase Security Register Instruction (Status \nRegister bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “44h” followed by a 24/32 -bit address (A23/A31 -A0) to erase one of the three security \nregisters.  \nADDRESS  {A23/A31} -16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h/0000h  0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #2  00h/0000h  0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nSecurity Register #3  00h/0000h  0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Don’t Care  \nThe Erase Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 52. The /CS pin must be driven high \nafter the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the instruction will not be executed. \nAfter /CS is driven high, t he self -timed Erase Security Register operation will commence for a time \nduration of t SE (See AC Characteristics). While the Erase Security Register cycle is in progress, the Read \nStatus Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of  the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is \na 1 during the erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the device is ready to accept \nother instructions again. After the Erase Security Register cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch \n(WEL) bit in the St atus Register is cleared to 0. The Security Register Lock Bits ( LB[3:1] ) in the Status \nRegister -2 can be used to OTP protect the security registers. Once a lock bit is set to 1, the corresponding \nsecurity register will be permanently locked, Erase Security  Register instruction to that register will be \nignored (Refer to section 7.1.8 for detail descriptions). \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (44h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 2 1 0\n*Mode 0Mode 3\n= MSB*\n \nFigure 52.

It allows from one \nbyte to 256 bytes of security register data to be programmed at previously erased  (FFh) memory locations. \nA Write Enable i nstruction must be executed before the device will accept the Program Security Register \nInstruction (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low then shifting \nthe instruction code “42h” followed by a 24/32 -bit addre ss (A23/A31 -A0) and at least one data byte, into \nthe DI pin. The /CS pin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to \nthe device.  \nADDRESS  {A23/A31} -16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h/0000h  0 0 0 1  0 0 0  0 Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h/0000h  0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h/0000h  0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nThe Program Security Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 53.

The instruction is initiated by driving \nthe /CS pin low and then shifting the instruction code “48h” followed by a 24/32 -bit address ( A23/A31 -A0) \nand eight “dummy” clocks into the DI pin. The code and address bits are latched on the rising edge of the \nCLK pin. After the address is received, the data byte of the addressed memory location will be shifted out \non the DO pin at the falling ed ge of CLK with most significant bit (MSB) first. The byte address is \nautomatically incremented to the next byte address after each byte of data is shifted out. Once the byte \naddress reaches the last byte of the register (byte address FFh), it will reset to  address 00h, the first byte \nof the register, and continue to increment. The instruction is completed by driving /CS high. The Read \nSecurity Register instruction sequence is shown in Figure 54. If a Read Security Register instruction is \nissued while an Era se, Program or Write cycle is in process (BUSY=1) the instruction is ignored and will \nnot have any effects on the current cycle. The Read Security Register instruction allows clock rates from \nD.C. to a maximum of F R (see AC Electrical Characteristics).  \nADDRESS  {A23/A31} -16 A15-12 A11-8 A7-0 \nSecurity Register #1  00h/0000h  0 0 0 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #2  00h/0000h  0 0 1 0  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \nSecurity Register #3  00h/0000h  0 0 1 1  0 0 0 0  Byte Address  \n \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (48h)\nHigh Impedance8 9 10 28 29 30 31\n24-Bit Address\n23 22 21 3 2 1 0\nData Out 1*\n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39\nDummy Byte\nHigh Impedance40 41 42 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55\n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7Data Out 2\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0\n*7 6 5 4 3 2 1 043 31\n0= MSB*\n \nFigure 54.

Howeve r, SPI mode and QPI mode cannot be used at the same time. “Enter QPI (38h)” \ninstruction is the only way to switch the device from SPI mode to QPI mode.  \nUpon power -up, the default state of the device upon is Standard/Dual/Quad SPI mode. This provides full \nbackward compatibility with earlier generations of Winbond serial fla sh memories. See Instruction Section \n8.2 for all supported SPI commands. In order to switch the device to QPI mode, the Quad Enable (QE) bit \nin Status Register -2 must be set to 1 first, a nd an “Enter QPI (38h)” instruction must be issued. If the Quad \nEnable (QE) bit is 0, the “Enter QPI (38h)” instruction will be ignored and the device will remain in SPI \nmode.  \nSee Instruction Section  8.3 and 8.4 for all the commands supported in QPI mode.  \nWhen the device is switched from SPI mode to QPI mode, the existing Write Enable and Program/Erase \nSuspend status, and the Wrap Length setting will remain unchanged.  \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (38h)\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3\n \nFigure 57.

Once the Reset instruction is accepted, any on -going \ninternal operations will be terminated and the device will return to its default power -on state and lose all \nthe current volatile settings, such as Volatile Status Register bits, Write Enable Latch (WEL) status, \nProgram/Erase Suspend status, Read parameter sett ing (P7 -P0), setting (M7 -M0) and Wrap Bit setting \n(W6-W4).  \n“Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” instructions can be issued in either SPI mode or QPI mode. To \navoid accidental reset, both instructions must be issued in sequence. Any other commands other t han  \n“Reset (99h)” after the “Enable Reset (66h)” command will disable the “Reset Enable” state. A new \nsequence of “Enable Reset (66h)” and “Reset (99h)” is needed to reset the device. Once the Reset \ncommand is accepted by the device, the device will take approximately tRST=30us to reset. During this \nperiod, no command will be accepted.  \nData corruption may happen if there is an on -going or suspended internal Erase or Program operation \nwhen Reset command sequence is accepted by the device. It is recommended to check the BUSY bit and \nthe SUS bit in Status Register before issuing the Reset command sequence.  \nMode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (99h)Mode 0Mode 3/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7\nInstruction (66h)\nHigh Impedance\n \nFigure 64a.
