Such a \ndirection contact may cause cracks in the ceramic body due to thermal shock. \n12.5 Solder volume \nSolder shall be used not to be exceeded the upper limits as shown below. \n \nAn increased solder volume increases mechanical stress on t he product. Exceeding solder volume may cause the failure of \nmechanical or electrical performance. \n \n12.6 Product's location \nThe following shall be considered when designing and laying out PCBs. (1) PCB shall be designed so that pr oducts are not subject to mechanical stress due to warping the board. \n[Products direction] \nProducts shall be located in the sideways direct ion (length: a < b) to the mechanical stress. \n \n(2) Components location on PCB separation \nIt is effective to implement the following measur es, to reduce stress in separating the board. \nIt is best to implement all of the following three measures; ho wever, implement as many measures as possible to reduce \nstress. \nContents of measures  Stress level  \n(1) Turn the mounting direction of  the component parallel to the \nboard separation surface.  A > D*1 \n(2) Add slits in the board separation part.  A > B \n(3) Keep the mounting position of the component away from the \nboard separation surface.  A > C \n*1 A > D is valid when stress is added vertical ly to the perforation as with hand separation. \nIf a cutting disc is used, stress will be diagonal  to the PCB, therefore A > D is invalid. \n \n \n〈Poor example 〉 〈Good example 〉ba\n\nSpec No.: JELF243B_0022P-01 P8/9 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD (3) Mounting components near screw holes \nWhen a component is mounted near a screw hole, it may be affected by the board deflec tion that occurs during the \ntightening of the screw. \nMount the component in a position as far away from the screw holes as possible. \n \n12.7 Handling of substrate \nAfter mounting products on a substrate, do not apply any stress to the product caused by bending or twisting to the substrate \nwhen cropping the substrate, inserting and removing a connector from the substrate or tighteni ng screw to the substrate. \nExcessive mechanical stress may cause cracking in the product. \n  \nBending Twisting \n12.8 Cleaning \nThe product shall be cleaned under the following conditions. \n(1) The cleaning temperature shall be 60°C max. If isopropyl al cohol (IPA) is used, the cleaning temperature shall be 40°C \nmax. \n(2) Perform ultrasonic cleaning under the following conditi ons. Exercise caution to prevent resonance phenomenon in \nmounted products and the PCB. \nItem Requirement \nPower 20 W/L max. \nTime 5 min max. \nFrequency 28 kHz to 40 kHz \n(3) Cleaner \nAlcohol-based cleaner: IPA \nAqueous agent: PINE ALPHA ST-100S \n(4) There shall be no residual flux or residual cleaner. Wh en using aqueous agent, rinse the product with deionized water \nadequately and completely dry it so that no cleaner is left. \n* For other cleaning, consul t our technical department. \n12.9 Storage and transportation \nStorage period Use the product within 6 months after delivery.  \nIf you do not use the product for more than 6 months, check solderability before using it. \nStorage conditions • The products shall be stored in a ro om not subject to rapid changes  in temperature and humidity. \nThe recommended temperature range is -10°C to  +40°C. The recommended relative humidity \nrange is 15% to 85%. Keeping the product in corrosive gases, such as sulfur, chlorine gas or acid may cause the poor \nsolderability. \n• Do not place the products directly on the floor; they should be placed on a palette so that they are \nnot affected by humidity or dust. \n• Avoid keeping the products in a place expos ed to direct sunlight, heat or vibration. \n• Avoid storing the product by itself bare (i.e. exposed directly to air). \nTransportation Excessive vibration and impact reduces the reliability of the products. Exercise caution when \nhandling the products. \n12.10 Resin coating \nThe inductance value may change and/or it may affect on the pr oduct's performance due to high cure-stress of resin to be \nused for coating/molding products. So please pay your careful att ention when you select resin. In prior to use, please make \nthe reliability evaluation with the product mounted in your application set. \n  \n\nSpec No.: JELF243B_0022P-01 P9/9 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.11 Handling of product \nInductance could change due to the effect of magnetism. Do  not use magnetized tweezers, magnets, or other similar tools \nwhen handling the product (instead, use tw eezers with resin or ceramic tips). \n12.12 Magnetic saturation \nA current exceeding the rated current could cause the in ductance value to drop due to magnetic saturation. \n \n13. \n Note \n(1) Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in vi ew of your specifications with our product being mounted to \nyour product. \n(2) You are requested not to use our product deviating from the reference specifications. \n(3) The contents of this reference specification are su bject to change without advance notice.
