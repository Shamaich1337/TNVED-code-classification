The SP3243E \nincludes one complementary receiver that remains alert to \nmonitor an external device’s Ring Indicate signal while the \ndevice is shutdown. The SP3243E and EB devices feature \nslew-rate limited outputs for reduced crosstalk and EMI. The \n“EU” and “EH” series are optimized for high speed with data \nrates up to 1Mbps, easily meeting the demands of high speed \nRS-232 applications. The SP3243E series uses an internal \nhigh-efficiency charge-pump power supply that requires only \n0.1µF capacitors in 3.3V operation. This charge pump and \nMaxLinear’s driver architecture allow the SP3243E series to \ndeliver compliant RS-232 performance from a single power \nsupply ranging from +3.0V to +5.5V. The AUTO ON-LINE  \nfeature allows the device to automatically “wake-up” during a \nshutdown state when an RS-232 cable is connected and a \nconnected peripheral is turned on.  Otherwise, the device \nautomatically shuts itself down, drawing less than 1µA.Features\n■Meets true EIA / TIA-232-F standards from a +3.0V to \n+5.5V power supply\n■Interoperable with EIA / TIA-232 and adheres to EIA /\nTIA-562 down to a +2.7V power source\n■AUTO ON-LINE® circuitry automatically wakes up from a \n1µA shutdown\n■Regulated Charge Pump yields stable RS-232 outputs \nregardless of VCC variations\n■Enhanced ESD specifications:\n\uf0a1\uf020±15kV Human Body Model\n\uf0a1\uf020±15kV IEC61000-4-2 Air Discharge\n\uf0a1\uf020±8kV IEC61000-4-2 Contact Discharge\n■250kbps minimum transmission rate (EB)\n■1000kbps minimum transmission rate (EU)\n■Ideal for high speed RS-232 applications\nOrdering Information - page 23\nSelection Table\nTable 1:  SP3243E Selection Table\nDevicePower \nSuppliesRS-232 \nDriversRS-232 \nReceiversExternal \nComponentsAuto On-Line \nCircuitryTTL \n3-State# of \nPinsData Rate \n(kbps)ESD \nRating\nSP3243E +3.0V to +5.5V 3 5 4 capacitors Yes Yes 28 120 15kV\nSP3243EB +3.0V to +5.5V 3 5 4 capacitors Yes Yes 28 250 15kV\nSP3243EH +3.0V to +5.5V 3 5 4 capacitors Yes Yes 28 460 15kV\nSP3243EU +3.0V to +5.5V 3 5 4 capacitors Yes Yes 28 1000 15kV\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet Revision History\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 iiRevision History\nRevision Release Date Change Description\n-- 02/05/06 Legacy Sipex Datasheet\n1.0.0 7/23/09 Convert to Exar Format, Update ordering information and change revision to 1.0.0.\n1.0.1 11/10/09 Add missing (EH) model identification for Driver output Skew and Transition-Region Slew Rate \nspecification and change revision to 1.0.1.\n1.0.2 06/06/11 Remove obsolete devices per PDN 110510-01 and change ESD rating to IEC61000-4-2.\n1.0.3 5/24/19 Convert to MaxLinear format.

The \nSP3243E devices feature MaxLinear’s proprietary and \npatented (U.S. 5,306,954) on-board charge pump circuitry \nthat generates ±5.5V RS-232 voltage levels from a single \n+3.0V to +5.5V power supply. The SP3243EU device can \noperate at a data rate of 1000kbps fully loaded.\nThe SP3243E is a 3-driver / 5-receiver device, ideal for \nportable or hand-held applications. The SP3243E includes \none complementary always-active receiver that can \nmonitor an external device (such as a modem) in \nshutdown.  This aids in protecting the UART or serial controller IC by preventing forward biasing of the protection \ndiodes where VCC may be disconnected.\nThe SP3243E series is an ideal choice for power sensitive \ndesigns. The  SP3243E devices feature AUTO ON-LINE \ncircuitry which reduces the power supply drain to a 1µA \nsupply current .\nIn many portable or hand-held applications, an RS-232 \ncable can be disconnected or a connected peripheral can \nbe turned off. Under these conditions, the internal charge \npump and the drivers will be shut down.  Otherwise, the \nsystem automatically comes online. This feature allows \ndesign engineers to address power saving concerns \nwithout major design changes.\nFigure 11:  Interface Circuitry Controlled by Microprocessor Supervisory CircuitSP3243E28\n24\n2127\n326\n5KΩ\n5KΩ\n5KΩ\n5KΩ\n5KΩ\nGNDC1+\nC1-\nC2+\nC2-V+\nV-VCC\n14\n13\n12\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n150.1 μF\n0.1 μF\n0.1 μF+\nC2C5\nC1+\n+\nC3\nC4+\n+0.1 μF\n0.1 μF\n9\n10\n11\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8RS-232\nOUTPUTS\nRS-232INPUTS\n2322\n21V\nCC\n25T1IN\nR1OUT R1INT2OUT\nR2OUTT2IN\nT3IN T3OUTT1OUT\nR2IN\nR3IN\nR4IN\nR5INR2OUT\nR3OUT\nR4OUT\nR5OUT\nONLINESHUTDOWN\nSTATUSUART\nor\nSerial μC\nμP\nSupervisor\nICTxD\nRTS\nDTR\nRxD\nCTS\nDSR\nDCD\nRI\nVCC\nVIN RESET\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet Drivers\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 9Theory of Operation\nThe SP3243E series is made up of four basic circuit blocks:\n1.Drivers\n2.Receivers\n3.The MaxLinear proprietary charge pump\n4.AUTO ON-LINE circuitry\nDrivers\nThe drivers are inverting level transmitters that convert TTL \nor CMOS logic levels to 5.0V EIA / TIA-232 levels with an \ninverted sense relative to the input logic levels.  Typically, \nthe RS-232 output voltage swing is ±5.4V with no load and \n±5V minimum fully loaded.  The driver outputs are \nprotected against infinite short-circuits to ground without \ndegradation in reliability.  These drivers comply with the \nEIA-TIA-232-F and all previous RS-232 versions. Unused \ndrivers inputs should be connected to GND or VCC.\nThe drivers have a minimum data rate of 250kbps (EB) or \n1000kbps (EU) fully loaded.\nFigure 12  shows a loopback test circuit used to test the \nRS-232 Drivers. Figure 13  shows the test results where \none driver was active at 1Mbps and all three drivers were \nloaded with an RS-232 receiver in parallel with a 250pF \ncapacitor. Figure 14  shows the test results of the loopback \ncircuit with all drivers active at 250kbps with typical \nRS-232 loads in parallel with 1000pF capacitors. A superior \nRS-232 data transmission rate of 1Mbps makes the \nSP3243EU an ideal match for high speed LAN and \npersonal computer peripheral applications.Figure 12:  Loopback Test Circuit for RS-232 Driver \nData Transmission Rates\nFigure 13:  Loopback Test Results at 1Mbps Figure 14:  Loopback Test Results at 250kbp sSP3243\nGNDT1IN\nTXINC1+\nC1-\nC2+\nC2-V+\nV-VCC0.1 μF\n0.1 μF\n0.1 μF+\nC2C5\nC1+\n+\nC3\nC4+\n+0.1 μF\n0.1 μF\nTTL/CMOS\nINPUTS+3V to +5V\n18SHUTDOWN5KΩR1OUT\n5KΩRXIN RXOUTTTL/CMOS\nOUTPUTS\nONLINER1INTXOUTT1OUT\nSTATUSVCC\nTo μP Supervisor\nCircuit1000pF 1000pF\n\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet Receivers\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 10Receivers\nThe receivers convert ±5.0V EIA / TIA-232 levels to TTL or \nCMOS logic output levels. Receivers are High-Z when the \nAUTO ON-LINE circuitry is enabled or when in shutdown.  \nThe truth table logic of the SP3243 driver and receiver \noutputs can be found in Table 6 .\n1.In AUTO ON-LINE Mode where ONLINE  = GND and SHUTDOWN  = \nVCC, the device will shut down if there is no activity present at the receiver \ninputs.\nThe SP3243E includes an additional non-inverting receiver \nwith an output R2OUT.  R2OUT  is an extra output that \nremains active and monitors activity while the other \nreceiver outputs are forced into high impedance. This \nallows a Ring Indicator (RI) signal from a peripheral to be \nmonitored without forward biasing the TTL / CMOS inputs \nof the other devices connected to the receiver outputs.\nSince receiver input is usually from a transmission line \nwhere long cable lengths and system interference can \ndegrade the signal, the inputs have a typical hysteresis \nmargin of 300mV.  This ensures that the receiver is virtually \nimmune to noisy transmission lines.  Should an input be left \nunconnected, an internal  5kΩ pull-down resistor to ground \nwill commit the output of the receiver to a HIGH state.\nCharge Pump\nThe charge pump is a MaxLinear-patented design (U.S. \n5,306,954) and uses a unique approach compared to older, \nless-efficient designs.  The charge pump still requires four \nexternal capacitors, but uses a four-phase voltage shifting \ntechnique to attain symmetrical 5.5V power supplies. The \ninternal power supply consists of a regulated dual charge \npump that provides output voltages of 5.5V regardless of \nthe input voltage (VCC) over the +3.0V to +5.5V range.  \nThis is important to maintain compliant RS-232 levels \nregardless of power supply fluctuations.\nThe charge pump operates in a discontinuous mode using \nan internal oscillator.  If the output voltages are less than a \nmagnitude of 5.5V, the charge pump is enabled.  If the \noutput voltages exceed a magnitude of 5.5V, the charge pump is disabled.  This oscillator controls the four phases \nof the voltage shifting. A description of each phase follows.\nPhase 1: VSS Charge Storage\nDuring this phase of the clock cycle, the positive side of \ncapacitors C1 and C2 are initially charged to VCC.  Cl+ is \nthen switched to GND and the charge in C1– is transferred \nto C2–.  Since C2+ is connected to VCC, the voltage \npotential across capacitor C2 is now 2 times VCC.\nFigure 15:  Charge Pump — Phase 1\nPhase 2: VSS Transfer\nPhase two of the clock connects the negative terminal of C2 \nto the VSS storage capacitor and the positive terminal of C2 \nto GND.  This transfers a negative generated voltage to C3. \nThis generated voltage is regulated to a minimum voltage \nof -5.5V. Simultaneous with the transfer of the voltage to \nC3, the positive side of capacitor C1 is switched to VCC and \nthe negative side is connected to GND.\nFigure 16:  Charge Pump — Phase 2Table 6:  SP3243E SHUTDOWN Truth Table\nSHUTDOWN TxOUT RxOUT R2OUT\n0 High-Z High-Z Active\n1 Active Active Active\nVCC = +5V\n–5V –5V+5V\nVSS Storage CapacitorVDD Storage Capacitor\nC1 C2\nC3C4\n+\n+++–\n– – –\nVCC = +5V\nVSS Storage CapacitorVDD Storage Capacitor\nC1 C2\nC3C4\n+\n+++–\n– – –\n-5.5V\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet AUTO ONLINE Circuitry\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 11Phase 3: VDD Charge Storage\nThe third phase of the clock is identical to the first phase — \nthe charge transferred in C1 produces -VCC in the negative \nterminal of C1, which is applied to the negative side of \ncapacitor C2.  Since C2+ is at VCC, the voltage potential \nacross C2 is 2 times VCC.\nFigure 17:  Charge Pump — Phase 3\nPhase 4: VDD Transfer\nThe fourth phase of the clock connects the negative \nterminal of C2 to GND, and transfers this positive \ngenerated voltage across C2 to C4, the VDD storage \ncapacitor. This voltage is regulated to +5.5V. At this \nvoltage, the internal oscillator is disabled.  Simultaneous \nwith the transfer of the voltage to C4, the positive side of \ncapacitor C1 is switched to VCC and the negative side is \nconnected to GND, allowing the charge pump cycle to \nbegin again.  The charge pump cycle will continue as long \nas the operational conditions for the internal oscillator are \npresent .\nFigure 18:  Charge Pump — Phase 4\nSince both V+ and V– are separately generated from VCC, \nin a no–load condition V+ and V– will be symmetrical.  \nOlder charge pump approaches that generate V– from V+ \nwill show a decrease in the magnitude of V– compared to \nV+ due to the inherent inefficiencies in the design. The clock rate for the charge pump typically operates at greater \nthan 250kHz.  The external capacitors can be as low as \n0.1µF with a 16V breakdown voltage rating.\nThe MaxLinear-patented charge pumps are designed to \noperate reliably with a range of low cost capacitors. Either \npolarized or non polarized capacitors may be used. If \npolarized capacitors are used they should be oriented as \nshown in the Typical Operating Circuit.  The V+ capacitor \nmay be connected to either ground or VCC (polarity \nreversed.)\nThe charge pump operates with 0.1µF capacitors for 3.3V \noperation.  For other supply voltages, see the table for \nrequired capacitor values. Do not use values smaller than \nthose listed. Increasing the capacitor values (for example, \nby doubling in value) reduces ripple on the transmitter \noutputs and may slightly reduce power consumption. C2, \nC3, and C4 can be increased without changing C1’s value.\nFor best charge pump efficiency, locate the charge pump \nand bypass capacitors as close as possible to the IC.  \nSurface mount capacitors are best for this purpose.  Using \ncapacitors with lower equivalent series resistance (ESR) \nand self-inductance, along with minimizing parasitic PCB \ntrace inductance, will optimize charge pump operation.  \nDesigners are also advised to consider that capacitor \nvalues may shift over time and operating temperature.\nAUTO ONLINE Circuitry\nThe SP3243E devices have a patent pending AUTO ON-\nLINE circuitry on board that saves power in applications \nsuch as laptop computers, palmtop (PDA) computers and \nother portable systems.\nThe SP3243E devices incorporate an  AUTO ON-LINE \ncircuit that automatically enables itself when the external \ntransmitters are enabled and the cable is connected. \nConversely, the AUTO ON-LINE circuit also disables most \nof the internal circuitry when the device is not being used \nand goes into a standby mode where the device typically \ndraws 1µA. This function is externally controlled by the \nONLINE  pin.

Once active, the device \nis enabled until there is no activity on the receiver inputs.  \nThe receiver input typically sees at least ±3V, which is \ngenerated from the transmitters at the other end of the \ncable with a ±5V minimum. \nWhen the external transmitters are disabled or the cable is \ndisconnected, the receiver inputs will be pulled down by \ntheir internal 5kΩ resistors to ground. When this occurs \nover a period of time, the internal transmitters will be \ndisabled and the device goes into a shutdown or standby \nmode.  When ONLINE  is HIGH, the AUTO ON-LINE mode \nis disabled.  \nThe AUTO ON-LINE  circuit has two stages:\n1.Inactive Detection\n2.Accumulated Delay\nFigure 19:  AUTO ON-LINE Timing Waveforms\nThe first stage, shown in Figure 23 , detects an inactive \ninput.  A logic HIGH is asserted on RXINACT if the cable is \ndisconnected or the external transmitters are disabled.  \nOtherwise, RXINACT will be at a logic LOW.  This circuit is \nduplicated for each of the other receivers.\nThe second stage of the AUTO ON-LINE circuitry, shown in \nFigure 24 , processes all the receiver’s RXINACT signals \nwith an accumulated delay that disables the device to a \n1µA supply current.  \nThe STATUS  pin goes to a logic LOW when the cable is \ndisconnected, the external transmitters are disabled, or the \nSHUTDOWN  pin is invoked.  The typical accumulated \ndelay is around 20µs. \nWhen the SP3243E drivers or internal charge pump are disabled, the supply current is reduced to 1µA.  This can \ncommonly occur in hand-held or portable applications \nwhere the RS-232 cable is disconnected or the RS-232 \ndrivers of the connected peripheral are turned off. \nThe AUTO ON-LINE mode can be disabled by the \nSHUTDOWN  pin.  If this pin is a logic LOW, the AUTO ON-\nLINE function will not operate regardless of the logic state \nof the ONLINE  pin.  Table 8  summarizes the logic of the \nAUTO ON-LINE operating modes.  The truth table logic of \nthe SP3243E driver and receiver outputs can be found in \nTable 6 .\nThe STATUS  pin outputs a logic LOW signal if the device is \nshutdown.  This pin goes to a logic HIGH when the external \ntransmitters are enabled and the cable is connected.\nWhen the SP3243E devices are shut down, the charge \npumps are turned off.  V+ charge pump output decays to \nVCC, the V- output decays to GND.  The decay time will \ndepend on the size of capacitors used for the charge pump. \nOnce in shutdown, the time required to exit the shut down \nstate and have valid V+ and V- levels is typically 200µs.\nFor easy programming, the STATUS  can be used to \nindicate DSR or a Ring Indicator signal.  Tying ONLINE  and \nSHUTDOWN  together will bypass the AUTO ON-LINE \ncircuitry so this connection acts like a shutdown input pin.\nFigure 20:  SP3243E Driver Output Voltages vs. Load \nCurrent per Transmitter\nThe SP3243E driver outputs are able to maintain voltage \nunder loading of up to 2.5mA per driver, ensuring sufficient \noutput for mouse-driving applications.RECEIVER\nRS-232 INPUT\nVOLTAGES\nSTATUS\n+5V\n0V\n-5VtSTSL\ntSTSH\ntONLINEVCC\n0V\nDRIVER\nRS-232 OUTPUT\nVOLTAGES0V+2.7V\n-2.7VS\nH\nU\nT\nD\nO\nW\nN\n6\n420\n-2-4-6Transmitter Output Voltage [V]\nLoad Current Per Transmitter [mA]Vout+\nVout-0.62\n0.869\n0.939\n1.021.121.231.381.571.822.673.464.93\n8.6\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet  AUTO ONLINE Circuitry\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 13Figure 21:  Mouse Drive Application\nFigure 22:  Attaching S P3243E to a DB-9 Connector0+ VOUT\nVOUT- 10\n6\n7\n8\n91\n2\n3\n4\n5DB-9\nConnector\n6.

The ESD structure \nis improved over our previous family for more rugged \napplications and environments sensitive to electro-static \ndischarges and associated transients. The improved ESD \ntolerance is at least ±15kV without damage nor latch-up.  \nThere are different methods of ESD testing applied: \na.MIL-STD-883, Method 3015.7\nb.IEC61000-4-2 Air-Discharge\nc.IEC61000-4-2 Direct Contact \nThe Human Body Model has been the generally accepted \nESD testing method for semiconductors.  This method is \nalso specified in MIL-STD-883, Method 3015.7 for ESD \ntesting. The premise of this ESD test is to simulate the \nhuman body’s potential to store electro-static energy and \ndischarge it to an integrated circuit.  The simulation is \nperformed by using a test model as shown in Figure 25 .   \nThis method will test the IC’s capability to withstand an \nESD transient during normal handling such as in \nmanufacturing areas where the ICs tend to be handled \nfrequently. \n The IEC-61000-4-2, formerly IEC801-2, is generally used \nfor testing ESD on equipment and systems.  For system \nmanufacturers, they must guarantee a certain amount of \nESD protection since the system itself is exposed to the \noutside environment and human presence.  The premise \nwith IEC61000-4-2 is that the system is required to \nwithstand an amount of static electricity when ESD is \napplied to points and surfaces of the equipment that are \naccessible to personnel during normal usage.  The \ntransceiver IC receives most of the ESD current when the \nESD source is applied to the connector pins.  The test \ncircuit for IEC61000-4-2 is shown on Figure 26 .  There are \ntwo methods within IEC61000-4-2, the Air Discharge \nmethod and the Contact Discharge method.  \nWith the Air Discharge Method, an ESD voltage is applied \nto the equipment under test (EUT) through air.  This \nsimulates an electrically charged person ready to connect a \ncable onto the rear of the system only to find an unpleasant \nzap just before the person touches the back panel.  The \nhigh energy potential on the person discharges through an \narcing path to the rear panel of the system before he or she \neven touches the system.  This energy, whether discharged \ndirectly or through air, is predominantly a function of the \ndischarge current rather than the discharge voltage.  \nVariables with an air discharge such as approach speed of \nthe object carrying the ESD potential to the system and humidity will tend to change the discharge current.  For \nexample, the rise time of the discharge current varies with \nthe approach speed.\nThe Contact Discharge Method applies the ESD current \ndirectly to the EUT.  This method was devised to reduce the \nunpredictability of the ESD arc.  The discharge current rise \ntime is constant since the energy is directly transferred \nwithout the air-gap arc.  In situations such as hand held \nsystems, the ESD charge can be directly discharged to the \nequipment from a person already holding the equipment.  \nThe current is transferred on to the keypad or the serial port \nof the equipment directly and then travels through the PCB \nand finally to the IC.\nThe circuit models in Figure 25  and Figure 26  represent the \ntypical ESD testing circuit used for all three methods.  The \nCS is initially charged with the DC power supply when the \nfirst switch (SW1) is on.  Now that the capacitor is charged, \nthe second switch (SW2) is on while SW1 switches off.  \nThe voltage stored in the capacitor is then applied through \nRS, the current limiting resistor, onto the device under test \n(DUT).  In ESD tests, the SW2 switch is pulsed so that the \ndevice under test receives a duration of voltage. \nFor the Human Body Model, the current limiting resistor \n(RS) and the source capacitor (CS) are 1.5kΩ and 100pF, \nrespectively.  For IEC-61000-4-2, the current limiting \nresistor (RS) and the source capacitor (CS) are 330Ω and \n150pF, respectively. \nThe higher CS value and  lower RS value in the \nIEC61000-4-2 model are more stringent than the Human \nBody Model.  The larger storage capacitor injects a higher \nvoltage to the test point when SW2 is switched on.  The \nlower current limiting resistor increases the current charge \nonto the test point.\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet ESD Tolerance\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 16Figure 25:  ESD Test Circuit for Human Body Model\nFigure 26:  ESD Test Circuit for IEC61000-4-2\nFigure 27:  ESD Test Waveform for IEC61000-4-2    RC\nDevice\nUnder\nTestDC Power \nSourceCSRS\nSW1 SW2\n   RS and\n RV add up to 330Ω for IEC1000-4-2.RC\nDeviceUnder\nTestDC Power \nSource CSRS\nSW1 SW2RVContact-Discharge Model\nt = 0ns t = 30ns0A15A30A\nI →\nt →Table 9:  Transceiver ESD Tolerance Levels\nDevice Pin \nTestedHuman \nBody ModelIEC 61000-4-2\nAir Discharge Direct ContactLevel\nDriver outputs ±15kV ±15kV ±8kV 4\nReceiver inputs ±15kV ±15kV ±8kV 4\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet  Mechanical Dimensions\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 17Mechanical Dimensions\nQFN32\nFigure 28:  Mechanical Dimension s, QFN32Revision: BDrawing No.: POD-00000036TOP VIEW\nTERMINAL DETAILSSIDE VIEWBOTTOM VIEW\nSP3243E  Data Sheet  Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 18Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil\nQFN32\nFigure 29:  Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil, QFN32Revision: BDrawing No.: POD-00000036TYPICAL RECOMMENDED STENCILTYPICAL RECOMMENDED LAND PATTERN\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet  Mechanical Dimensions\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 19Mechanical Dimensions\nSSOP28\nFigure 30:  Mechanical Dimensions, SSOP28Drawing No.: POD-000000TOP VIEW\nTERMINAL DETAILSSIDE VIEW 2SIDE VIEW 1\nDETAIL A\n133\nSP3243E  Data Sheet  Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 20Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil\nSSOP28\nFigure 31:  Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil, SSOP28Revision: ADrawing No.: POD-000000TYPICAL RECOMMENDED STENCILTYPICAL RECOMMENDED LAND PATTERN\n133\nSP3243E  3 Driver / 5 Receiver Intelligent +3.0V to +5.5V  RS-232 Transceivers  Data Sheet  Mechanical Dimensions\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 21Mechanical Dimensions\nTSSOP28\nFigure 32:  Mechanical Dimensions, TSSOP28Revision: ADrawing No.: POD-000000TOP VIEW\nTERMINAL DETAILSSIDE VIEW 2SIDE VIEW 1\nDETAIL A©©\n©\n©\n134\nSP3243E  Data Sheet  Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 22Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil\nTSSOP28\nFigure 33:  Recommended Land Pattern and Stencil, TSSOP28Revision: ADrawing No.: POD-000000TYPICAL RECOMMENDED STENCILTYPICAL RECOMMENDED LAND PATTERN\n134\nSP3243E  Data Sheet  Ordering Information\n5/24/19  Rev 1.0.3 23Ordering Information\n1.Refer to www.maxlinear.com/SP3243E , www.maxlinear.com/SP3243EB , www.maxlinear.com/SP3243EH , www.maxlinear.com/SP3243EU for mos t up-\nto-date Ordering Information.\n2.Visit www.maxlinear.com  for additional information on Environmental Rating.Table 10:  Ordering Information(1)\nOrdering Part Number Operating Temperature Range Package Packaging Method Lead-Free(2)\n120kbps Data Rate \nSP3243ECA-L 0°C to 70°C 28-pin SSOP Tube Yes\nSP3243ECA-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243ECY-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin TSSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EEA-L -40°C to 85°C 28-pin SSOP Tube Yes\nSP3243EEA-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EEY-L -40°C to 85°C 28-pin TSSOP Tube Yes\nSP3243EEY-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin TSSOP Reel Yes\n250kbps Data Rate \nSP3243EBCA-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EBCY-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin TSSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EBEA-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EBEY-L -40°C to 85°C 28-pin TSSOP Tube Yes\nSP3243EBEY-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin TSSOP Reel Yes\n460kbps Data Rate \nSP3243EHCA-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EHEA-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\n1Mbps Data Rate \nSP3243EUCA-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EUCY-L/TR 0°C to 70°C 28-pin TSSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EUEA-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin SSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EUEY-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 28-pin TSSOP Reel Yes\nSP3243EUER-L/TR -40°C to 85°C 32-pin QFN Reel Yes\nThe content of this document is furnished for informational use only, is subject to change without notice, and should not be construed as a commitment by\nMaxLinear, Inc.
