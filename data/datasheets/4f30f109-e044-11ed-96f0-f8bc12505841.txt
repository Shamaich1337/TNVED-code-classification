This eliminates the need for \nsplitting I2C signals into separate transmit and rec eive signals for  \nuse with stand alone optocoupler s. \nThe ADuM2250  provides two bidirectional channels , supporting \na complete isolated I2C interface.  The ADuM2251 provides one \nbidirectional channel and one unidirectional channel for those \napplications where a bidirectional clock is not req uired.  \nThe ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 contain hot swap  circuitry to \nprevent data glitches when an un powered card is  inserted on to \nan active bus.  \nThese isolators are based on i Coupler ® chip scale transformer \ntechnology from Analog Devices, Inc. iCoupler is a magnetic \nisolation technology with performance, size, power consump -\ntion, and functional  advantages compared to optocouplers.  The \nADuM2250 /ADuM2251 integrate  iCoupler channels with semi -\nconductor circuitry  to enable a complete , isolated I2C interface  \nin a small form factor  package . \n \nFUNCTIONAL  BLOCK  DIAGRAMS \nDECODE ENCODE\nENCODE DECODE\nDECODE ENCODE\nENCODE DECODEGND 1\nNC\nVDD1\nNC\nSDA 1\nSCL 1\nGND 1\nNCGND 2\nNC\nVDD2\nNC\nSDA 2\nSCL 2\nGND 2NC\n06670-001875\n64321\n91012\n1113141516\nADuM2250\nNC = NO CONNECT \nFigure 1.

D | Page 10 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 interface on each side to I2C sig-\nnals. Internally, the bidirectional I2C signals are split into two \nunidirectional channels communicating in opposite directions \nvia dedicated i Coupler isolation channels. One channel of each \npair (the Side 1 input of each input/output pin in Figure 6) implements a special input buffer and output driver that can differentiate between externally generated inputs and its own output signals. It transfers only externally generated input signals to the corresponding Side 2 data or clock pin. \nBoth the Side 1 and Side 2 I\n2C pins are designed to interface to \nan I2C bus operating in the 3.0 V to 5.5 V range. A logic low on \neither side causes the corresponding input/output pin across the \ncoupler to be pulled low enough to comply with the logic low threshold requirements of other I\n2C devices on the bus. Bus \ncontention and latch-up are avoided by guaranteeing that the \ninput low threshold at SDA 1 or SCL 1 is at least 50 mV less than \nthe output low signal at the same pin. This prevents an output \nlogic low at Side 1 from being transmitted back to Side 2 and \npulling down the I2C bus by latching the state. \nBecause the Side 2 logic levels/thresholds and drive capabilities \ncomply fully with standard I2C values, multiple ADuM2250/ \nADuM2251 devices connected to a bus by their Side 2 pins can \ncommunicate with each other and with other I2C-compatible \ndevices, as shown in Figure 7. Note the distinction between I2C \ncompatibility and I2C compliance. I2C compatibility refers to situ-\nations in which the logic levels or drive capability of a component \ndo not necessarily meet the requirements of the I2C specification \nbut still allow the component to communicate with an I2C-com-\npliant device. I2C compliance refers to situations in which the \nlogic levels and drive capability of a component fully meet the \nrequirements of the I2C specification. \nBecause the Side 1 pin has a modified output level/input threshold, \nSide 1 of the ADuM2250/ ADuM2251  can communicate only with \ndevices that are fully compliant with the I2C standard. In other \nwords, Side 2 of the ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 is I2C-compliant, \nwhereas Side 1 is only I2C-compatible. \nThe Side 1 input/output pins must not be connected to other I\n2C buffers that implement a similar scheme of dual input/output \nthreshold detection. This latch-up prevention scheme is implemented in several popular I\n2C level shifting and bus \nextension products currently available from Analog Devices and other manufacturers. Care should be taken to review the \ndata sheet of potential I\n2C bus buffering products to ensure that \nonly one buffer on a bus segment implements a dual threshold \nscheme. \n   \n A bus segment is a portion of the I2C bus that is isolated from \nother portions of the bus by galvanic isolation, bus extenders, or \nlevel shifting buffers. Table 11 shows how multiple ADuM2250 / \nADuM2251 components can coexist on a bus as long as two \nSide 1 buffers are not connected to the same bus segment. \nTable 11. ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 Buffer Compatibility \n Side 1 Side 2 \nSide 1 No Yes \nSide 2 Yes Yes \nThe output logic low levels are independent of the V DD1 and \nVDD2 voltages. The input logic low threshold at Side 1 is also \nindependent of V DD1. However, the input logic low threshold at \nSide 2 is designed to be at 0.3 V DD2, consistent with I2C require-\nments. The Side 1 and Side 2 input/output pins have open-\ncollector outputs whose high levels are set via pull-up resistors to their respective supply voltages. \nDECODE ENCODE\nENCODE DECODE\nDECODE ENCODE\nENCODE DECODEGND 1\nNC\nVDD1\nNC\nSDA1\nSCL 1\nNCGND 1GND 2\nNC\nVDD2\nNC\nSDA 2\nSCL 2\nNC\nGND 2\n06670-006875\n64321\n12\n1113141516\n10ADuM2250\nSYMBOL INDICATES A DUAL THRESHOLD INPUT BUFFER.\nNC = NO CONNECT9\n \nFigure 6.

This feature  prevents  the possibility of \ninput logic low signals pulling down  the I2C bus inadvertently \nduring power -up/power -down.  \nFor the signal channels to be enabled , the following c riteria \nmust be met : \n• Both supplies must be at least 2.5 V .  \n• At least 40 μs must elapse after both supplies exceed the \ninternal start -up threshold of 2.0 V .  \nUntil both criteria are met for both supplies, the ADuM2250/  \nADuM2251 outputs are pulled high , thereby ensuring a startup \nthat avoids any disturbances on the bus.

At these lower operating speeds, the \nlimitation on the load capacitance can be significantly relaxed. \nTable 12 shows the maximum capacitance at minimum pull -up \nvalues for sta ndard and fast operating modes. If larger values for \nthe pull -up resistor are used, the maximum supported capacitance  \nmust be scaled down proportionately so that the rise time does \nnot i ncrease beyond the values required by the standard.  \nTable 12.

The limitation on the magnetic field immunity \nof the ADuM2250 /ADuM2251 is set by the condition in which \ninduced voltage in the receiving coil of the transformer is suffi-\nciently large to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following  \nanaly sis defines the conditions under which this may occur. The \n3 V operating condition of the ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 is \nexamined because it represents the most susceptible mode of \noperation.  \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at approxim ately \n0.5 V , thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages  \ncan be tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is \ngiven by  \nV = (−d β/dt) ∑ πrn2; n = 1, 2, … , N  \nwhere:  \nβ is the magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM2250/ \nADuM2251 and an imposed requirement that the induced \nvoltage be , at most , 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a \nmaximum allowable magnetic field is calculated, as shown in Figure 10. \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n06670-010MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n \nFigure 10. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maxi -\nmum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a voltage of \n0.25 V at the receiving coil. This voltage is approxim ately 50% of  \nthe sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. \nSimilarly, if such an event occur s during a transmitted pulse (and \nis of the worst -case polarity), it r educe s the received pulse from \n>1.0 V to 0.75 V —still well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of \nthe decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances away from the ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 transformers. Figure 11 expresses \nthese allowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. As shown in Figure 11, the ADuM2250/  \nADuM2251 are extremely immune and can be affected only by \nextremely large currents operated at high frequency very close to the component. For the 1 MH z example , a 0.5  kA current \nmust be placed 5 mm away from the ADuM2250/ ADuM2251 \nto affect the operation  of the c ompone nt. \nNote that at combinations of strong magnetic fields and high \nfrequencies, any loops formed by printed circuit board traces c an \ninduce error voltages sufficiently large to trigger the threshold s \nof succeeding circuitry.
