GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe CS8406 is a monolithic CMOS device which encodes a nd transmits audio data according to the AES3,\nIEC60958, S/PDIF, and EIAJ CP1201 in terface standards. The CS8406 accept s audio, channel status and user da-\nta, which is then multiplexed, encoded, and driven onto a cable.\nThe audio data is input through a configurable, 3-wire input port. The channel status bits  and user bit data are input\nthrough an SPI or I²C Mode microcontroller port and may be assembled in separate block sized buffers.For systems with no microcontroller, a Stand-Alone Mode a llows direct access to chann el status and user data input\npins.\nTarget applications include CD-R, DAT,  DVD, MD and VTR equipment, mixing  consoles, digital audio transmission\nequipment, high quality A/D converters, effects proce ssors, set-top TV boxes, and computer audio systems.\nFigure 5  shows the supply and external connections to the CS 8406 when configured for operation with a microcon-\ntroller. Figure 6  shows the supply and external connections to the CS8406 when configured for operation without a\nmicrocontroller.\n3.1 AES3 and S/PDIF Standards Documents\nThis data sheet assumes that  the user is familia r with the AES3 and S/PDIF data formats. It is advisable to\nhave current copies of the AES3 and IEC60958 specifications on hand for easy reference.\nThe latest AES3 standard is available from the Audio Engi neering Society or ANSI at www.aes.org  or\nwww.ansi.org. Obtain the latest IEC60958 standard from ANSI or from the International Electrotechnical\nCommission at www.iec.ch . The latest EIAJ CP-1201 standard is available from the Japanese Electronics\nBureau.Application Note 22: Overview of Digital Audio Interface Data Structures  contains a useful tutorial on digital\naudio specifications, but it should not be considered a substitute for the standards.\nThe paper An Understanding and Implementation of the SCMS  Serial Copy Management System for Digital\nAudio Transmission , by Clifton Sanchez, is an ex cellent tutorial on SCMS. It  is available from the AES as\nreprint 3518.\n12 DS580F6CS8406\n4. THREE-WIRE SERIAL INPUT AUDIO PORT\nA 3-wire serial audio input port is provided. The interface format can be adjusted to suit the attached device through\nthe control registers. The following parameters are adjustable: \n• Master or slave\n• Serial clock frequency\n• Audio data resolution• Left or right justification of the data relative to left/right clock\n• Optional one-bit cell delay of the first data bit• Polarity of the bit clock• Polarity of the left/right clock (by setting the app ropriate control bits, many formats are possible.) \nFigure 7  shows a selection of common input formats with the corresponding control bit settings. \nIn Master Mode, the left/right clock and the serial bit cl ock are outputs, derived from the OMCK input pin master \nclock. In Slave Mode, the left/right clock and the serial bit clock are inputs. The left/right clock must be synchronous to the\nOMCK master clock, but the serial bit clock can be asynch ronous and discontinuous if required. The left/right clock\nshould be continuous, but the duty cycle can be less than the specified typical value of  50% if enough serial clocks\nare present in each phase to clock all the data bits.\nILRCK\nISCLK\nSDIN\n2Left\nJustified\n(In)\nMSB LSBLeft Right\nMSBI  S\n(In)\nRightJustified\n(In)MSB LSB MSB LSB MSBLeft Right\nMSB LSB\nMSB LSBLeft Right\nLSB MSB LSBILRCK\nISCLK\nSDIN\nILRCK\nISCLK\nSDIN\nFigure 7.

AES3 TRANSMITTER\nThe CS8406 includes an AES3 digital audio transmitter.  A comprehensive buffering scheme provides write access\nto the channel status and user data. Th is buffering scheme is described in “Appendix B: Channel Status and User\nData Buffer Management” on page 36 .\nThe AES3 transmitter enco des and transmits audio and di gital data accordin g to the AES3, IEC60958 (S/PDIF), and\nEIAJ CP-1201 interface standards. Audio and control data are multiplexed together and bi-phase mark encoded.\nThe resulting bit stream is driven to an output connector ei ther directly or through a transformer. The transmitter is\nclocked from the clock input pin, OMCK. If OMCK is asyn chronous to the data source, an interrupt bit (TSLIP) is\nprovided that will go high every time a data sample is dropped or repeated.\nThe channel status (C) and user (U) bi ts in the transmitted data stream are taken from storage areas within the\nCS8406. The user can access the internal storage or configure the CS8406 to run in one of several automatic\nmodes. “Appendix B: Channel Status and User  Data Buffer Management” on page 36 provides detailed descriptions\nof each automatic mode and describes methods of accessing the storage areas. The transmitted user bit data canoptionally be input through the U pin, under the control of a control port register bit.\nFigures 8  and 9 show the C/U/V timing requirements.\n5.1 TXN and TXP Drivers\nThe AES3 transmitter line driv ers are low skew, lo w impedance, differential out puts capable of driving ca-\nbles directly. Both drivers are set to ground during reset (RST  = LOW), when no AES3 transmit clock is pro-\nvided, and optionally under the control of a register bit. The CS8406 also allows immediate muting of theAES3 transmitter audio data through a control register bit.\nExternal components are used to terminate and isolate the external cable from the CS8406. These compo-\nnents are detailed in “Appendix A: External AES3/SPDIF/IEC60958 Transmitte r Components”  on page 35 .\n5.2 Mono Mode Operation\nAn alternate method for tr ansmitting an AES3 192 kHz sample rate  stream is Mono M ode. Mono Mode is\nimplemented by using the two sub-frames in a 96 kH z biphase encoded stream to carry consecutive sam-\nples of a single channel of a 192 kHz PCM stream (i.e. a mono signal). This allows older equipment, whose\nAES3 transmitters and receivers are not rated for 19 2 kHz frame rate operation, to handle 192 kHz sample\nrate information. In this Mono Mode, two AES3 cables and two CS840 6\'s are needed for stereo data trans-\nfer. The CS8406 is set to Mono Mode by the MMT control bit.\nIn Mono Mode, the in put port will run at the audio sample rate (Fs), while th e AES3 transmitter frame rate\nwill be at Fs/2. Consecutive left or right channel seri al audio data samples may be  selected for transmission\non the A and B sub-frames, and the channel status block transmitted is also selectable.\nUsing Mono Mode is only necessary if the incoming a udio sample rate is already at 192 kHz and contains\nboth left and right audio data words. The “Mon o Mode” AES3 output stream may also be  achieved by keep-\ning the CS8406 in normal stereo mode, and placing cons ecutive audio samples in the left and right positions\nin an incoming 96 kHz word rate data stream. Figure 9 shows the C/U/V timing requirements.\n5.3 Transmitted Frame and Ch annel Status Boundary Timing\nThe TCBL pin is used to indicate the start of trans mitted channel stat us block boundaries and may be an\ninput or an output.In some applications, it may be necessary to contro l the precise timing of the transmitted AES3 frame\nboundaries. This may be achieved in two ways:\n14 DS580F6CS8406\na) With TCBL set to input, drivi ng TCBL high for >3 OMCK clocks will cause a frame start, as well as a new\nchannel status block start.\nb) If the serial audio input port is in Slave Mode an d TCBL is set to output, the start of the A channel sub-\nframe will be aligned with th e leading edge of ILRCK.\nThe timing of TCBL, VLRCK, C,  U, and V are illustrated in Figure 8  and Figure 9. VLRCK is the internal vir-\ntual word clock signal, and is used here only to illustra te the timing of the C, U, and V bits. In Stereo Mode\nVLRCK = AES3 frame rate an d in Mono Mode VLRCK = 2 x AES3 frame rate. If the serial audio input port\nis set to Slave Mode and TCBL is an out put, VLRCK = ILRCK when SILRPOL = 0 and VLRCK = ILRCK\nwhen SILRPOL = 1. If the serial audio input port is set to  master mode and TCBL is a n input,\nVLRCK = ILRCK when SILRPOL = 0 and VLRCK = ILRCK  when SILRPOL = 1.\n \nVCU[0] VCU[1] VCU[2] VCU[3] VCU[4]VLRCK\nV/C/U \nData [4] Data [5] Data [6] Data [7] Data [8] SDIN\nData [0] Data [1] Data [2] Data [3] Data [4] TXP(N) Z Y X Y XTsetup TholdTthTCBL\nFigure 8.

CONTROL PORT DESCRIPTION\nThe control port is used to access the registers, allowin g the CS8406 to be configured for the desired operational\nmodes and formats. The operation of the control port may be completely asynchronous with respect to the audio\nsample rates. However, to avoid potential interference proble ms, the control port pins should remain static if no op-\neration is required.\nThe control port has two modes: SPI and I²C, with the CS 8406 acting as a slave device. SPI Mode is selected if\nthere is a high to low transition on the AD0/CS  pin, after the RST  pin has been brought high. I²C Mode is selected\nby connecting the AD0/CS  pin through a resistor to VL or GND, thereby permanently selecting the desired AD0 bit\naddress state.\n6.1 SPI Mode\nIn SPI Mode, CS  is the CS8406 chip select signal, CCLK is th e control port bit clock (input into the CS8406\nfrom the microcontroller), CDIN is the input data line from the microcontroller, and CDOUT is the output data\nline to the microcontroller. Data is clocked in on the rising edge of CCLK and out on the falling edge.\nFigure 10  shows the operation of the control port in SPI Mode. To write to a register, bring CS  low. The first\nseven bits on CDIN form the chip address and must  be 0010000. The eighth bit is a read/write indicator\n(R/W ), which should be low to write.  The next eight bits form the Me mory Address Pointer (MAP), which is\nset to the address of the r egister that is to be upda ted. The next eight bits are the data which will be placed\ninto the register designated by the MAP. During writes, the CDOUT output stays in the Hi-Z state. It may be\nexternally pulled high or low with a 47 k \uf057 resistor, if desired. \nTo read a register, the MAP has to be set to the correct address by executing a partial write cycle which\nfinishes (CS  high) immediately after the MAP byte. To begin a read, bring CS  low, send out the chip address\nand set the read/write bit (R/W ) high. The next falling edge of CCLK will clock out the MSB of the addressed\nregister (CDOUT will leave th e high impedance state). The MAP automa tically increments so data for suc-\ncessive registers will appear consecutively.\nMAP\nMSB LSBDATA\nbyte 1 byte nR/W R/WADDRESSCHI P\nADDRESSCHI P\nCDI NCCLKCS\nCDOUTMSB LSB MSB LSB0010000 0010000\nMAP = Memory Address Pointer, 7 bits, MSB firstHigh Impedance\nFigure 10.  Control Port Timing in SPI Mode\nDS580F6 17CS8406\n6.2 I²C Mode\nIn I²C Mode, SDA is a bidirectional data  line. Data is clock ed in to and out of the part by the clock, SCL. There\nis no CS  pin. Pins AD0, AD1, and AD2 form the three leas t significant bits of the chip address and should\nbe connected to VL or GND as desired.\nThe signal timing for both a read and write cycle are shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12. A Start condition is\ndefined as a falling transition of SDA while the clock is high. A Stop condit ion is a rising transition while the\nclock is high. All other transitions of SDA occur while the clock is low. The first byte sent to the CS8406 after\na Start condition consists of a 7 bit chip address field and a R/W  bit (high for a read, low for a write). The\nupper 4 bits of the 7-bit address field are fixed at 0010. To communi cate with a CS8406, the chip address\nfield, which is the first by te sent to the CS8406, should match 0010 followed by the settings of the AD2, AD1,\nand AD0 pins. The eighth bit of the address is the R/W  bit. If the operation is a write, the next byte is the\nMemory Address Pointer (MAP) which se lects the register to be read or wr itten. If the op eration is a read,\nthe contents of the register pointed  to by the MAP will be output. Th e MAP automatically increments, so\nconsecutive registers can read from or written to ea sily. Each byte is separated by an acknowledge bit\n(ACK). The ACK bit is output from the CS8406 after each  input byte is read, and is input to the CS8406 from\nthe microcontroller after each transmitted byte. \nSince the read operation cannot set the MAP, an aborte d write operation is used as a preamble. As shown\nin Figure 12 , the write operation is aborted after the acknowledge for the MAP by sending a stop condition. 4     5     6     7   24  25\nSCL\n0    0    1     0   AD2 AD1 AD0   0CHIP ADDRESS (WRITE) MAP DATA DATA +1     \nSTARTACK\nSTOPACK ACK ACKSDA 6     5     4     3     2     1 7     6         1    0 7     6         1    0 7    6     1    0 0     1     2     3   8     9   12   16   17  18    19   10   11   13   14  15   27   2826\nDATA +n     \nFigure 11.

In SPI Mode, CDIN is the input data line for the control port interface.\nAD2 3Address Bit 2 (I²C Mode)  (Input ) - Determines the AD2 address bit for the control port in I²C Mode, and \nshould be connected to GND or VL. If SPI Mode is used, the AD2 pin should be connected to either \nGND or VL.\nRXP 4Auxiliary AES3 Receiver Port  (Input ) - Input for an altern ate, already AES3 coded , audio data source.\nINT 19Interrupt  (Output ) - Indicates key events during the operation of the CS8406. All bits affecting INT may \nbe unmasked through bits in the control registers. Indica tion of the condition(s) that initiated an interrupt \nare readable in the control registers. The polarity of the INT output, as well as selection of a standard or \nopen drain output, is set through a control register. On ce set true, the INT pin goes false only after the \ninterrupt status registers have been read and the interrupt status bits have returned to zero.\nTCBL 15Transmit Channel Status Block Start (Input /Output ) - When operated as output, TCBL is high during \nthe first sub-frame of a transmitted channel status bl ock, and low at all other times. When operated as \ninput, driving TCBL high for at least three OMCK clocks will cause the next transmitted sub-frame to be \nthe start of a channel status block.\nU 20User  Data  (Input ) - May optionally be used to input User data  for transmission by the AES3 transmitter, \nsee Figure 4  for timing information. If not driven, a 47 k \uf057 pull-down resistor is recommended for the U \npin. If the U pin is driven by a logic level output, a 100 \uf057 series resistor is recommended.\nTSTN 5Test In  (Input ) - This pin is an input used for test purposes.  It must be tied to ground for normal operation.\nTEST7\n8\n10\n11\n1617\n18Test Pins  - These pins are unused inputs. It is recomm ended that these pins be tied to a supply (VL or \nGND) to minimize leakage current. The CS8406 will opera te correctly if these pins  are left floating, how-\never current consumption fr om VL will increase by 25 \uf06dA per TEST pin that is left floating.\nDS580F6 27CS8406\n10.HARDWARE MODE\nThe CS8406 has a Hardware Mode that allows the use of the device without a microcontroller. Hardware Mode is\nselected by connecting the H/S  pin to VL. The flexibility of the CS8406 is necessarily limited  in Hardware Mode.\nVarious pins change function as described in the Hardware Mode pin description section.\nThe Hardware Mode data flow is shown in Figure 13. Audio data is input through the serial audio input port and rout-\ned to the AES3 transmitter. \n10.1 Channel Status, Us er and Validity Data\nThe transmitted channel status, user and validity data can be input in two methods, determined by the state\nof the CEN pin. Mode A is selected when the CEN pin is  low. In Mode A, the user bit data and the validity\nbit are input through the U and V pins , clocked by both edges of  ILRCK. The channel status data is derived\nfrom the state of the COPY/C, ORIG, EMPH , and AUDIO  pins. Table 2  shows how the COPY/C and ORIG\npins map to channel status bits. In Consumer Mode, the transmitted category code is set to General (00h).\nMode B is selected when the CEN pin is high. In Mode B, the channel status, user data bits and the validity\nbit are input serially through the COPY/C, U and V pins. Data is clocked into these pins at both edges ofILRCK. Figure 9  shows the timing requirements. \nAES3\nEncoder\n&T xSerial\nAudio\nInput\nC, U, V Data BufferILRCK\nISCLKTXP\nCOPY/C ORIG EMPH AUDIOVL\nH/SOutput\nClock\nSource\nOMCK\nPower supply pins are omitted from this diagram.\nPlease refer to the Typical Connection Diagram for hook-up details.SDIN\nSFMT1 SFMT0TXN\nCEN\nU\nV\nAPMSTCBLTCBLDRST\nFigure 13.

This is particularly true in Hardware Mode with multiple CS8406 devices, where \nsynchronization between devices is important.\nH/S 24Hardware/Software Control Mode Select  (Input ) - Determines the method of controlling the operation \nof the CS8406, and the method of accessing CS and U data. Hardware Mode provides an alternate \nmode of operation, and access to CS and U data is  provided by dedicated pins.

When operated as \ninput, driving TCBL high for at least three OMCK clocks will cause the next transmitted sub-frame to be \nthe start of a channel status block.\nCEN 16C Bit Enable  (Input ) - Determines how the channel status data bits are input. When CEN is low, Hard-\nware Mode A is selected, where the COPY/C, ORIG, EMPH\n and AUDIO  pins are used to enter selected \nchannel status data. When CEN is high, Hardware Mode B is selected, where the COPY/C pin is used \nto enter serial channel status data.\nV 17Validity Bit  (Input ) - In Hardware Modes A and B, the V pin in put determines the state of the validity bit \nin the outgoing AES3 tran smitted data. This pin is samp led on both edges of the ILRCK.\nU 18User Data Bit  (Input ) - In Hardware Modes A and B, the U pin input determines the state of the user \ndata bit in the outgoing AES3 transm itted data.

In Hardware Mode B, the COPY/C pin becomes the direct C bit input data pin, \nwhich is sampled on both edges of LRCK.\nEMPH 3Pre-Emphasis Indicator  (Input ) - In Hardware Mode A (CEN = 0), the EMPH  pin low sets the 3 empha-\nsis channel status bits to indicate 50/15 \uf06ds pre-emphasis of the transmitted audio data. If EMPH  is high, \nthen the three EMPH  channel status bits are set to 000, indicating no pre-emphasis.\nAUDIO 19Audio Channel Status Bit  (Input ) - In Hardware Mode A (CEN = 0), the AUDIO  pin determines the \nstate of the audio/non audio Channel Status  bit in the outgoing AES3 data stream.\nORIG 28ORIG Channel Status Bit Control (Input ) - In Hardware Mode A (CEN  = 0), the ORIG and COPY/C \npins determine the state of the Copyright, Pro, and  L Channel Status bits in the outgoing AES3 data \nstream, see Table 2 on page 28 .\nTEST27\n8Test Pins  (Input ) - These pins are unused inputs. It is recomm ended that these pins be tied to a supply \n(VL or GND) to minimize leakage current. The CS8406 will operate correctly if t hese pins are left float-\ning, however current consumption from VL will increase by 25 \uf06dA per TEST pin that is left floating.\nDS580F6 31CS8406\n12.APPLICATIONS\n12.1 Reset, Power Down and Start-Up \nWhen RST  is low, the CS8406 enters a low power mode and all internal states are reset, including the con-\ntrol port and registers, and the outputs ar e disabled. In Software Mode when RST  is high, the control port\nbecomes operational and the desired settings should be loa ded into the control registers. Writing a 1 to the\nRUN bit will then cause the part to leave the low power  state and begin operation.  In Hardware Mode when\nRST is high, the part will auto matically leave the low power  state and begin operation.\n12.2 ID Code and Revision Code\nThe CS8406 has a register that contai ns a four-bit code to indicate that the addressed device is a CS8406.\nThis is useful when other CS84XX family members ar e resident in the same or similar syste ms, allowing\ncommon software modules.\nThe CS8406 four-bit revision level co de is also available. This allows the software driver for the CS8406 to\nidentify which revision of the device is in a particular system, and modify its behavior accordingly. To allow\nfor future revisions, it is strongly recommended that the revision code is read into a variable area within the\nmicrocontroller, and used wherever appropriate as revision details become known.\n12.3 Power Supply, Ground ing, and PCB layout\nThe CS8406 operates from a VD = +3.3 V or +5.0 V and VL = +3.3 V or +5.0 V supply. These supplied maybe set independently. Follow normal supply decoupling practices, see Figures 5  and 6. The VD and VL sup-\nplies should be decoupled with a 0.1\n\uf06dF capacitor to GND to minimize AES3 transmitter induced transients.\nExtensive use of power and ground planes, ground plane fill in unused areas and surface mount decoupling\ncapacitors are recommended. Decoupling capacitors should be mounted on the same side of the board asthe CS8406 to minimize inductance effects, and all deco upling capacitors should be as close to the CS8406\nas possible.\n12.4 Synchronization of Multiple CS8406s\nThe AES3 transmitters of multiple CS 8406s can be synchronized  if all devices share the same master clock,\nTCBL, and RST  signals. The TCBL pin is used to synchron ize multiple CS8406 AES3  transmitters at the\nchannel status block boundaries. One CS8406 must have  its TCBL set to master; the others must be set to\nslave TCBL. Alternatively, TCBL can be derived from external logic, whereby all CS8406 devices should be\nset to slave TCBL.\n32 DS580F6CS8406\n13.PACKAGE DIMENSIONS  \nINCHES MILLIMETERS\nDIM MIN NOM MAX MIN NOM MAX\nA 0.093 0.098 0.104 2.35 2.50 2.65\nA1 0.004 0.008 0.012 0.10 0.20 0.30\nb 0.013 0.017 0.020 0.33 0.42 0.51\nC 0.009 0.011 0.013 0.23 0.28 0.32\nD 0.697 0.705 0.713 17.70 17.90 18.10\nE 0.291 0.295 0.299 7.40 7.50 7.60\ne 0.040 0.050 0.060 1.02 1.27 1.52\nH 0.394 0.407 0.419 10.00 10.34 10.65\nL 0.016 0.026 0.050 0.40 0.65 1.27\nµ 0 °4 °8 °0 °4 °8 °\nJEDEC #: MS-013\nControlling Dimension is Millimeters28L SOIC (300 MIL BODY) PACKAGE DRAWING\nDH E\nb\nA1Ac\nL\uf0b5\nSEATING\nPLANE1\ne\nDS580F6 33CS8406\nNotes:\n1. “D” and “E1” are reference datums and do not inclu ded mold flash or protrusions, but do include mold\nmismatch and are measured at the parting line, mold  flash or protrusions shall not exceed 0.20 mm per\nside.\n2.

The\nAES3 and IEC60958-4 specifications call for a balanced output drive of 2-7 V peak-to-peak into a 110 \uf057 ±\n20% load with no cable attached. Using the circuit in Figure 14 , the output of the transformer is short-circuit\nprotected, has the p roper source impedance, and provides a 5 V peak-to-peak signal into a 110 \uf057 load.\nLastly, the two output pins should be attached to an XLR connector with male pins and a female shell, andwith pin 1 of the connector grounded.\nIn the case of consumer use, the IEC60958-3 specification calls for an unbalanced drive circuit with an out-\nput impedance of 75\n\uf057± 20% and a output drive level of 0.5 V peak-to-peak ± 20% when measured across\na 75\uf057 load using no cable. The circuit shown in Figure 15  only uses the TXP pin and provides the proper\noutput impedance and drive level using standard 1% resistors. If VL is se t to +3.3 V, change 374 \uf057\uf020to 243\uf057\nand change 90.9 \uf057 to 107\uf057. The connector for a consumer application would be an RCA phono socket.\nThis circuit is also short circuit protected.\nThe TXP pin may be used to drive TTL or CMOS gates as shown in Figure 16 . This circuit may be used for\noptical connectors for digital audio since they usually have TTL or CMOS compatible inputs. This circuit is\nalso useful when driving multiple digital audio output s since RS422 line drivers have TTL compatible inputs. \n15.2 Isolating Transformer Requirements\nPlease refer to the application note AN134: AES and SPDIF Recommended Transformers  for resources on\ntransformer selection.\n 374-RTXP\n90.9\uf057TXP\nTXNRCA\nPhonoCS8406110-(R TXP+R TXN)\nTXP\nTXNXLR\nPin 1CS8406\nFigure 14.

The user ma y read from or write to these RAM buffers through the\ncontrol port. \nThe CS8406 manages the flow of channel  status data at the block level, meaning that entire blocks of chan-\nnel status information are buffered at the input, synchronized to the output timebase, and then transmitted.\nThe buffering scheme involves a cascade of 2 bl ock-sized buffers, named E and F, as shown in Figure 17 .\nThe MSB of each byte represents the first bit in the serial C data stream. For example, the MSB of byte 0\n(which is at control port address 20h) is the co nsumer/professional bit for channel status block A.\nThe E buffer is accessible from the control port, allowing read and writing of the C data. The F buffer is usedas the source of C data for the AES3  transmitter. The F buffer accepts block tran sfers from the E buffer.\n16.1.1 Accessing the E buffer\nThe user can monitor the data being transferred by re ading the E buffer, which is mapped into the register\nspace of the CS8406, through the control port. The user can modify the data to be transmitted by writingto the E buffer.\nThe user can configure the interrupt enable register to cause interrupts to occur whenever “E to F” buffer\ntransfers occur. This allows determination of the a llowable time periods to interact with the E buffer.\nAlso provided is an “E to F” inhibit bit. The “E to F” buffer transfer is disabled whenever the user sets this\nbit. This may be used whenever “long” control port interactions are occurring. \nA flowchart for reading and writing to the E buffer is shown in Figure 18 . For writing, the sequence starts\nafter a E to F transfer, which is  based on the output timebase.\nIf the channel status block to transmit indicates PRO Mode, then the CRCC byte is automatically calcu-\nlated by the CS8406, and does not have to be written in to the last byte of the block by the host microcon-Control PortTo\nAES3TransmitterE\n24\nwords8-bits 8-bitsAB\nF\nTransmitData\nBuffer\nFigure 17.  Channel Status Data Buffer Structure\nDS580F6 37CS8406\ntroller. This is also true if the channel status data is entered serially through the COPY/C pin when the part\nis in Hardware Mode.\n16.1.2 Serial Copy Mana gement System (SCMS)\nIn Software Mode, the CS8406 allows  read/modify/write access to all the channel status bits. For Con-\nsumer Mode SCMS compliance, the host microcontro ller needs to manipulate the Category Code, Copy\nbit and L bit appropriately.\nIn Hardware Mode, the SCMS protocol can be followed by either using the COPY and ORIG input pins,\nor by using the C bit serial input pin. These options are documented in the Hardware Mode section of thisdata sheet.\n16.1.3 Channel Status Data E Buffer Access\nThe E buffer is organized as 24 x 16-bit words. For each word the MS Byte is the A channel data, and the\nLS Byte is the B channel data (see Figure 17 ).\nThere are two methods of accessing this memory, known as One-Byte Mode and Two-Byte Mode. The\ndesired mode is selected through a control register bit.\n16.1.3.1 One-Byte Mode\nIn many applications, the ch annel status blocks for the A and B channels will be iden tical. In this situation,\nif the user reads a byte from one of the channel\'s bl ocks, the corresponding byte for the other channel will\nbe the same. Similarly, if the user wrote a byte to o ne channel\'s block, it would be necessary to write the\nsame byte to the other block. One-Byte Mode takes ad vantage of the often identical nature of A and  B chan-\nnel status data.\nWhen reading data in One-Byte Mode, a single byte is returned, which can be from channel A or B data,\ndepending on a register control bit. If a write is being done, the CS8406 expects a single byte to be inputto its control port. This byte will be written to  both the A and B locations in the addressed word.\nOne-Byte Mode saves the user substant ial control port access time, as it  effectively accesses 2 bytes worth\nof information in 1 byte\'s worth of access time. If th e control port\'s auto increment addressing is used in\ncombination with this mode, multi-byte accesses such as full-block reads or writes can be done especiallyefficiently.Et oFi n t e r r u p to c c u r s\nOptionally set E to F inhibit\nIf set, clear E to F inhibit\nReturnWrite E data\nWait for E to F transfer\nFigure 18.  Flowchart for Writing the E Buffer\n38 DS580F6CS8406\n16.1.3.2 Two-Byte Mode\nThere are those applications in wh ich the A and B channel status blo cks will not be the same, and the user\nis interested in accessing both blocks. In these situat ions, Two-Byte Mode should be used to access the E\nbuffer. \nIn this mode, a read will cause the CS 8406 to output two bytes from its control port.  The first byte out will\nrepresent the A channel status data, and the 2nd byte will represent the B channel status data. Writing is\nsimilar, in that two bytes must now be input to the CS 8406\'s control port. The A channel status data is first;\nB channel status data second.\n16.2 AES3 User (U) Bit Management\nThe CS8406 U bit manager has two operating modes:\nMode 1. Transmit all zeros.Mode 2. Block mode.\n16.2.1 Mode 1: Transmit All Zeros\nMode 1 causes only zeros to be transmitted in the output U data, regardless of E buffer contents. Thismode is intended for the user who wants the output U channel to contain no data.\n16.2.2 Mode 2: Block Mode\nMode 2 is very similar to the scheme used to contro l the C bits. Entire blocks of U data are buffered using\n2 block-sized RAMs to perform the buffering. The user  has access to the first buffer, denoted the E buffer,\nthrough the control port. It is the only mode in which the user can merge his own U data into the transmit-ted AES3 data stream. The U buffer access only operates in  Two-Byte Mode, since there is no concept\nof A and B blocks for user data. The ar rangement of the data is as followings: Bit15[A7] Bit14[B7]Bit13[A6] Bit12 [B6]...Bit1 [A 0] Bit0[B0]. The arrangement of the data in the each byte is that the MSB is\nthe first transmitted bit. The bit for the A subf rame is followed by the bit for the B subframe.\nDS580F6 39CS8406\n17.REVISION HISTORY  \nRelease Date Changes\nF3 July 2005-Updated Packaging Information to include Lead Free devices and updated “Table of \nContents” on page 2 .\nF4 April 2006-Removed references to “Autoincrement” feature in “Control Port Description” on \npage 16 .
