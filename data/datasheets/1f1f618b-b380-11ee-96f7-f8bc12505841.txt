The AL5812 simplifies the design of linear and isolated or non-isolated LED drivers by setting the LED current with standard value resistors.   \nThe AL5812 has an open drain output that can swing from 1V up to \n60V enabling it drive long LED chains. Its low 0.5V R\nSET pin is outside \nof the LED current path and so accuracy is maintained while minimizing the required overheads to regulate the LED current. This \nreduces its power dissipation w hen compared to traditional linear \nLED drivers.  This makes it ideal for driving LEDs up to 150mA (commonly referred to as ½W LEDs). \nLonger LED chains can be driven by tapping V\nCC from the chain, \nwhere the chain voltage may exceed 60V. \nThe AL5812 is available in the exposed pad MSOP-8EP and \nU-DFN3030-6 packages. \n  \n \nFeatures \n\uf0b7 Low Reference Voltage (V RSET = 0.5V) \n\uf0b7 -40°C to +125°C Temperature Range \n\uf0b7 ±3% LED Current Tolerance \n\uf0b7 Low Temperature Drift \n\uf0b7 1V to 60V Open-Drain Output \n\uf0b7 High Power Supply Rejection \n\uf0b7 MSOP-8EP and U-DFN3030-6  \n\uf0b7 Totally Lead-Free & Fully RoHS Compliant (Notes 1 & 2) \n\uf0b7 Halogen and Antimony Free. “Green” Device (Note 3)  Pin Assignments \n \n \n \n \n \nApplications \n\uf0b7 Isolated Offline LED Converters \n\uf0b7 Linear LED Driver \n\uf0b7 LED Signs \n\uf0b7 Instrumentation Illumination \n \n \n \n   \n \n \nNotes: 1.

The LED current is set by the use of an external resistor, R\nSET, connected from the R SET pin to GND.  This resistor supplies the bias current of the \nAL5812 together with current regulator to set the LED current.  \n \nThe nominal LED current is determined by this equation:  \nSETLEDR5.0* 1500 I\uf03d  where 1500 is the current ratio between the LED pin current and R SET pin current. \nWith R SET = 7.5k \nmA100k5.75.0* 1500 ILED \uf03d \uf03d  \n \nThe AL5812 with its 60V capability on its supply pin, V CC, and its LED drive pin allows it to operate from supply rails up to 60V and/or directly \ndrive LED chains up to 60V as shown in Fi gures 13 and 14. The voltage applied to the V CC pin can be greater or lower than the voltage applied \nto the LED string. Figure 14 shows where you might control it from a 5-V rail but power the rails from a 12V rail. \n \nFigure 13  Low Side Current LED Setting  \n \nFigure 14  Low Side Drive – Separate Supplies  \n \n  \nAL5812VCC LED\nGND RSET\nRSET= 4.99kΩVIN\nCIN0.1µFVLED\n \nAL5812  \nDocument number: DS35616 Rev. 4 - 2  8 of 13 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AL5812\n \nApplication Information (cont.)  \n \nHigh Voltage Operation \nAn extension of Figure 14 is to derive the power for the AL5812 from the LED chain itself see Figure 15. LED chains greater tha n 60V can be \ndriven in this manner as long PWM dimming is not utilized. \n \nFigure 15  Low Side LED String Tapping  \n      \nFigure 16  High Side Current LED String   \n \nFigure 15 shows the use of RC delay to match the power time delay between Vcc and LED pin. The AL5812 can also be used on the h igh side of \nthe LEDs, see Figure 16. This is a simple  way of extending the maximum LED chain voltage, however, it does increase the minimum  system input \nvoltage to: \n V IN(min) = V LED_CHAIN  + 3.5V. \nWhere  \n V LED_CHAIN  is the LED chain voltage. \n  \n\n \nAL5812  \nDocument number: DS35616 Rev. 4 - 2  9 of 13 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AL5812\n \nApplication Information (cont.)  \n \nPWM Dimming \nThe AL5812 can be used to provide LE D current dimming driving the R SET pin via the current setting resistor (R SET) and a series MOSFET switch \nto ground (Figure 17). The R SET pin current is then effectively switched on and off caus ing the LED current to turn on and off. The linearity is \nshown in Figure 18. \n \n \n \nFigure 17  PWM Dimming \n \nThermal Considerations \n \nWhen designing linear LED drivers carefu l consideration must be given to: \n1. the power dissipation within the LED driver  \nand  \n2. PCB layout/heat sinking.  \n \nA Linear LED driver has to be able to handle the large potential input voltage variations due to the supply voltage tolerance a nd also the variation \nin LED forward voltage due to binning and temperature. \n This can result in a large potential difference across the LED dr iver resulting in a larger than anticipated power dissipation.  \n \nFor example in an 12V powered system with a 5% output voltage tolerance; the input voltage could typically vary from 12.6V down  to 11.4V \ndriving 3 LEDs with a voltage varying from 3V to 3.5V at 100mA.  This means that the LED driver has to cope with a voltage drop across varying \nfrom approximately 3.6V to 0.9V. This means that the power dissipation of the AL5812 could be as much as 366mW. \n \nFigure 19 below shows how the AL5812’s power dissipation capability va ries with package; these values will vary with PCB size a nd area of \nmetal associated with the ground plane used for heat sinking. By increasing the area on the top layer the thermal impedance of both packages \ncould be improved. \n \n \nT =  + 2 5 ° C\n2 LEDs\nR  = 7.5k\nf = 500HzA\nSET\nPWM \uf057\n10 2009 0 1 0 0 80 40 50 30 70 60\nDUTY CYCLE (%)\nFigure 18  PWM Dimming Linearity110\n100\n90\n80\n70\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0LED CURRENT (mA)\n-40 -25 -10 5 20 35 50 65 80 95 110 125\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (C)\nFigure 19  Power Dissipation Derating1.6\n1.4\n0.2\n0.00.6\n0.41.0\n0.81.2POWER DISSIPATION (W)U-DFN3030-6\nMSOP-8EP\n \nAL5812  \nDocument number: DS35616 Rev. 4 - 2  10 of 13 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AL5812\n \nOrdering Information \n \n \n \nDevice Package Code Packaging 7”/13” Tape and Reel \nQuantity Part Number Suffix \nAL5812MP-13 MP MSOP-8EP 2500/Tape & Reel -13 \nAL5812FF-7 FF U-DFN3030-6 3000/Tape & Reel -7 \n \n \nMarking Information \n \n(1) MSOP-8EP \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(2) U-DFN3030-6 \n \n \nXX : Identification Code( Top View )\n X : A~Z : Green XYX X\nW Y : Year : 0~9\n W : Week : A~Z : 1~26 week;\n a~z : 27~52 week; z represents\n52 and 53 week\n \n \n \nPart Number Package Identification Code \nAL5812FF-7 U-DFN3030-6 B9 \n \n  AL5812 XX - XX\nPackage\nFF : U-DFN3030-6\nMP : MSOP-8EPPacking\n7 : 7” Tape & Reel\n13 : 13” Tape & Reel\nA~Z : Green\nMSOP-8EP\nY : Year : 0~9\nW : Week: A~Z : 1~26 week;\na~z : 27~52 week;\nz represents 52 and 53 week(Top View)\nLogo\nPart Number8765\nYWXE\nAL5812\n1234\n \nAL5812  \nDocument number: DS35616 Rev. 4 - 2  11 of 13 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AL5812\n \nPackage Outline Dimensions (All dimensions in mm.)   \nPlease see AP02002 at http://www.diodes.com /datasheets/ap02002.pdf for latest version.  \n \n(1) MSOP-8EP \n \n \n            \n \n \n(2) U-DFN3030-6 \n \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n  MSOP-8EP \nDim Min Max Typ \nA - 1.10 - \nA1 0.05 0.15 0.10\nA2 0.75 0.95 0.86\nA3 0.29 0.49 0.39\nb 0.22 0.38 0.30\nc 0.08 0.23 0.15\nD 2.90 3.10 3.00\nD1 1.60 2.00 1.80\nE 4.70 5.10 4.90\nE1 2.90 3.10 3.00\nE2 1.30 1.70 1.50\nE3 2.85 3.05 2.95\ne - - 0.65\nL 0.40 0.80 0.60\na 0° 8° 4° \nx - - 0.750\ny - - 0.750\nAll Dimensions in mm \nU-DFN3030-6 \nDim Min Max Typ \nA 0.57 0.63 0.60 \nA1  0 0.05 0.02 \nA3  - - 0.15 \nb 0.35 0.45 0.40 \nD 2.95 3.05 3.00 \nD2 2.25 2.45 2.35 \nE 2.95 3.05 3.00 \nE2 1.48 1.68 1.58 \ne - - 0.95 \nL 0.35 0.45 0.40 \nZ - - 0.35 \nAll Dimensions in mm 1\nDAA1\nA2E\neyx\nSeating PlaneGauge Plane\nLD\n8Xb\nSee Detail CDetail C\nca\nE1E3\nA3E24X10°\n4X10°0.25D1\nD\nD2E\ne\nbLE2AA3︵Pin #1 ID︶Seating Plane\nZ︵4x︶A1\n45°︵0.35*0.35︶\n \nAL5812  \nDocument number: DS35616 Rev. 4 - 2  12 of 13 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AL5812\n \nSuggested Pad Layout  \nPlease see AP02001 at http://www.diodes.com/ datasheets/ap02001.pdf for latest version. \n \n(1) MSOP-8EP \n  \n \n \n \n  \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n(2) U-DFN3030-6 \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n      \n \n     \n \n   Dimensions Value \n(in mm) \nC 0.650 \nG 0.450 \nX 0.450 \nX1 2.000 \nY 1.350 \nY1 1.700 \nY2 5.300 \nDimensionsValue \n(in mm) \nC 0.950 \nX 0.500 \nX1 2.400 \nX2 2.550 \nY 0.600 \nY1 1.780 \nY2 3.300 GX C\nY\nY2 Y1\nX1\nX2\nY1\nYC\nY2X1\nXC-0.409\n \nAL5812  \nDocument number: DS35616 Rev. 4 - 2  13 of 13 \nwww.diodes.com  March 2014\n© Diodes Incorporated  \n AL5812\n \nIMPORTANT NOTICE \n \nDIODES INCORPORATED MAKES NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH REGARDS TO THIS DOCUMENT, \nINCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF  MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE \n(AND THEIR EQUIVALENTS UNDER THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION).   \n \nDiodes Incorporated and its subsidiaries rese rve the right to make modifications, enhanc ements, improvements, corrections or ot her changes \nwithout further notice to this document and any product descri bed herein.
