A ferroelectric random\naccess memory or F-RAM is nonvolatile, which means that datais retained after power is remov ed. It provides data retention for\nover 151 years while eliminating the reliability concerns,\nfunctional disadvantages, and system design complexities ofbattery-backed SRAM (BBSRAM).  Fast write timing and high\nwrite endurance make the F-RAM superior to other types of\nmemory. \nThe FM28V100 operation is similar to that of other RAM devices\nand therefore, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for a\nstandard SRAM in a system. Re ad and write cycles may be\ntriggered by chip enable or simply by changing the address. TheF-RAM memory is nonvolatile due to its unique ferroelectric\nmemory process. These features  make the FM28V100 ideal for\nnonvolatile memory applications requiring frequent or rapidwrites. \nThe device is available in a 32-pin TSOP I surface mount\npackage. Device specificatio ns are guaranteed over the\nindustrial temperature range –40 °C to +85 °C.\nFor a complete list of re lated documentation, click here.\nLogic Block Diagram\nAddress Latch \nCE\nControl \nLogicWE\nRow DecoderA\nI/O Latch & Bus Driver OEDQ128 K x 8\nF-RAM Array. . .\nColumn Decoder. . .16-3\nA2-0\n7-0A16-0\n1, CE2\nFM28V100\nDocument Number: 001-86202 Rev. *G Page 2 of 18Contents\nPinout ........................................................ ........................3\nPin Definitions ............................................... ...................3\nDevice Operation .............................................. ................4\nMemory Operation ............. ................................. .........4\nRead Operation ................................................ ...........4\nWrite Operation ............................................... ............4\nPage Mode Operation ........................................... ......4\nPre-charge Operation .......................................... ........4\nSRAM Drop-In Replacement ...................................... .5\nMaximum Ratings ............................................... ..............6\nOperating Range ............................................... ................6\nDC Electrical Characteristics ................................. .........6\nData Retention and Endurance .................................. .....7\nCapacitance ................................................... ...................7\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ..............7\nAC Test Conditions ............................................ ..............7\nAC Switching Characteristics .................................. .......8\nSRAM Read Cycle ............................................... .......8SRAM Write Cycle .............................................. ......... 9\nPower Cycle Timing ............................................ ........... 12\nFunctional Truth Table ........................................ ........... 13\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 14\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 14\nPackage Diagrams .............................................. ............ 15\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 16\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 16\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 16\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 17\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 1 8\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 18\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 18\nPSoC® Solutions ............................................... ....... 18\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 18\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 18\nFM28V100\nDocument Number: 001-86202 Rev. *G Page 3 of 18Pinout\nFigure 1.  32-pin TSOP I pinout\nA0DQ0DQ1DQ2DQ7A10\nDQ6\nDQ3DQ5\nA1WE\nVDD\nA16\nA14\nA12\nA7\nA6\nA5A11\nA9\nA8\nA13\n32-pin TSOP I\n(x 8)\nTop view\n(not to scale)1\n2\n3\n4\n13\n145\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n20\n1923\n22\n2125\n2428\n27\n2630\n2932\n31\n15\n1618\n17 A4NC\nA2VSSDQ4CE2\nA15\nA3CE1OE\n[1]\nPin Definitions\nPin Name I/O Type Description\nA16–A0 Input Address inputs : The 17 address lines select one of 131,072 bytes in the F-RAM  array.

All data written to the p art is\nimmediately nonvolatile with no delay. The device offers page\nmode operation, which provides high-speed access to\naddresses within a page (row). Access to a different page\nrequires that either chip enable transitions LOW or the upperaddress (A\n16–A3) changes. See the  Functional Truth Table on\npage 13  for a complete description of read and write modes.\nMemory Operation\nUsers access 131,072 memory locations, each with 8 data bits\nthrough a parallel interface. The F-RAM array is organized as\n16,384 rows and each row has eight column locations, whichallow fast access in page mode operation. When an initial\naddress is latched by the falling edge of CE\n1 (while CE2 is HIGH),\nor the rising edge of CE2 (while CE1 is LOW), subsequent\ncolumn locations may be accessed without the need to toggle\nchip enable. When chip enable pin is deasserted HIGH, a\npre-charge operation begins. Writes occur immediately at theend of the access with no delay. The WE\n pin must be toggled for\neach write operation. The write data is stored in the nonvolati le\nmemory array immediately, which is a feature unique to F-RAMcalled NoDelay writes. \nRead Operation\nA read operation begins on the falling edge of CE1 (while CE2 is\nHIGH), or the rising edge of CE2 (while CE1 is LOW). The chip\nenable initiated access causes the address to be latched and\nstarts a memory read cycle if WE  is HIGH. Data becomes\navailable on the bus after the access time is met. When the\naddress is latched and the access completed, a new access to\na random location (different row) may begin while both chipenables are still active. The minimum cycle time for random\naddresses is t\nRC. Note that unlike SRAMs, the FM28V100’s chip\nenable-initiated access time is faster than the address accesstime.\nThe FM28V100 will drive the data bus when OE\n is asserted LOW\nand the memory acce ss time is met. If OE  is asserted after the\nmemory access time is met, the data bus will be driven with val id\ndata. If OE  is asserted before completing the memory access,\nthe data bus will not be driven until valid data is available. This\nfeature minimizes supply curre nt in the system by eliminating\ntransients caused by invalid dat a being driven to the bus. When\nOE is deasserted HIGH, the data bus will remain in a HI-Z state. \nWrite Operation\nIn the FM28V100, writes occur in the same interval as reads. Th e\nFM28V100 supports both chip enable and WE  controlled write\ncycles. In both cases, the addres s is latched on the falling ed ge\nof CE1 (while CE2 is HIGH), or the rising edge of CE2 (while CE1\nis LOW).\nIn a chip enable-controlled write, the WE  signal is asserted\nbefore beginning the memory cycle. That is, WE  is LOW whenthe device is activated with the chip enable. In this case, the\ndevice begins the memory cycle as a write. The FM28V100 willnot drive the data bus regardless of the state of OE\n as long as\nWE is LOW. Input data must be valid when the device is\ndeselected with a chip enable. In a WE -controlled write, the\nmemory cycle begins when the devi ce is activated with a chip\nenable. The WE  signal falls some time later. Therefore, the\nmemory cycle begins as a read. The data bus will be driven if O E\nis LOW; however, it will be HI-Z when WE  is asserted LOW. The\nchip enable and WE  controlled write timing cases are shown in\nthe Figure 7 on page 11 . In the Figure 8 on page 11 , the data bus\nis shown as a HI-Z condition while the chip is write-enabled an d\nbefore the required setup time. Although this is drawn to look like\na mid-level voltage, it is recommended that all DQ pins comply\nwith the minimum VIH/VIL operating levels.\nWrite access to the array begins on the falling edge of WE  after\nthe memory cycle is ini tiated. The wr ite access terminates on t he\ndeassertion of WE  or CE1 or CE2, whichever comes first. A valid\nwrite operation requires the user to meet the access time\nspecification bef ore deasserting WE  or chip enable. The data\nsetup time indicates the interval during which data cannot\nchange before the end of the write access. \nUnlike other nonvolatile memory te chnologies, there is no write\ndelay with F-RAM. Because the read and write access times ofthe underlying memory are the same, the user experiences no\ndelay through the bus. The entire memory operation occurs in a\nsingle bus cycle. Data polling, a  technique used with EEPROMs\nto determine if a write is complete, is unnecessary.\nPage Mode Operation\nThe FM28V100 provides the user fast access to any data withina row element. Each row has eight column-address locations\n(bytes). Address inputs A\n2–A0 define the column address to be\naccessed. An access can start anywhere within a row and othercolumn locations may be accessed without the need to toggle\nthe chip enable \npins. For fast access reads, after the first data\nbyte is driven to the bus, the column address inputs A2–A0 may\nbe changed to a new value. A new data byte is then driven to th e\nDQ pins. For fast access writes, the first write pulse defines the\nfirst write access. While the device is selected (both chip ena bles\nasserted), a subsequent write pulse along with a new column\naddress provides a page mode write access.\nPre-charge Operation\nThe pre-charge operation is an internal condition in which the\nmemory state is prepared for a new access. Pre-charge is\nuser-initiated by driving at least one of the chip enable signa ls to\nan inactive state. The chip enable must remain inactive at leas t\nthe minimum pre-charge time, tPC. \nPre-charge is also activated by changing the upper addresses,\nA16–A3. The current row is first closed before accessing the new\nrow. The device automatically detects an upper order addresschange, which starts a pre-charge operation. The new address\nis latched and the new read data is valid within the t\nAA address\naccess time; see Figure 4 on page 10 . A similar sequence occurs\nfor write cycles; see Figure 9 on page 11 . The rate at which\nFM28V100\nDocument Number: 001-86202 Rev. *G Page 5 of 18random addresses ca n be issued is tRC and tWC, respectively.\nSRAM Drop-In Replacement\nThe FM28V100 is designed to be a drop-in replacement for\nstandard asynchronous SRAMs. The device does not require\nchip enable pins to toggle for each new address. Both chip\nenable pins may remain active indefinitely while VDD is applied.\nWhen both chip enable pins are active, the device automaticallydetects address changes and a new access begins. It also allows\npage mode operation at s peeds up to  33 MHz. \nA typical application is shown in Figure 2 . It shows a pull-up\nresistor on CE\n1, which will keep the pin HIGH during power\ncycles, assuming the M CU / MPU pin tristat es during the reset\ncondition.The pull-up resistor v alue should be chosen to ensure\nthe CE1 pin tracks VDD to a high enough value, so that the\ncurrent drawn when CE1 is LOW is not an issue. Although not\nrequired, it is recommended that CE2 be tied to VDD i f  t h e\ncontroller provides an active-low chip enable. A 10-k \uf057 resistor\ndraws 330 µA when CE1 is LOW and VDD = 3.3 V.Note that if CE1 is tied to ground and CE2 tied to VDD, the user\nmust be sure WE  is not LOW at power-up or power-down events.\nIf the chip is enabled and WE  is LOW during power cycles, data\nwill be corrupted. Figure 3  shows a pull-up resistor on WE , which\nwill keep the pin HIGH durin g power cycles, assuming the\nMCU/MPU pin tristates during the reset condition.The pull-up\nresistor value should be chosen to ensure the WE  pin tracks VDD\nto a high enough value, so that the current drawn when WE  is\nLOW is not an issue. A 10-k \uf057 resistor draws 330 µA when WE\nis LOW and VDD = 3.3 V. \nFor applications that require t he lowest power consumption, the\nchip enable signal should be active only during memoryaccesses. Due to the external pull-up resistor, some supply\ncurrent will be drawn while CE\n1 is LOW. When CE1 is HIGH, the\ndevice draws no more than the maximum standby current ISB. Figure 2.
