It has been designed to \noperate efficiently with a USB host controller by using as little as possible of the total USB bandwidth \navailable.  \n \n4.1 Key Features  \nFunctional Integration. Fully integrated EEPROM, USB termination resistors , clock generation, AVCC \nfiltering, POR  and LDO regulator.  \nConfigurable CBUS I/O Pin Options. The fully integrated EEPROM allows configuration of the Control \nBus (CBUS) functionality, signal inversion and drive strength selection.  There are 5 configurable CB US \nI/O pins. These configurable options are  \n1. TXDEN  - transmit enable for RS485 designs.  \n2. PWREN# - Power control for high power, bus powered designs.  \n3. TXLED# - for pulsing an LED upon transmission of data.  \n4. RXLED# - for pulsing an LED upon receiving data.  \n5. TX&RXLED# - which will pulse an LED upon transmission OR reception of data . \n6. SLEEP# - indicates that the device going into USB suspend mode.  \n7. CLK48 / CLK24 / CLK12 / CLK6 - 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz, and 6MHz clock output signal \noptions.  \nThe CBUS pins can also be individually configured as GPIO pins, similar to asynchronous bit bang mode. \nIt is possible to use this mode while the UART interface is being used, thus providing up to 4 general \npurpose I/O pins which are available during normal  operation. An application note, AN232R -01, available \nfrom FTDI website  (www.ftdichip.com ) describes this feature.  \nThe CBUS lines can be configured with any one of these output options by setting bits in the internal \nEEPROM. The device is supplied with the most commonly used pin definitions pre -programmed - see \nSection 8 for details.  \nAsynchronous Bit Bang Mode with RD# and WR# Strobes. The FT232R supports FTDI‟s previous \nchip generation bit -bang mode. In bit -bang mode, the eight UART lines can be switched  from the regular \ninterface mode to an 8 -bit general purpose I/O port. Data packets can be sent to the device and they will \nbe sequentially sent to the interface at a rate controlled by an internal timer (equivalent to the baud rate \npre-scaler). With the F T232R device this mode has been enhanced by outputting the internal RD# and \nWR# strobes signals which can be used to allow external logic to be clocked by accesses to the bit -bang \nI/O bus. This option will be described more fully in a separate application note available from FTDI \nwebsite  (www.ftdichip.com ). \nSynchronous Bit Bang Mode. The FT232R supports synchronous bit bang mode. This mode differs from \nasynchronous bit bang mode in that the interface pins are only read when the device is written to. This \nmakes it easier for the controlling program to measure the response to an output stimulus as the data \nreturned is synchronous to the output data. An application note, AN232R -01, available from FTDI website  \n(www.ftdichip.com ) describes this feature.  \nFTDIChip -ID™. The FT232R also includes the new FTDIChip -ID™ security dongle feature. This \nFTDIChip -ID™ feature allows a unique number to be burnt into each device during manufacture. This \nnumber cannot be reprogrammed. This number is only readable over USB and forms a b asis of a security \ndongle which can be used to protect any customer application software being copied. This allows the \npossibility of using the FT232R in a dongle for software licensing. Further to this, a renewable license \nscheme can be implemented based on the FTDIChip -ID™ number when encrypted with other information. \nThis encrypted number can be stored in the user area of the FT232R internal EEPROM, and can be \ndecrypted, then compared with the protected FTDIChip -ID™ to verify that a license is valid. Web  based \napplications can be used to maintain product licensing this way. An application note, AN232R -02, \navailable from FTDI website  (www.ftdichip.com ) describes this feature.  \nThe FT232R is capable of operating at a voltage supply between +3.3V and +5V with a nominal \noperational mode current of 15mA and a nominal USB suspend mode current of 70µA. This al lows greater \nmargin for peripheral designs to meet the USB suspend mode current limit of 2.5mA . An integrated level \nconverter within the UART interface allows the FT232R to interface to UART logic running at +1.8V, 2.5V, \n+3.3V or +5V.  \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  15 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n4.2 Functional Block Desc riptions  \nThe following paragraphs detail each function within the FT232R. Please refer to the block diagram shown \nin Figure 2.1  \nInternal EEPROM. The internal EEPROM in the FT232R is used to store USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID \n(PID), device serial number,  product description string and various other USB configuration descriptors. \nThe internal EEPROM is also used to configure the CBUS pin functions. The FT232R is supplied with the \ninternal EEPROM pre -programmed as described in Section  8.  A user area of the internal EEPROM is \navailable to system designers to allow storing additional data. The internal EEPROM descriptors can be \nprogrammed in circuit, over USB without any additional voltage requirement. It can be programmed \nusing the FTDI utility software called MPROG, which can be downloaded from FTDI Utilities  on the FTDI \nwebsite  (www.ftdichip.com ). \n+3.3V LDO Regulator. The +3.3V LDO regulator generates the +3.3V reference voltage for driving the \nUSB transceiver cell output buffers. It requires an external decoupling capacitor to be att ached to the  \n3V3OUT regulator output pin. It also provides +3.3V power to the 1.5kΩ internal pull up resistor on \nUSBDP. The main function of the LDO is to power the USB Transceiver and the Reset Generator Cells \nrather than to power external logic. However,  it can be used to supply external circuitry requiring a \n+3.3V nominal supply with a maximum current of 50mA.  \nUSB Transceiver. The USB Transceiver Cell provides the USB 1.1 / USB 2.0 full -speed physical interface \nto the USB cable. The output drivers provid e +3.3V level slew rate control signalling, whilst a differential \ninput receiver and two single ended input receivers provide USB data in, Single -Ended -0 (SE0) and USB \nreset detection conditions respectfully. This function also incorporates the internal US B series termination \nresistors  on the USB data lines and a 1.5kΩ pull up resistor on USBDP.  \nUSB DPLL. The USB DPLL cell locks on to the incoming NRZI USB data and generates recovered clock \nand data signals for the Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block.  \nInter nal 12MHz Oscillator - The Internal 12MHz Oscillator cell generates a 12MHz reference clock. This \nprovides an input to the x4 Clock Multiplier function. The 12MHz Oscillator is also used as the reference \nclock for the SIE, USB Protocol Engine and UART FIFO  controller blocks.  \nClock Multiplier / Divider. The Clock Multiplier / Divider takes the 12MHz input from the Internal \nOscillator function and generates the 48MHz, 24MHz, 12MHz and 6MHz reference clock signals. The 48Mz \nclock reference is used by the USB D PLL and the Baud Rate Generator blocks.  \nSerial Interface Engine (SIE). The Serial Interface Engine (SIE) block performs the parallel to serial \nand serial to parallel conversion of the USB data. In accordance with the USB 2.0 specification, it \nperforms bit stuffing/un -stuffing and CRC5/CRC16 generation. It also checks the CRC on the USB data \nstream.  \nUSB Protocol Engine. The USB Protocol Engine manages the data stream from the device USB control \nendpoint. It handles the low level USB protocol requests generat ed by the USB host controller and the \ncommands for controlling the functional parameters of the UART in accordance with the USB 2.0 \nspecification chapter 9.  \nFIFO R X Buffer (128 bytes). Data sent from the USB host controller to the UART via the USB data OUT  \nendpoint is stored in the FIFO RX (receive) buffer. Data is removed from the buffer to the UART transmit \nregister under control of the UART FIFO controller.  (Rx relative to the USB interface).  \nFIFO TX Buffer (256 bytes). Data from the UART receive registe r is stored in the T X buffer . The USB \nhost controller removes data from the FIFO TX Buffer by sending a USB request for data from the device \ndata IN endpoint.  (Tx relative to the USB interface).  \nUART FIFO Controller. The UART FIFO controller handles the transfer of data between the FIFO RX and \nTX buffers and the UART transmit and receive registers.  \nUART Controller with Programmable Signal Inversion and High Drive. Together with the UART \nFIFO Controller the UART Controller handles the transfer of data betw een the FIFO RX and FIFO TX \nbuffers and the UART transmit and receive registers. It performs asynchronous 7 or 8 bit parallel to serial \nand serial to parallel conversion of the data on the RS232 (or RS422 or RS485) interface.  \nControl signals supported by UART mode include RTS, CTS, DSR, DTR, DCD and RI. The UART Controller \nalso provides a transmitter enable control signal pin option ( TXDEN ) to assist with interfacing to RS485 \ntransceivers. RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR and X ON / XOFF handshaking options are also suppor ted. Handshaking \nis handled in hardware to ensure fast response times. The UART interface also supports the RS232 \nBREAK setting and detection conditions.  \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  16 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \nAdditionally, the UART signals can each be individually inverted and have a configurable high drive \nstrength capability. Both these features are configurable in the EEPROM.  \nBaud Rate Generator - The Baud Rate Generator provides a 16x clock input to the UART Controller \nfrom the 48MHz reference clock. It consists of a 14 bit pre -scaler and 3 register bits which provide fine \ntuning of the baud rate (used to divide by a number plus a fraction or “sub -integer”). This determines the \nbaud rate of the UART, which is programmable from 183 baud to 3 Mbaud.  \nThe FT232R supports all standard baud rates and non -standar d baud rates from 183 Baud up to 3 \nMbaud. Achievable non -standard baud rates are calculated as follows - \nBaud Rate = 3000000 / (n + x) \nwhere „n‟ can be any integer between 2 and 16,384 ( = 214 ) and „ x’ can be a sub -integer of the value 0, \n0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.5, 0.625, 0.75, or 0.875. When n = 1, x = 0, i.e. baud rate divisors with values \nbetween 1 and 2 are not possible.  \nThis gives achievable baud rates in the range 183.1 baud to 3,000,000 baud. When a  non-standard baud \nrate is required simply pass the required baud rate value to the driver as normal, and the FTDI driver will \ncalculate the required divisor, and set the baud rate. See FTDI application note AN232B -05 on the FTDI \nwebsite  (www.ftdichip.com ) for more details.  \nRESET Generator - The integrated Reset Generator Cell provides a reliable power -on reset to the device \ninternal circuitry at power up. The RESET# input pin allows an external device to reset the FT232R.  \nRESET# can be tied to VCC or left unconnected if not being used.  \n \n \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  17 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n5 Devices Characteristics and Ratings  \n5.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings  \nThe absolute maximum ratings for the FT232R devices are as follows.

The illustrations have \nomitted pin numbers for ease of understanding since the pins differ between the FT232RL and FT232RQ \npackage options.  \nAll USB power configurations illustrated apply to both package options for the FT232R device. Please r efer \nto Section 3 for the package option pin -out and signal descriptions.  \n \n6.1 USB Bus Powered  Configuration  \n \nFigure 6.1 Bus Powered Configuration  \nFigure 6.1 Illustrates the FT232R in a typical USB bus powered design configuration. A USB bus powered \ndevice gets its power from the US B bus. Basic rules for USB bus power devices are as follows – \ni) On plug -in to USB, the device should draw no more current than 100mA.  \nii) In USB Suspend mode the device should draw no more than 2.5mA . \niii) A bus powered high power USB device (one that draws more than 100mA) should use one of \nthe CBUS pins configured as PWREN# and use it to keep the current below 100mA on plug -in \nand 2.5mA  on USB suspend.  \niv) A device that consumes more than 100mA cannot be plugg ed into a USB bus powered hub.  \nv) No device can draw more than 500mA from the USB bus.  \nThe power descriptors in the internal EEPROM of the FT232R should be programmed to match the current \ndrawn by the device.  \nA ferrite bead is connected in series with the USB  power supply to reduce EMI noise from the FT232R and \nassociated circuitry being radiated down the USB cable to the USB host.

A USB self powered device \ngets its power from its own power supply, VCC, and does not draw current from the USB bus. The ba sic \nrules for USB self powered devices are as follows – \ni) A self powered device should not force current down the USB bus when the USB host or hub \ncontroller is powered down.  \nii) A self powered device can use as much current as it needs during normal operation a nd USB \nsuspend as it has its own power supply.  \niii) A self powered device can be used with any USB host, a bus powered USB hub or a self \npowered USB hub.  \nThe power descriptor in the internal EEPROM of the FT232R should be programmed to a value of zero \n(self pow ered).  \nIn order to comply with the first requirement above, the USB bus power (pin 1) is used to control the \nRESET# pin of the FT232R device. When the USB host or hub is powered up an internal 1.5kΩ resistor on \nUSBDP is pulled up to +3.3V (generated using the 4K7 and 10k resistor network), thus identifying the \ndevice as a full speed device to the USB host or hub. When the USB host or hub is powered off, RESET# \nwill be low and the FT232R is held in reset. Since RESET# is low, the internal 1.5kΩ resistor is n ot pulled \nup to any power supply (hub or host is powered down), so no current flows down USBDP via the 1.5kΩ \npull-up resistor. Failure to do this may cause some USB host or hub controllers to power up erratically.  \nFigure 6.2 illustrates a self powered design which has a + 4V to +5 .25V supply.  \nNote:  \n1. When the FT232R is in reset, the UART interface I/O pins are tri -stated. Input pins have internal \n200kΩ pull-up resistors to VCCIO, so they will gently pull high unless driven by some external \nlogic.  \n2. When using internal FT232R oscillator the VCC supply voltage range must be +4.0V to 5.25V.  \n3. When using external oscillator the VCC supply voltage range must be +3.3V to 5.25V  \nAny design which interfaces to +3.3 V or +1.8V would be having a +3.3V or +1.8V supply to \nVCCIO.  \n \n \n\n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  25 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n6.3 USB Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration  \nFT232R\nGNDGND100nF VCC\n USBDM\n USBDP\n VCCIO\nNC\n RESET#\n NC\n OSCI\n OSCO\n 3V3OUT\nA\nG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDT\nE\nS\nTTXD  \nRXD  \nRTS# \nCTS# \nDTR# \nDSR# \nDCD# \nRI# \nCBUS0 \nCBUS1 \nCBUS2 \nCBUS3 \nCBUS4 1\n2\n3\n4\nGNDSHIELD\nGND100nF 4.7uF+510nF+Ferrite Beads d\ngP-Channel Power\nMOSFET\nPWREN#1KSwitched 5V Power\nTo External Logic\nSoft Start\nCircuit0.1uF 0.1uF\n5V VCC5V VCC\n5V VCC\n10K\n \nFigure 6.3 Bus Powered with Power Switching Configuration  \nA requirement of USB bus powered applications, is when in USB suspend mode, the application draws a \ntotal current of less than 2.5mA . This requirement includes external logic. Some external logic has the \nability  to power itself down into a low current state by monitoring the PWREN# signal. For external logic \nthat cannot power itself down in this way, the FT232R provides a simple but effective method of turning \noff power during the USB suspend mode.  \nFigure 6.3 shows an example of using a discrete P -Channel MOSFET to control the power to external \nlogic. A suitable device to do this is an International Rectifier (www.irf.com) IR LML6402, or equivalent. It \nis recommended that a “soft start” circuit consisting of a 1kΩ series resistor and a 0.1μF capacitor is used \nto limit the current surge when the MOSFET turns on. Without the soft start circuit it is possible that the \ntransient po wer surge, caused when the MOSFET switches on, will reset the FT232R or the USB host/hub \ncontroller. The soft start circuit example shown in Figure 6.3 powers up with a slew rate of \napproximaely12.5V/ms. Thus supply voltage to external logic transitions from GND to +5V in \napproximately 400 microseconds.  \nAs an alternative to the MOSFET, a dedicated power switch IC with inbuilt “soft -start” can be used. A \nsuitable power s witch IC for such an application is the Micrel ( www.micrel.com ) MIC2025 -2BM or \nequivalent.  \nWith power switching controlled designs the following should be noted:  \ni) The external logic to which the power is being switched should have its own reset circuitry to \nautomatically reset the logic when power is re -applied when moving out of suspend mode.  \nii) Set the Pull -down on Suspend opti on in the internal FT232R EEPROM.  \niii) One of the CBUS Pins should be configured as PWREN# in the internal FT232R EEPROM, and used \nto switch the power supply to the external circuitry. This should be pulled high through a 10 kΩ \nresistor.  \niv) For USB high -power bus powered applications (one that consumes greater than 100mA, and up \nto 500mA of current from the USB bus), the power consumption of the application must be set in \nthe Max Power field in the internal FT232R EEPROM. A high -power bus powered application uses \nthe descriptor in the internal FT232R EEPROM to inform the system of its power requirements.  \nv) PWREN# gets its VCC from VCCIO. For designs using 3V3 logic, ensure VCCIO is not powered \ndown using the external logic. In this case use the +3V3OUT.  \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  26 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n6.4 USB Bus Power ed with Selectable External Logic Supply  \nFT232R\nA\nG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDT\nE\nS\nT100nF3V3OUTVCCIO\nNCRESET#NC10nFTXD\nRXD\nRTS#\nCTS#\nDTR#\nDSR#\nDCD#\nRI#\nCBUS0\nCBUS3CBUS2CBUS1USBDPUSBDMVCC1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nOSCI\nOSCO\nCBUS4Ferrite\nBead\n+\nSHIELD\nGND\nGND\nGND3.3V or 5V \nSupply to \nExternal Logic\n100nF\n+100nFVcc\n4.7uF\nGND1\nJumper\nSLEEP#PWREN#2\n3Vcc\nVCCIO\n10KVCCIO\n \nFigure 6.4 USB Bus Powered with +3.3V or + 5V External Logic Power Supply  \nFigure 6.4 illustrates a USB bus power application with selectable external logic supply. The external logic \ncan be selected between +3.3V and +5V using the jumper switch. This jumper is used to allow the \nFT232R to be interfaced wit h a +3.3V or +5V logic devices. The VCCIO pin is either supplied with +5V \nfrom the USB bus (jumper pins1 and 2 connected), or from the +3.3V output from the FT232R 3V3OUT \npin (jumper pins 2 and 3 connected). The supply to VCCIO is also used to supply exter nal logic.  \nWith bus powered applications, the following should be noted:  \ni) To comply with the 2.5mA  current supply limit during USB suspend mode, PWREN# or \nSLEEP# signals should be used to power down external logic in this mode. If this is not \npossible, use the configuration shown in Section 6.3. \nii) The maximum current sourced from the USB bus during normal operation should not exceed \n100mA, otherwise a bus powered design with power switching (Section  6.3) should be used.  \nAnother possible configuration could use a discrete low dropout (LDO) regulator which is supplied by the \n5V on the USB bus to supply between +1.8V and +2.8V to the VCCIO pin and to the external logic. In \nthis case VCC would be supplied with the +5V from the USB bus and the VCCIO would be supplied from \nthe output of the LDO regulator. This results in the FT232R I/O pins driving out at between +1.8V and \n+2.8V logic levels.  \nFor a USB bus powered application, it is important to consider the following when selecting the regulator:  \ni) The regulator must be capable of sustaining its output voltage with an input voltage of \n+4.35V. An Low Drop Out (LDO) regulator should be selected.  \nii) The qu iescent current of the regulator must be low enough to meet the total current \nrequirement of <= 2.5mA  during USB suspend mode.  \nA suitable series of LDO regulators that meets these requirements is the MicroChip/Telcom \n(www.microchip.com) TC55 series of devi ces. These devices can supply up to 250mA current and have a \nquiescent current of under 1μA.  \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  27 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n7 Application Examples  \nThe following sections illustrate possible applications of the FT232R.

In this \napplication, a TTL to RS232 Level Converter IC is used on the serial UART interface of the FT232R to \nconvert the TTL levels of the FT232R to RS232 levels. This level shift can be done  using the popular “213” \nseries of TTL to RS232 level converters. These “213” devices typically have 4 transmitters and 5 receivers \nin a 28 -LD SSOP package and feature an in -built voltage converter to convert the +5V (nominal) VCC to \nthe + /- 9 volts requir ed by RS232. A  useful feature of these devices is the SHDN# pin which can be used \nto power down the device to a low quiescent current during USB suspend mode.  \nA suitable level shifting device is the Sipex SP213EHCA which is capable of RS232 communication a t up \nto 500k baud. If a lower baud rate is acceptable, then several pin compatible alternatives are available \nsuch as the Sipex SP213ECA, the Maxim MAX213CAI and the Analogue Devices ADM213E, which are all \nsuitable for communication at up to 115.2k baud. I f a higher baud rate is required, the Maxim \nMAX3245CAI device is capable of RS232 communication rates up to 1Mbaud. Note that the MAX3245 is \nnot pin compatible with the 213 series devices and that the SHDN pin on the MAX device is active high \nand should be  connect to PWREN# pin instead of SLEEP# pin.  \nIn example shown, the CBUS0 and CBUS1 have been configured as TXLED# and RXLED# and are being \nused to drive two LEDs.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  28 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n7.2 USB to RS485 Coverter  \nFT232R\nGNDGND100nF VCC\n USBDM\n USBDP\n VCCIO\nNC\n RESET#\n NC\n OSCI\n OSCO\n 3V3OUT\nA\nG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDT\nE\nS\nTTXD  \nRXD  \nRTS# \nCTS# \nDTR# \nDSR# \nDCD# \nRI# \nCBUS0 \nCBUS1 \nCBUS2 \nCBUS3 \nCBUS4 1\n2\n3\n4\nGNDSHIELD\nGND100nF 4.7uF+510nF+Ferrite Bead\n Vcc Vcc\nTXD  \nRXD  GNDDB9M\nSHIELD 10\nTXDEN\nGPOPWREN#GPIO0\nGPIO1 VCCIO\n10KRS485 LEVEL\nCONVERTERVcc\nSP481\n5123\n4\nLink120R7\n6\n \nFigure 7.2 Application Example Showing USB to RS485 Converter  \nAn example of using the FT232R as a USB to RS485 converter is shown in Figure 7.2. In this application, \na TTL to RS485 level converter IC is used on the serial UART interfac e of the FT232R to convert the TTL \nlevels of the FT232R to RS485 levels.  \nThis example uses the Sipex SP481 device.  Equivalent devices are available from Maxim and Analogue \nDevices. The SP481 is a RS485 device in a compact 8 pin SOP package. It has separate  enables on both \nthe transmitter and receiver. With RS485, the transmitter is only enabled when a character is being \ntransmitted from the UART. The TXDEN  signal CBUS pin option on the FT232R is provided for exactly this \npurpose and so the transmitter enabl e is wired to CBUS2 which has been configured as TXDEN . Similarly, \nCBUS3 has been configured as PWREN#. This signal is used to control the SP481‟s receiver enable. The \nreceiver enable is active low, so it is wired to the PWREN# pin to disable the receiver when in USB \nsuspend mode. CBUS2 = TXDEN  and CBUS3 = PWREN# are the default device configurations of the \nFT232R pins.  \nRS485 is a multi -drop network; so many devices can communicate with each other over a two wire cable \ninterface. The RS485 cable requires t o be terminated at each end of the cable. A link (which provides the \n120Ω termination) allows the cable to be terminated if the SP481 is physically positioned at either end of \nthe cable.  \nIn this example the data transmitted by the FT232R is also present on  the receive path of the SP481.This \nis a common feature of RS485 and requires the application software to remove the transmitted data from \nthe received data stream. With the FT232R it is possible to do this entirely in hardware by modifying the \nexample sho wn in Figure 7.2 by logically OR‟ing the FT232R TXDEN  and the SP481 receiver output and \nconnecting the output of the OR gate to the RXD of the FT232R.  \nNote that the TXDEN  is activated 1 bit period before the start bit. TXDEN  is deactivated at the same time \nas the stop bit. This is not configurable.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Copyright © 2010  Future Technology Devices International Limited  29 \nDocument No.: FT_000053  \nFT232R  USB UART IC  Datasheet  Version 2.10  \nClearance No.: FTDI# 38  \n7.3 USB to RS422 Converter  \nFT232R\nGNDGND100nF VCC\n USBDM\n USBDP\n VCCIO\nNC\n RESET#\n NC\n OSCI\n OSCO\n 3V3OUT\nA\nG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDG\nN\nDT\nE\nS\nTTXD  \nRXD  \nRTS# \nCTS# \nDTR# \nDSR# \nDCD# \nRI# \nCBUS0 \nCBUS1 \nCBUS2 \nCBUS3 \nCBUS4- 1\n2\n3\n4\nGNDSHIELD\nGND100nF 4.7uF+510nF+Ferrite Bead\n Vcc Vcc\nPWREN#RS422 LEVEL\nCONVERTERVcc\nSP4915\n34\n7 6TXDM\nTXDP\nRXDP\nRXDM120R10\n9\n11\n12\nSLEEP#RS422 LEVEL\nCONVERTER\nSP49134\n7 6Vcc\nVcc\n10K25\n120R11\n12910\nRTSM\nRTSP\nCTSP\nCTSMGNDDB9M\nSHIELDTXDM\nTXDP\nRXDP\nRXDM\nRTSM\nRTSP\nCTSP\nCTSM2\n \nFigure 7.3 USB to RS422 Converter Configuration  \nAn example of using the FT232R as a USB to RS422 converter is shown in Figure 7.3. In this application, \ntwo TTL to RS422 Level Converter ICs are used on the serial UART interface of the FT232R to convert the \nTTL levels of the FT232R to RS422 levels. There are many suitable level converter devices available. This \nexample uses Sipex SP491 devices which have enables on both the transmitter and receiver. Since the \nSP491 transmitter enable is active high, it is connected to a  CBUS pin in SLEEP# configuration. The \nSP491 receiver enable is active low and is therefore connected to a CBUS pin PWREN# configuration. This \nensures that when both the SP491 transmitters and receivers are enabled then the device is active, and \nwhen the d evice is in USB suspend mode, the SP491 transmitters and receivers are disabled. If a similar \napplication is used, but the design is USB BUS powered, it may be necessary to use a P -Channel logic \nlevel MOSFET (controlled by PWREN#) in the VCC line of the SP 491 devices to ensure that the USB \nstandby current of 2.5mA  is met.  \nThe SP491 is specified to transmit and receive data at a rate of up to 5 Mbaud.

This supply is available \nfrom the USB VBUS supply = +5 .0V. \n2. The EEPROM must  then be programmed to enable external oscillator.
