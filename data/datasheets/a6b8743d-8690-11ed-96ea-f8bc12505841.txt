The amplifier provides 15.5 dB of gain, \n+22 dBm of saturated power, and 23% PAE from a \n+5V supply voltage. An optional gate bias is provided \nto allow adjustment of gain, RF output power, and DC \npower dissipation.

If 0.254mm (10 mil) thick alumina thin film substrates must be \nused, the die should be raised 0.150mm (6 mils) so that the surface of \nthe die is coplanar with the surface of the substrate. One way to accom -\nplish this is to attach the 0.102mm (4 mil) thick die to a 0.150mm (6 mil) \nthick molybdenum heat spreader (moly-tab) which is then attached to the \nground plane (Figure 2).\nMicrostrip substrates should be located as close to the die as possible \nin order to minimize bond wire length. Typical die-to-substrate spacing is \n0.076mm to 0.152 mm (3 to 6 mils).\nHandling Precautions\nFollow these precautions to avoid permanent damage.\nStorage: All bare die are placed in either Waffle or Gel based ESD pro -\ntective containers, and then sealed in an ESD protective bag for shipment. \nOnce the sealed ESD protective bag has been opened, all die should be \nstored in a dry nitrogen environment.\nCleanliness: Handle the chips in a clean environment. DO NOT attempt \nto clean the chip using liquid cleaning systems.\nStatic Sensitivity: Follow ESD precautions to protect against > ± 250V \nESD strikes.\nTransients: Suppress instrument and bias supply transients while bias is \napplied. Use shielded signal and bias cables to minimize inductive pick-up.\nGeneral Handling: Handle the chip along the edges with a vacuum collet \nor with a sharp pair of bent tweezers. The surface of the chip may have fragile air bridges and should not be touched \nwith vacuum collet, tweezers, or fingers.\nMounting\nThe chip is back-metallized and can be die mounted with AuSn eutectic preforms or with electrically conductive epoxy. \nThe mounting surface should be clean and flat.\nEutectic Die Attach: A 80/20 gold tin preform is recommended with a work surface temperature of 255 °C and a tool \ntemperature of 265 °C. When hot 90/10 nitrogen/hydrogen gas is applied, tool tip temperature should be 290 °C. DO \nNOT expose the chip to a temperature greater than 320 °C for more than 20 seconds. No more than 3 seconds of \nscrubbing should be required for attachment.\nEpoxy Die Attach: Apply a minimum amount of epoxy to the mounting surface so that a thin epoxy fillet is observed \naround the perimeter of the chip once it is placed into position. Cure epoxy per the manufacturer’s schedule.\nWire Bonding\nBall or wedge bond with 0.025mm (1 mil) diameter pure gold wire. Thermosonic wirebonding with a nominal stage \ntemperature of 150 °C and a ball bonding force of 40 to 50 grams or wedge bonding force of 18 to 22 grams is rec -\nommended. Use the minimum level of ultrasonic energy to achieve reliable wirebonds. Wirebonds should be started \non the chip and terminated on the package or substrate.
