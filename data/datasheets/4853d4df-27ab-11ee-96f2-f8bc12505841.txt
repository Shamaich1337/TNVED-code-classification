It contains all of the functions required\nto implement a limited −feature, open loop, three or four\nphase motor control system. Constructed with Bipolar\nAnalog technology, it offers a high degree of performanceand ruggedness in hostile industrial environments. The\nMC33033 contains a rotor position decoder for proper\ncommutation sequencing, a temperature compensatedreference capable of supplying sensor power, a frequency\nprogrammable sawtooth oscillator, a fully accessible error\namplifier, a pulse width modulator comparator, three open\ncollector top drive outputs, and three high current totem pole\nbottom driver outputs ideally suited for driving powerMOSFETs.\nIncluded in the MC33033 are protective features\nconsisting of undervoltage lockout, cycle−by−cycle current\nlimiting with a latched shutdown mode, and internal thermal\nshutdown.\nTypical motor control functions include open loop speed\ncontrol, forward or reverse rotation, and run enable. In\naddition, the MC33033 has a 60 °/120\n°select pin which\nconfigures the rotor position decoder for either 60 ° or 120 °\nsensor electrical phasing inputs.\nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION\nA representative internal block diagram is shown in\nFigure 19, with various applications shown in Figures 35,\n37, 38, 42, 44, and 45. A discussion of the features and\nfunction of each of the internal blocks given below andreferenced to Figures 19 and 37.\nRotor Position Decoder\nAn internal rotor position decoder monitors the three\nsensor inputs (Pins 4, 5, 6) to provide the proper sequencing\nof the top and bottom drive outputs. The Sensor Inputs aredesigned to interface directly with open collector type Hall\nEffect switches or opto slotted couplers. Internal pull −up\nresistors are included to minimize the required number ofexternal components. The inputs are TTL compatible, with\ntheir thresholds typically at 2.2 V . The MC33033 series is\ndesigned to control three phase motors and operate with four\nof the most common conventions of sensor phasing. A\n60°/120\n°Select (Pin 18) is conveniently provided which\naffords the MC33033 to configure itself to control motors\nhaving either 60 °, 120 °, 240 ° or 300 ° electrical sensor\nphasing. With three Sensor Inputs there are eight possibleinput code combinations, six of which are valid rotor\npositions. The remaining two codes are invalid and are\nusually caused by an open or shorted sensor line. With six\nvalid input codes, the decoder can resolve the motor rotor\nposition to within a window of 60 electrical degrees.The Forward/Reverse input (Pin 3) is used to change the\ndirection of motor rotation by reversing the voltage acrossthe stator winding. When the input changes state, from high\nto low with a given sensor input code (for example 100), the\nenabled top and bottom drive outputs with the same alpha\ndesignation are exchanged (A\nT to A B, BT to B B, CT to C B).\nIn effect the commutation sequence is reversed and themotor changes directional rotation.\nMotor on/off control is accomplished by the Output\nEnable (Pin19). When left disconnected, an internal pull −up\nresistor to a positive source enables sequencing of the top\nand bottom drive outputs. When grounded, the Top Drive\nOutputs turn off and the bottom drives are forced low,\ncausing the motor to coast.\nThe commutation logic truth table is shown in Figure 20.\nIn half wave motor drive applications, the Top Drive\nOutputs are not required and are typically left disconnected.\nError Amplifier\nA high performance, fully compensated Error Amplifier\nwith access to both inputs and output (Pins 9, 10, 11) isprovided to facilitate the implementation of closed loop\nmotor speed control. The amplifier features a typical dc\nvoltage gain of 80 dB, 0.6 MHz gain bandwidth, and a wide\ninput common mode voltage range that extends from ground\nto V\nref. In most open loop speed control applications, the\namplifier is configured as a unity gain voltage follower with\nthe Noninverting Input connected to the speed set voltage\nsource. Additional configurations are shown in Figures 30through 34.\nOscillator\nThe frequency of the internal ramp oscillator is\nprogrammed by the values selected for timing components\nRT and C T. Capacitor C T is charged from the Reference\nOutput (Pin 7) through resistor R T and discharged by an\ninternal discharge transistor. The ramp peak and valley\nvoltages are typically 4.1 V and 1.5 V respectively. Toprovide a good compromise between audible noise and\noutput switching efficiency, an oscillator frequency in the\nrange of 20 to 30 kHz is recommended. Refer to Figure 2 for\ncomponent selection.\nPulse Width Modulator\nThe use of pulse width modulation provides an energy\nefficient method of controlling the motor speed by varying\nthe average voltage applied to each stator winding during thecommutation sequence. As C\nT discharges, the oscillator sets\nboth latches, allowing conduction of the Top and Bottom\nDrive Outputs. The PWM comparator resets the upper latch,\nterminating the Bottom Drive Output conduction when the\npositive−going ramp of C T becomes greater than the Error\nAmplifier output. The pulse width modulator timing\ndiagram is shown in Figure 21.

Three Phase, Six Step Commutation Truth Table (Note 1)\nCurrent Limit\nContinuous operation of a motor that is severely\nover−loaded results in overheating and eventual failure.\nThis destructive condition can best be prevented with the use\nof cycle−by−cycle current limiting. That is, each on −cycle\nis treated as a separate event. Cycle −by−cycle current\nlimiting is accomplished by monitoring the stator currentbuild−up each time an output switch conducts, and upon\nsensing an over current condition, immediately turning off\nthe switch and holding it off for the remaining duration ofoscillator ramp−up period. The stator current is converted to\na voltage by inserting a ground −referenced sense resistor R\nS\n(Figure 35) in series with the three bottom switch transistors\n(Q4, Q5, Q6). The voltage developed across the sense\nresistor is monitored by the current sense input (Pin 12), and\ncompared to the internal 100 mV reference. If the current\nsense threshold is exceeded, the comparator resets the lower\nlatch and terminates output switch conduction. The value for\nthe sense resistor is:\nRS/C00430.1\nIstator(max)\nThe dual−latch PWM configuration ensures that only one\nsingle output conduction pulse occurs during any given\noscillator cycle, whether terminated by the output of the\nError Amplifier or the current limit comparator.Reference\nThe on−chip 6.25 V regulator (Pin 7) provides charging\ncurrent for the oscillator timing capacitor, a reference for the\nError Amplifier, and can supply 20 mA of current suitable\nfor directly powering sensors in low voltage applications. In\nhigher voltage applications it may become necessary to\ntransfer the power dissipated by the regulator off the IC. This\nis easily accomplished with the addition of an external pass\ntransistor as shown in Figure 22. A 6.25 V reference level\nwas chosen to allow implementation of the simpler NPNcircuit, where V\nref − VBE exceeds the minimum voltage\nrequired by Hall Effect sensors over temperature. With\nproper transistor selection, and adequate heatsinking, up to\none amp of load current can be obtained.\nUndervoltage Lockout\nA dual Undervoltage Lockout has been incorporated to\nprevent damage to the IC and the external power switch\ntransistors. Under low power supply conditions, itguarantees that the IC and sensors are fully functional, and\nthat there is sufficient Bottom Drive Output voltage. The\npositive power supply to the IC (V\nCC) is monitored to a\nthreshold of 8.9 V . This level ensures sufficient gate drive\nnecessary to attain low R DS(on)  when interfacing with\nstandard power MOSFET devices. When directly powering\nthe Hall sensors from the reference, improper sensor\nMC33033, NCV33033\nhttp://onsemi.com\n13operation can result if the reference output voltage should\nfall below 4.5 V . If one or both of the comparators detects an\nundervoltage condition, the top drives are turned off and theBottom Drive Outputs are held in a low state. Each of the\ncomparators contain hysteresis to prevent oscillations when\ncrossing their respective thresholds.\nFigure 21.

Each output is capable of sourcing and sinking upto 100 mA.\nThermal Shutdown\nInternal thermal shutdown circuity is provided to protect\nthe IC in the event the maximum junction temperature is\nexceeded. When activated, typically at 170 °C, the IC acts as\nthough the regulator was disabled, in turn shutting down the\nIC.SYSTEM APPLICATIONS\nThree Phase Motor Commutation\nThe three phase application shown in Figure 35 is an open\nloop motor controller with full wave, six step drive. The\nupper power switch transistors are Darlington PNPs while\nthe lower switches are N −Channel power MOSFETs. Each\nof these devices contains an internal parasitic catch diodethat is used to return the stator inductive energy back to the\npower supply. The outputs are capable of driving a delta or\nwye connected stator, and a grounded neutral wye if splitsupplies are used. At any given rotor position, only one top\nand one bottom power switch (of different totem poles) is\nenabled. This configuration switches both ends of the stator\nwinding from supply to ground which causes the current\nflow to be bidirectional or full wave. A leading edge spikeis usually present on the current waveform and can cause a\ncurrent−limit error. The spike can be eliminated by adding\nMC33033, NCV33033\nhttp://onsemi.com\n16an RC filter in series with the Current Sense Input. Using a\nlow inductance type resistor for R S will also aid in spike\nreduction. Figure 36 shows the commutation waveforms\nover two electrical cycles. The first cycle (0 ° to 360 °) depicts\nmotor operation at full speed while the second cycle (360 °to 720 °) shows a reduced speed with about 50% pulse width\nmodulation.

For closed loop speed control, the MC33033\nrequires an input voltage proportional to the motor speed.\nTraditionally this has been accomplished by means of a\ntachometer to generate the motor speed feedback voltage.\nFigure 38 shows an application whereby an MC33039,\npowered from the 6.25 V reference (Pin 7) of the MC33033,\nis used to generate the required feedback voltage without the\nneed of a costly tachometer. The same Hall sensor signals\nused by the MC33033 for rotor position decoding areutilized by the MC33039. Every positive or negative going\ntransition of the Hall sensor signals on any of the sensor lines\ncauses the MC33039 to produce an output pulse of defined\namplitude and time duration, as determined by the external\nresistor R\n1 and capacitor C 1. The resulting output train ofpulses present at Pin 5 of the MC33039 are integrated by the\nError Amplifier of the MC33033 configured as anintegrator, to produce a dc voltage level which is\nproportional to the motor speed. This speed proportional\nvoltage establishes the PWM reference level at Pin 11 of the\nMC33033 motor controller and completes or closes the\nfeedback loop. The MC33033 outputs drive a TMOS power\nMOSFET 3 −phase bridge. High current can be expected\nduring conditions of start −up and when changing direction\nof the motor.\nThe system shown in Figure 38 is designed for a motor\nhaving 120/240 degrees Hall sensor electrical phasing. The\nsystem can easily be modified to accommodate 60/300\ndegree Hall sensor electrical phasing by removing the\njumper (J\n1) at Pin 18 of the MC33033.\nFigure 38.

With six\nstep drive, an input signal change must occur every 60\nelectrical degrees, however, the relative signal phasing is\ndependent upon the mechanical sensor placement. A\ncomparison of the conventions in electrical degrees is shown\nin Figure 39. From the sensor phasing table (Figure 40), note\nthat the order of input codes for 60 ° phasing is the reverse of\n300°. This means the MC33033, when the 60 °/120° select\n(Pin 18) and the FWD/REV (Pin 3) both in the high state(open), is configured to operate a 60 ° sensor phasing motor\nin the forward direction. Under the same conditions a 300 °\nsensor phasing motor would operate equally well but in the\nreverse direction. One would simply have to reverse the\nFWD/REV switch (FWD/REV closed) in order to cause the\n300°motor to also operate in the same direction. The same\ndifference exists between the 120 ° and 240 ° conventions.\nFigure 39.

Key to the operation is the input sensor\ncode [100] which produces a top −left (Q 1) and a bottom −right\n(Q3) drive when the controller’ s Forward/Reverse pin is at\nlogic [1]; top −right (Q 4), bottom−left (Q 2) drive is realized\nwhen the Forward/Reverse pin is at logic [0]. This code\nsupports the requirements necessary for H −bridge drive\naccomplishing both direc tion and speed control.\nThe controller functions in a normal manner with a pulse\nwidth modulated frequency of approximately 25 kHz.\nMotor speed is controlled by adjusting the voltage presented\nto the noninverting input of the Error Amplifier establishingthe PWM ′s slice or reference level. Cycle −by−cycle current\nlimiting of the motor current is accomplished by sensing the\nvoltage (100 mV threshold) across the R\nS resistor to ground\nof the H−bridge motor current. The over current sense circuit\nmakes it possible to reverse the direction of the motor, on thefly, using the normal Forward/Reverse switch, and not have\nto completely stop before reversing.\nLAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS\nDo not attempt to construct any of the motor control\ncircuits on wire −wrap or plug −in prototype boards.  High\nfrequency printed circuit layout techniques are imperative to\nprevent pulse jitter. This is usually caused by excessive noise\npick−up imposed on the current sense or error amp inputs.\nThe printed circuit layout should contain a ground planewith low current signal and high drive and output buffer\ngrounds returning on separate paths back to the power\nsupply input filter capacitor V\nM. Ceramic bypass capacitors\n(0.01 μF) connected close to the integrated circuit at V CC,\nVref and error amplifier noninverting input may be required\ndepending upon circuit layout. This provides a low\nimpedance path for filtering any high frequency noise. All\nhigh current loops should be kept as short as possible using\nheavy copper runs to minimize radiated EMI.\nFigure 45.
