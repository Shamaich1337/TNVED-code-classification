Sensitivity adjustment \n  The total loading of electrode size and capacitance of connecting line on PCB can affect the \nsensitivity. So the sensitivity adjustment must according to the practical application on PCB. The \nTTP223-BA6/TTP223N-BA6 offers some methods for adjusting the sensitivity outside. \n1-1 by the electrode size \nUnder other conditions are fixed. Using a larger elect rode size can increase sensitivity. Otherwise it \ncan decrease sensitivity. But the electrode size must use in the effective scope. \n1-2 by the panel thickness Under other conditions are fixed. Using a thinner panel can increase sensitivity. Otherwise it can \ndecrease sensitivity. But the panel thickness must be below the maximum value. \n1-3 by the value of Cs (please see the down figure) \nUnder other conditions are fixed. When do not use the Cs to VSS, the sensitivity is most sensitive. \nWhen adding the values of Cs will reduce sensitivity in the useful range (0 ≦Cs≦50pF). \n65\n431\n2Q\nTOG\nAHLB\nVSSIVDDELECTRODE\nCsVDD\n \n \n2.

The capacitance Cs can be used to adjust the sensitivity. The value of Cs use smaller, then \nthe sensitivity will be better. The sensitivit y adjustment must according to the practical \napplication on PCB. The range of Cs value is 0~50pF. \n     5. The C1 capacitor must be used between VDD and VSS; and should be routed with very short \ntracks to the device’s VDD and VS S pins (TTP223-BA6/TTP223N-BA6). \n     6. The value of capacitors can be used by the real application for Ci and Co capacitors. \n     7. The sensitivity adjustment capacitors (Cs)  must use smaller temperature coefficient and more \nstable capacitors. Such are X7R, NPO for exam ple. So for touch application, recommend to \nuse NPO capacitor, for reducing that the temperature varies to affect sensitivity. \n \n \nPreliminaryTTP223-BA6 \nTTP223N-BA6\nTonTouchTM               \n  \n \n0 9 ’ / 1 1 / 3 0                                    P a g e  7  o f  8                                   V e r  :  2 . 1  \n   Package Type: SOT-23-6L \n \nPackage Outline Dimension \n \n \nPreliminaryTTP223-BA6 \nTTP223N-BA6\nTonTouchTM               \n  \n \n0 9 ’ / 1 1 / 3 0                                    P a g e  8  o f  8                                   V e r  :  2 . 1  \n ORDER INFORMATION \na.
