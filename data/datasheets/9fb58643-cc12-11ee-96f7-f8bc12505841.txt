### Component Summary: BPF-B48+ Bandpass Filter

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; typically RF components do not have standard voltage ratings.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; RF power input is limited to 0.15W max.
- **Power Consumption:** 0.15W max RF power input.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to 85°C.
- **Storage Temperature:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** Surface Mount, Case Style HZ1198.
- **Special Features:**
  - High rejection.
  - Good VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio), typically 1.2:1 at passband.
  - Shielded case for reduced interference.
  - Aqueous washable.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Description:**
The BPF-B48+ is a bandpass filter designed for RF applications, specifically operating in the frequency range of 47 to 49 MHz. Its primary function is to allow signals within this frequency range to pass while attenuating signals outside of this range, thereby improving signal quality and reducing interference.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Military:** Used in communication systems where signal integrity is critical.
- **Laboratory:** Employed in testing and measurement setups to isolate specific frequency signals.
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Helps in reducing unwanted harmonic frequencies in transmitters and receivers.
- **Transmitters/Receivers:** Essential in RF communication systems to ensure that only the desired frequency signals are transmitted or received.

This component is particularly useful in applications where high performance and reliability are required, such as in military and laboratory environments. Its compact size and surface mount design make it suitable for modern electronic circuit designs.
