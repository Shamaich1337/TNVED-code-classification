Temperatures quoted in relation to wave\nsoldering refer to the pin, not the housing.\n■If the components are to be washed varnished it is necessary to check whether the washing\nvarnish agent that is used has a negative effect on the wire insulation, any plastics that are used,\nor on glued joints. In particular, it is possible for washing varnish agent residues to have a\nnegative effect in the long-term on wire insulation.Washing processes may damage the product due to the possible static or cyclic mechanical\nloads (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning). They may cause cracks to develop on the product and its parts,\nwhich might lead to reduced reliability or lifetime.  \n■The following points must be observed if the components are potted in customer applications: \n– Many potting materials shrink as they harden. They therefore exert a pressure on the plastic\nhousing or core. This pressure can have a deleterious effect on electrical properties, and inextreme cases can damage the core or plastic housing mechanically.\n– It is necessary to check whether the potting material used attacks or destroys the wire\ninsulation, plastics or glue.\n– The effect of the potting material can change the high-frequency behaviour of the components.\n■Ferrites are sensitive to direct impact. This can cause the core material to flake, or lead tobreakage of the core.\n■Even for customer-specific products, conclusive validation of the component in the circuit can\nonly be carried out by the customer.\nDisplay of ordering codes for EPCOS products\nThe ordering code for one and the same product can be represented differently in data sheets, \ndata books, other publications and the website of EPCOS, or in order-related documents such as\nshipping notes, order confirmations and product labels. The varying representations of the \nordering codes are due to different processes employed and do not affect the \nspecifications of the respective products .
