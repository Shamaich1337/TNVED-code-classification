The DTO circuit timer starts on a falling edge on TXD. \nThe DTO circuit disables the CAN bus driver if no rising edge is seen before the timeout period expires. This \nfrees the bus for communication between other nodes on the network. The CAN driver is re-activated when \na recessive signal is seen on the TXD terminal, thus clearing the TXD DTO condition. The receiver and RXD \nterminal still reflect activity on the CAN bus, and the bus terminals are biased to the recessive level during a TXD \ndominant timeout.\nNormal CAN \ncommunication\nCAN \nBus\nSignal TXD fault stuck dominant: example PCB \nfailure or bad softwareFault is repaired & transmission \ncapability restored\nTXD \n(driver)\n%XV\x03ZRXOG\x03EH\x03³VWXFN\x03GRPLQDQW´\x03EORFNLQJ\x03FRPPXQLFDWLRQ\x03IRU\x03WKH\x03\nwhole network but TXD DTO prevents this and frees the bus for \ncommunication after the time t TXD_DTO .\n tTXD_DTO \nCommunication from \nlocal nodeCommunication from \nrepaired node\nRXD \n(receiver)\nCommunication from \nother bus node(s)Communication from \nrepaired local nodeCommunication from \nother bus node(s) tTXD_DTO Driver disabled freeing bus for other nodes\nFigure 9-1. Example Timing Diagram for TXD DTO\nNote\nThe minimum dominant TXD time allowed by the TXD DTO circuit limits the minimum possible \ntransmitted data rate of the device. The CAN protocol allows a maximum of eleven successive \ndominant bits (on TXD) for the worst case, where five successive dominant bits are followed \nimmediately by an error frame. This, along with the t TXD_DTO  minimum, limits the minimum data rate. \nCalculate the minimum transmitted data rate by: Minimum Data Rate = 11 / t TXD_DTO .\n9.3.2 Thermal Shutdown (TSD)\nIf the junction temperature of the device exceeds the thermal shutdown threshold (T TSD), the device turns off \nthe CAN driver circuits thus blocking the TXD-to-bus transmission path. The CAN bus terminals are biased to \nthe recessive level during a thermal shutdown, and the receiver-to-RXD path remains operational. The shutdown \ncondition is cleared when the junction temperature drops at least the thermal shutdown hysteresis temperature \n(TTSD_HYS ) below the thermal shutdown temperature (T TSD) of the device.www.ti.comTCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\n9.3.3 Undervoltage Lockout\nThe supply terminals have undervoltage detection that places the device in protected mode.

The bus terminals \n(CANH, CANL) have extremely low leakage currents when the device is unpowered to avoid loading down the \nbus. This is critical if some nodes of the network are unpowered while the rest of the of network remains in \noperation. The logic terminals also have extremely low leakage currents when the device is unpowered to avoid \nloading down other circuits that may remain powered.\n9.3.5 Floating Terminals\nThese devices have internal pull ups on critical terminals to place the device into known states if the terminals \nfloat. The TXD terminal is pulled up to V CC or V IO to force a recessive input level if the terminal floats. The STB \nterminal is also pulled up to force the device into low power Standby mode  if the terminal floats.\n9.3.6 CAN Bus Short Circuit Current Limiting\nThe device has two protection features that limit the short circuit current when a CAN bus line is short-circuit \nfault condition: driver current limiting (both dominant and recessive states) and TXD dominant state time out \nto prevent permanent higher short circuit current of the dominant state during a system fault. During CAN \ncommunication the bus switches between dominant and recessive states, thus the short circuit current may be \nviewed either as the instantaneous current during each bus state or as an average current of the two states. For \nsystem current (power supply) and power considerations in the termination resistors and common-mode choke \nratings, use the average short circuit current. Determine the ratio of dominant and recessive bits by the data \nin the CAN frame plus the following factors of the protocol and PHY that force either recessive or dominant at \ncertain times:\n•Control fields with set bits\n•Bit stuffing\n•Interframe spaceTCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\n•TXD dominant time out (fault case limiting)\nThese ensure a minimum recessive amount of time on the bus even if the data field contains a high percentage \nof dominant bits. The short circuit current of the bus depends on the ratio of recessive to dominant bits and their \nrespective short circuit currents. The average short circuit current may be calculated with the following formula:\nIOS(AVG)  = %Transmit × [(%REC_Bits × I OS(SS)_REC ) + (%DOM_Bits × I OS(SS)_DOM )] + [%Receive × I OS(SS)_REC ](1)\nWhere:\n•IOS(AVG)  is the average short circuit current\n•%Transmit is the percentage the node is transmitting CAN messages\n•%Receive is the percentage the node is receiving CAN messages\n•%REC_Bits is the percentage of recessive bits in the transmitted CAN messages\n•%DOM_Bits is the percentage of dominant bits in the transmitted CAN messages\n•IOS(SS)_REC  is the recessive steady state short circuit current\n•IOS(SS)_DOM  is the dominant steady state short circuit current\nNote\nConsider the short circuit current and possible fault cases of the network when sizing the power \nratings of the termination resistance and other network components.\n9.3.7 Digital Inputs and Outputs\n9.3.7.1 Devices with V CC Only (Devices without the "V" Suffix):\nThe 5-V V CC only devices are supplied by a single 5-V rail. The digital inputs have TTL input thresholds and are \ntherefore 5 V and 3.3 V compatible. The RXD outputs on these devices are driven to the V CC rail for logic high \noutput. Additionally, the TXD and STB pins are internally pulled up to V CC. The internal bias of the mode pins \nmay only place the device into a known state if the terminals float, they may not be adequate for system-level \nbiasing during transients or noisy environments.\nNote\nTXD pull up strength and CAN bit timing require special consideration when these devices are used \nwith CAN controllers with an open-drain TXD output. An adequate external pull up resistor must be \nused to ensure that the CAN controller output of the microcontroller maintains adequate bit timing to \nthe TXD input.\n9.3.7.2 Devices with V IO I/O Level Shifting (Devices with "V" Suffix):\nThese devices use a 5 V V CC power supply for the CAN driver and high speed receiver blocks. These \ntransceivers have a second power supply for I/O level-shifting (V IO). This supply is used to set the CMOS \ninput thresholds of the TXD and pins and the RXD high level output voltage. Additionally, the internal pull ups on \nTXD and STB are pulled up to V IO.www.ti.comTCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\n9.4 Device Functional Modes\nThe device has two main operating modes: Normal mode and Standby  mode. Operating mode selection is made \nvia the STB input terminal.\nTable 9-3.

A dominant bus \nstate is when the bus is driven differentially, corresponding to a logic low on the TXD and RXD terminal. A \nrecessive bus state is when the bus is biased to V CC / 2 via the high-resistance internal input resistors R IN of the \nreceiver, corresponding to a logic high on the TXD and RXD terminals.\nFigure 9-2.

The CAN driver and receiver are fully \noperational and CAN communication is bi-directional. The driver translates a digital input on TXD to a differential \noutput on CANH and CANL. The receiver translates the differential signal from CANH and CANL to a digital \noutput on RXD.\n9.4.3 Standby Mode\nActivate low power Standby mode by setting STB terminal high. In this mode the bus transmitter will not send \ndata nor will the normal mode receiver accept data as the bus lines are biased to ground minimizing the system \nsupply current. Only the low power receiver will be actively monitoring the bus for activity. RXD indicates a valid \nwake up event after a wake-up pattern (WUP) has been detected on the Bus. The low power receiver is powered \nusing only the V IO pin. This allows V CC to be removed reducing power consumption further.www.ti.comTCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\n9.4.3.1 Remote Wake Request via Wake Up Pattern (WUP) in Standby Mode\nThe TCAN1042  family offers a remote wake request feature that is used to indicate to the host microcontroller \nthat the bus is active and the node should return to normal operation.\nThese devices use the multiple filtered dominant wake up pattern (WUP) from the ISO11898-2 (2016) to qualify \nbus activity. Once a valid WUP has been received the wake request will be indicated to the microcontroller by a \nfalling edge and low corresponding to a "filtered" dominant on the RXD output terminal.\nThe WUP consists of a filtered dominant pulse, followed by a filtered recessive pulse, and finally by a second \nfiltered dominant pulse. These filtered dominant, recessive, dominant pulses do not need to occur in immediate \nsuccession. There is no timeout that will occur between filtered bits of the WUP. Once a full WUP has been \ndetected the device will continue to drive the RXD output low every time an additional filtered dominant signal is \nreceived from the bus.\nFor a dominant or recessive signal to be considered "filtered", the bus must continually remain in that state for \nmore than t WK_FILTER . Due to variability in the t WK_FILTER , the following three scenarios can exist:\n1.Bus signals that last less than t WK_FILTER(MIN)  will never be detected as part of a valid WUP\n2.Bus signals that last more than t WK_FILTER(MIN)  but less than t WK_FILTER(MAX)  may be detected as part of a \nvalid WUP\n3.Bus signals that last more than t WK_FILTER(MAX)  will always be detected as part of a valid WUP\nOnce the first filtered dominant signal is received, the device is now waiting on a filtered recessive signal, other \nbus traffic will not reset the bus monitor. Once the filtered recessive signal is received, the monitor is now waiting \non a second filtered dominant signal, and again other bus traffic will not reset the monitor. After reception of the \nfull WUP, the device will transition to driving the RXD output pin low for the remainder of any dominant signal that \nremains on the bus for longer than t WK_FILTER .\nBus V Diff\n\x95 tWK_FILTER \x95 tWK_FILTER \x95 tWK_FILTERBusFiltered\nDominantFiltered\nDominantFiltered\nRecessiveWake Up Pattern (WUP)\nRXD\x95 tWK_FILTER\n Filtered Dominant RXD Output\nBus Wake Via \nRXD Requests Bus Wake via \nRXD Request\nWaiting for \nFiltered \nRecessiveWaiting for \nFiltered \nDominant\nFigure 9-4.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n10.1 Application Information\nThese CAN transceivers are typically used in applications with a host microprocessor or FPGA that includes the \ndata link layer portion of the CAN protocol. Below are typical application configurations for both 5 V and 3.3 V \nmicroprocessor applications. The bus termination is shown for illustrative purposes.\n10.2 Typical Applications\nMCU or DSP\nCAN \nController\nCAN \nTransceiverNode 1\nMCU or DSP\nCAN \nController\nCAN \nTransceiverNode 2\nMCU or DSP\nCAN \nController\nCAN \nTransceiverNode 3\nMCU or DSP\nCAN \nController\nCAN \nTransceiverNode n\n(with termination)\nRTERMRTERM\nFigure 10-1. Typical CAN Bus Application\n10.2.1 Design Requirements\n10.2.1.1 Bus Loading, Length and Number of Nodes\nThe ISO 11898-2 Standard specifies a maximum bus length of 40 m and maximum stub length of 0.3 m. \nHowever, with careful design, users can have longer cables, longer stub lengths, and many more nodes to a \nbus. A large number of nodes requires transceivers with high input impedance such as the TCAN1042  family of \ntransceivers.\nMany CAN organizations and standards have scaled the use of CAN for applications outside the original ISO \n11898-2. They have made system-level trade-offs for data rate, cable length, and parasitic loading of the bus. \nExamples of some of these specifications are ARINC825, CANopen, DeviceNet and NMEA2000.\nThe TCAN1042  family is specified to meet the 1.5 V requirement with a 50 Ω load, incorporating the worst case \nincluding parallel transceivers. The differential input resistance of the TCAN1042  family is a minimum of 30 k Ω. \nIf 100 TCAN1042  family transceivers are in parallel on a bus, this is equivalent to a 300 Ω differential load worst \ncase. That transceiver load of 300 Ω in parallel with the 60 Ω gives an equivalent loading of 50 Ω. Therefore, \nthe TCAN1042  family theoretically supports up to 100 transceivers on a single bus segment. However, for CAN \nnetwork design margin must be given for signal loss across the system and cabling, parasitic loadings, network \nimbalances, ground offsets and signal integrity thus a practical maximum number of nodes is typically much \nlower. Bus length may also be extended beyond the original ISO 11898 standard of 40 m by careful system \ndesign and data rate tradeoffs. For example, CANopen network design guidelines allow the network to be up to \n1 km with changes in the termination resistance, cabling, less than 64 nodes and significantly lowered data rate.TCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\nThis flexibility in CAN network design is one of the key strengths of the various extensions and additional \nstandards that have been built on the original ISO 11898-2 CAN standard. In using this flexibility comes the \nresponsibility of good network design and balancing these tradeoffs.\n10.2.2 Detailed Design Procedures\n10.2.2.1 CAN Termination\nThe ISO 11898 standard specifies the interconnect to be a twisted pair cable (shielded or unshielded) with 120- Ω \ncharacteristic impedance (Z O). Resistors equal to the characteristic impedance of the line should be used to \nterminate both ends of the cable to prevent signal reflections. Unterminated drop lines (stubs) connecting nodes \nto the bus should be kept as short as possible to minimize signal reflections. The termination may be on the \ncable or in a node, but if nodes may be removed from the bus, the termination must be carefully placed so that \ntwo terminations always exist on the network.\nTermination may be a single 120- Ω resistor at the end of the bus, either on the cable or in a terminating node. \nIf filtering and stabilization of the common mode voltage of the bus is desired, then split termination may be \nused. (See Figure 10-2 ). Split termination improves the electromagnetic emissions behavior of the network by \neliminating fluctuations in the bus common-mode voltages at the start and end of message transmissions.\nCAN\nTransceiver\nCANLCANH\nRTERM/2\nCSPLITCAN\nTransceiverRTERM\nRTERM/2Standard Termination Split Termination\nCANLCANH\nCopyright © 2016, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 10-2.

ICC Dominant Current over V CC Supply Voltage\n11 Power Supply Recommendations\nThese devices are designed to operate from a V CC input supply voltage range between 4.5 V and 5.5 V. Some \ndevices have an output level shifting supply input, V IO, designed for a range between 3 V and 5.5 V. Both supply \ninputs must be well regulated. A bulk capacitance, typically 4.7 μF, should be placed near the CAN transceiver\'s \nmain V CC supply output, and in addition a bypass capacitor, typically 0.1 μF, should be placed as close to the \ndevice V CC and V IO supply terminals. This helps to reduce supply voltage ripple present on the outputs of the \nswitched-mode power supplies and also helps to compensate for the resistance and inductance of the PCB \npower planes and traces.www.ti.comTCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 29\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\nLayout\nRobust and reliable bus node design often requires the use of external transient protection device in order to \nprotect against EFT and surge transients that may occur in industrial environments. Because ESD and transients \nhave a wide frequency bandwidth from approximately 3 MHz to 3 GHz, high-frequency layout techniques must \nbe applied during PCB design. The family comes with high on-chip IEC ESD protection, but if higher levels of \nsystem level immunity are desired external TVS diodes can be used. TVS diodes and bus filtering capacitors \nshould be placed as close to the on-board connectors as possible to prevent noisy transient events from \npropagating further into the PCB and system.\n12.1 Layout Guidelines\n•Place the protection and filtering circuitry as close to the bus connector, J1, to prevent transients, ESD and \nnoise from propagating onto the board. In this layout example a transient voltage suppression (TVS) device, \nD1, has been used for added protection. The production solution can be either bi-directional TVS diode \nor varistor with ratings matching the application requirements. This example also shows optional bus filter \ncapacitors C4 and C5. Additionally (not shown) a series common mode choke (CMC) can be placed on the \nCANH and CANL lines between the transceiver U1 and connector J1.\n•Design the bus protection components in the direction of the signal path. Do not force the transient current to \ndivert from the signal path to reach the protection device.\n•Use supply (V CC) and ground planes to provide low inductance.\nNote\nHigh-frequency currents follows the path of least impedance and not the path of least resistance.\n•Use at least two vias for supply (V CC) and ground connections of bypass capacitors and protection devices to \nminimize trace and via inductance.\n•Bypass and bulk capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the supply terminals of transceiver, \nexamples are C1, C2 on the V CC supply and C6 and C7 on the V IO supply.\n•Bus termination: this layout example shows split termination. This is where the termination is split into two \nresistors, R6 and R7, with the center or split tap of the termination connected to ground via capacitor C3. Split \ntermination provides common mode filtering for the bus. When bus termination is placed on the board instead \nof directly on the bus, additional care must be taken to ensure the terminating node is not removed from the \nbus thus also removing the termination. See the application section for information on power ratings needed \nfor the termination resistor(s).\n•To limit current of digital lines, serial resistors may be used. Examples are R2, R3, and R4. These are not \nrequired.\n•Terminal 1: R1 is shown optionally for the TXD input of the device. If an open drain host processor is used, \nthis is mandatory to ensure the bit timing into the device is met.\n•Terminal 5: For "V" variants of the family, bypass capacitors should be placed as close to the pin as possible \n(example C6 and C7). For device options without V IO I/O level shifting, this pin is not internally connected and \ncan be left floating or tied to any existing net, for example a split pin connection.\n•Terminal 8: is shown assuming the mode terminal, STB, will be used. If the device will only be used in normal \nmode, R4 is not needed and R5 could be used for the pull down resistor to GND.TCAN1042H, TCAN1042HG\nTCAN1042HGV, TCAN1042HV\nSLLSES7D – MARCH 2016 – REVISED OCTOBER 2021 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TCAN1042H  TCAN1042HG  TCAN1042HGV  TCAN1042HV\n12.2 Layout Example\nGNDJ1U1U1\nR3R2\nRXDC2\nVCCTXD\nC3\nC1C6\nGND\nC7STB\nGNDGNDR4\nR7R6C4 C5D1\nR5 GND\nVIOVCC or VIO R1\n1\n2\n3\n4 5678\nFigure 12-1.
