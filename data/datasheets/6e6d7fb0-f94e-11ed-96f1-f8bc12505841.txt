The input \nphotodiode monitors, and th erefore stabiliz es, the light \noutput of the LED. As a result, the nonlinearity and drift \ncharacteristics of the LED can be virtually eliminated. The output photodiode produces a ph otocurrent that is linearly \nrelated to the light output of the LED. The close matching of \nthe photodiodes and advanced design of the package ensure the high linearity and stable gain characteristics of \nthe optocoupler.\nThe HCNR200/201 isolates analog signals in a wide variety \nof applications that requir e good stability, linearity, \nbandwidth, and low cost. The H CNR200/201 is flexible and, \nby appropriate design of the appl ication circuit, is capable of \noperating in many different modes, including unipolar/\nbipolar, AC/DC and inverting/noninverting. The \nHCNR200/201 is an excellent solution for many analog isolation problems.Features\n\uf06eLow nonlinearity: 0.01%\n\uf06eK3 (IPD2/IPD1) transfer gain\nHCNR200: ±15% \nHCNR201: ±5%\n\uf06eLow gain temperature coefficient: 65 ppm/°C\n\uf06eWide bandwidth – DC to >1 MHz\n\uf06eWorldwide safety approval\n– UL 1577 recognized (5 kV rms/1 min. rating)\n– CSA approved– IEC/EN/DIN EN 60747-5-5 approved \nV\nIORM =1 4 1 4Vpeak (option -050E/-350E/-550E)\n\uf06eSurface mount option available (Option #300)\n\uf06e8-pin DIP package – 0.400-in. spacing\n\uf06eAllows flexible circuit design\nApplications\n\uf06eLow cost analog isolation\n\uf06eTelecom: Modem, PBX\n\uf06eIndustrial process control:\nTransducer isolator\nIsolator for thermocouples 4 mA to 20 mA loop isolation\n\uf06eSMPS feedback loop, SMPS feedforward\n\uf06eMonitor motor supply voltage\n\uf06eMedical\nCAUTION!

The basic optocoupler consists of \nan LED and two photodiodes. The LED and one of the photodiodes (PD1) is on the input leadframe and the other \nphotodiode (PD2) is on the output leadframe. The package \nof the optocoupler is constructed so that each photodiode receives approximately the same amount of light from the \nLED.\nAn external feedback amplifier can be used with PD1 to \nmonitor the light output of t he LED and automatically adjust \nthe LED current to compensate for any nonlinearities or \nchanges in light output of the LED. The feedback amplifier \nacts to stabilize and linearize th e light output of the LED. The \noutput photodiode then conver ts the stable, linear light \noutput of the LED into a current, which can then be converted back into a voltage by another amplifier.\nFigure 13 a illustrates the basic circuit topology for \nimplementing a simple isolation amplifier using the HCNR200/201 optocoupler. Besides the optocoupler, two \nexternal op-amps and two resistors are required. This circuit \nis actually a bit too simple to function properly in an actual circuit, but it is quite useful  for explaining how the basic \nisolation amplifier circuit wo rks (a few more components \nand a circuit change are required to make a practical circuit, like the one shown in Figure 13 b).\nThe operation of the basic ci rcuit may not be immediately \nobvious just from inspecting Figure 13 a, particularly the \ninput part of the circuit. Stated briefly, amplifier A1 adjusts the LED current (I\nF), and therefore the current in PD1 (IPD1), \nto maintain its “+” input te rminal at 0V. For example, \nincreasing the input voltage would tend to increase the voltage of the “+” input terminal of A1 above 0V. A1 amplifies \nthat increase, causing I\nF to increase, as well as IPD1. \nBecause of the way that  PD1 is connected, IPD1 pulls the “+” \nterminal of the op-amp back toward ground. A1 continues to \nincrease IF until its “+” terminal is back at 0V. Assuming that \nA1 is a perfect op-amp, no curr ent flows into the inputs of \nA1; therefore, all of the curr ent flowing through R1 will flow \nthrough PD1. Because the “+” input of A1 is at 0V, the \ncurrent through R1, and therefore IPD1 as well, is equal to \nVIN/R 1 .\nEssentially, amplifier A1 adjusts IF so that\nIPD1 = VIN / R1.Notice that IPD1 depends only on the input voltage and the \nvalue of R1 and is independent of the light output \ncharacteristics of the LED. As the light output of the LED \nchanges with temperature, amplifier A1 adjusts IF to \ncompensate and maintain a constant current in PD1. Also \nnotice that IPD1 is exactly proportional to VIN, giving a very \nlinear relationship between the input voltage and the photodiode current.\nThe relationship between the input optical power and the \noutput current of a photodiode is  very linear. Therefore, by \nstabilizing and linearizing I\nPD1, the light output of the LED is \nalso stabilized and linearized.  And because light from the \nLED falls on both of the photodiodes, IPD2 will be stabilized \nas well.\nThe physical construction of the package determines the \nrelative amounts of light that fall on the two photodiodes and, therefore, the ratio of the photodiode currents. This \nresults in very stable operatio n over time and temperature. \nThe photodiode current ratio can be expressed as a constant, K, where\nK = I\nPD2 / IPD1\nAmplifier A2 and resistor R2 form a trans-resistance \namplifier that converts IPD2 back into a voltage, VOUT, where\nVOUT = IPD2 × R2\nCombining the above three equations yields an overall \nexpression relating the output voltage to the input voltage:\nVOUT / VIN = K × (R2 / R1)\nTherefore the relationship between VIN and VOUT is \nconstant, linear, and independent of the light output characteristics of the LED. Th e gain of the basic isolation \namplifier circuit can be adjusted simply by adjusting the ratio \nof R2 to R1. The parameter K (called K\n3 in the electrical \nspecifications) can be though t of as the gain of the \noptocoupler and is specified in the data sheet.\nRemember, the circuit in Figure 13 a is simplified to explain \nthe basic circuit operation. A practical circuit, more like \nFigure 13 b, will require a few addi tional components to \nstabilize the input part of the circ uit, to limit the LED current, \nor to optimize circuit per formance. Example application \ncircuits will be described la ter in the data sheet.\nHCNR200 and HCNR201  Data Sheet High-Linearity Analog Optocouplers\nBroadcom AV02-0886EN\n19Circuit Design Flexibility\nCircuit design with the HCNR 200/201 is very flexible \nbecause the LED and both photodiodes are accessible to the designer. This allows the designer to make performance \ntrade-offs that would otherwise be difficult to make with \ncommercially available isolation amplifiers (for example, bandwidth vs. accuracy vs. cost ). Analog isolation circuits \ncan be designed for applications that have either unipolar \n(for example, 0V to 10V) or bipolar (for example, ±10V) signals, with positive or negati ve input or output voltages. \nSeveral simplified circuit topol ogies illustrating the design \nflexibility of the HCNR200/2 01 are in this section.\nThe circuit in Figure 13 a is configured to be non-inverting \nwith positive input and output voltages. By changing the \npolarity of one or both of the photodiodes, the LED, or the op-amp inputs, it is possible  to implement other circuit \nconfigurations as well. Figure 14  shows how to change the \nbasic circuit to accommodate both positive and negative \ninput and output voltages. The input and output circuits can \nbe matched to achieve any combination of positive and \nnegative voltages, allowing for both inverting and non-inverting circuits.\nAll of the configurations described previously are unipolar \n(single polarity); the circuits cannot accommodate a signal that might swing both positive  and negative. It is possible, \nhowever, to use the HCNR 200/201 optocoupler to \nimplement a bipolar isolation amplifier. Two topologies that allow for bipolar operation are shown in Figure 15 .\nThe circuit in Figure 15 a uses two current sources to offset \nthe signal so that it appears to be unipolar to the optocoupler. Current source I\nOS1 provides enough offset to \nensure that IPD1 is always positive. The second current \nsource, IOS2, provides an offset of opposite polarity to obtain \na net circuit offset of zero. Current sources IOS1 and IOS2 \ncan be implemented simply as resistors connected to \nsuitable voltage sources.\nThe circuit in Figure 15 b uses two optocouplers to obtain \nbipolar operation. The first optocoupler handles the positive \nvoltage excursions, while the second optocoupler handles \nthe negative ones. The output photodiodes are connected in \nan antiparallel configuration so  that they produce output \nsignals of opposite polarity.The first circuit has the obvious advantage of requiring only \none optocoupler; however, the offset performance of the \ncircuit is dependent on the matching of IOS1 and IOS2 and is \nalso dependent on the gain of the optocoupler. Changes in the gain of the optocoupler dire ctly affect the offset of the \ncircuit.\nThe offset performance of th e second circuit, on the other \nhand, is much more stable; it is independent of optocoupler \ngain and has no matched current sources to worry about. \nHowever, the second circuit requires two optocouplers, separate gain adjustments for the positive and negative \nportions of the signal, and can exhibit crossover distortion \nnear 0V. The correct circuit to choose for an application would depend on the requirements of that particular \napplication. As with the basic isolation amplifier circuit in \nFigure 13 a, the circuits in Figure 15  are simplified and would \nrequire a few additional components to function properly. \nTwo example circuits that opera te with bipolar input signals \nare described in the next section.\nAs a final example of circuit design flexibility, the simplified \nschematics in Figure 16  illustrate how to implement 4 mA to \n20 mA analog current-loop transmitter and receiver circuits using the HCNR200/201 optocoupler. In these circuits, the \nloop side of the circuit is po wered entirely by the loop \ncurrent, eliminating the need for an isolated power supply.\nThe input and output circuits in Figure 16 a are the same as \nthe negative input and positiv e output circuits shown in \nFigure 14 c and Figure 14 b, except for the addition of R3 and \nzener diode D1 on the input side  of the circuit. D1 regulates \nthe supply voltage for the inpu t amplifier, while R3 forms a \ncurrent divider with R1 to scale the loop current down from 20 mA to an appropriate level for the input circuit (<50 µA).\nAs in the simpler circuits, the input amplifier adjusts the LED \ncurrent so that both of its input terminals are at the same \nvoltage. The loop current is then divided between R1 and R3. IPD1 is equal to the current  in R1 and is given by the \nfollowing equation:\nI\nPD1 = ILOOP  × R3 / (R1 + R3)\nCombining the above equation with the equations used for \nFigure 13 a yields an overall expression relating the output \nvoltage to the loop current:\nVOUT / ILOOP  = K × (R2 × R3) / (R1 + R3)\nHCNR200 and HCNR201  Data Sheet High-Linearity Analog Optocouplers\nBroadcom AV02-0886EN\n20Again, you can see that the re lationship is constant, linear, \nand independent of the ch aracteristics of the LED.\nThe 4 mA to 20 mA transmitter circuit in Figure 16 b is a little \ndifferent from the previous ci rcuits, particularly the output \ncircuit. The output circuit does not directly generate an \noutput voltage that is sensed by R2; it instead uses Q1 to \ngenerate an output current that flows through R3. This output current generates a voltage across R3, which is then \nsensed by R2. An analysis similar to the one above yields \nthe following expression relating output current to input voltage:\nI\nLOOP  / VIN = K × (R2 + R3) / (R1 × R3)\nThe preceding circui ts were presented to illustrate the \nflexibility in designing analog isolation circuits using the \nHCNR200/201. The next section presents several complete \nschematics to illustrate prac tical applications of the \nHCNR200/201.\nExample Application Circuits\nThe circuit shown in Figure 17  is a high-speed low-cost \ncircuit designed for use in the feedback path of switch-mode \npower supplies. This application requires good bandwidth, \nlow cost and stable gain, but does not require very high accuracy. This circuit is a good example of how a designer \ncan trade off accuracy to achieve improvements in \nbandwidth and cost. The circuit has a bandwidth of about 1.5 MHz with stable gain characteristics and requires few \nexternal components.\nAlthough it may not appear so at first glance, the circuit in \nFigure 17  is essentially the same as the circuit in \nFigure 13 a. Amplifier A1 is comprised of Q1, Q2, R3, and \nR4, while amplifier A2 is comp rised of Q3, Q4, R5, R6, and \nR7. The circuit operates in the same manner as well; the only difference is the performance of amplifiers A1 and A2. \nThe lower gains, higher input currents and higher offset \nvoltages affect the accuracy of the circuit, but not the way it \noperates. Because the basic circuit operation has not \nchanged, the circuit still has go od gain stability. The use of \ndiscrete transistors instead of  op-amps allowed the design \nto trade off accuracy to achieve good bandwidth and gain \nstability at low cost.To get into a little more detail ab out the circuit, R1 is selected \nto achieve an LED current of about 7 mA to 10 mA at the \nnominal input operating voltage according to the following \nequation:\nI\nF = (VIN / R1) / K1\nwhere K1 (that is, IPD1 / IF) of the optocoupler is typically \nabout 0.5%. R2 is then selected to achieve the desired output voltage according to the equation:\nV\nOUT / VIN = R2 / R1\nR4 and R6 improve the dynamic response (that is, stability) \nof the input and output circuits by lowering the local loop \ngains. R3 and R5 are selected to provide enough current to \ndrive the bases of Q2 and Q4. R7 is selected so that Q4 operates at about the same collector current as Q2.\nThe next circuit, shown in Figure 18 , is designed to achieve \nthe highest possible accuracy  at a reasonable cost. The \nhigh accuracy and wide dynamic range of the circuit is \nachieved by using low-cost precision op-amps with very low \ninput bias currents and offset voltages and is limited by the performance of the optocoupler . The circuit is designed to \noperate with input and output voltages from 1 mV to 10V.\nThe circuit operates in the same  way as the others. The only \nmajor differences are the two compensation capacitors and \nadditional LED drive circuitry. In the high-speed circuit \ndescribed previously, the input and output circuits are stabilized by reducing the local loop gain s of the input and \noutput circuits. Because reducing the loop gains would \ndecrease the accuracy of the circuit, two compensation capacitors, C1 and C2, are instead used to improve circuit stability. These capacitors also  limit the bandwidth of the \ncircuit to about 10 kHz and c an be used to reduce the output \nnoise of the circuit by reducing its bandwidth even further.\nThe additional LED drive circuitry (Q1 and R3 through R6) \nhelps to maintain the accuracy and bandwidth of the circuit \nover the entire range of in put voltages. Without these \ncomponents, the transconductan ce of the LED driver would \ndecrease at low input voltages and LED currents. This \nwould reduce the loop gain of the input circuit, reducing circuit accuracy and bandwidth. D1 prevents excessive \nreverse voltage from being applied to the LED when the \nLED turns off completely.\nHCNR200 and HCNR201  Data Sheet High-Linearity Analog Optocouplers\nBroadcom AV02-0886EN\n21No offset adjustment of the ci rcuit is necessary; the gain can \nbe adjusted to unity by simply adjusting the 50 k Ω \npotentiometer that is part of R2. Any OP-97 type of op-amp \ncan be used in the circuit, such as the LT1097 from Linear Technology or the AD705 from  Analog Devices, both of \nwhich offer pA bias currents, µV offset voltages and are low \ncost. The input terminals of the op-amps and the photodiodes are connected in the circuit using Kelvin \nconnections to help ensure the accuracy of the circuit.\nThe next two circuits illustra te how the HCNR200/201 can \nbe used with bipolar input signals. The isolation amplifier in \nFigure 18  is a practical implementation of the circuit shown \nin Figure 15 b. It uses two optocoup lers, OC1 and OC2; OC1 \nhandles the positive portions of  the input signal and OC2 \nhandles the negative portions.\nDiodes D1 and D2 help reduce crossover distortion by \nkeeping both amplifiers active during both positive and \nnegative portions of the input signal. For example, when the \ninput signal positive, optocoupler OC1 is active while OC2 is turned off. However, the am plifier controlling OC2 is kept \nactive by D2, allowing it to turn on OC2 more rapidly when \nthe input signal goes negative,  thereby reducing crossover \ndistortion.\nBalance control R1 adjusts the relative gain for the positive \nand negative portions of the input signal, gain control R7 adjusts the overall gain of the isolation amplifier, and \ncapacitors C1-C3 provide co mpensation to stabilize the \namplifiers.\nThe final circuit shown in Figure 20  isolates a bipolar analog \nsignal using only one optocoupler and generates two output \nsignals: an analog signal proportional to the magnitude of \nthe input signal and a digital signal corresponding to the sign of the input signal. This circ uit is especially useful for \napplications where the output of  the circuit is applied to an \nanalog-to-digital converter. The primary advantages of this circuit are very good linearity and offset, with only a single \ngain adjustment and no offset or balance adjustments.\nTo achieve very high linearity  for bipolar signals, the gain \nshould be exactly the same for both positive and negative \ninput polarities. This circuit achieves excellent linearity by \nusing a single optocoupler and a single input resistor, which guarantees identical gain for both positive and negative polarities of the input signal. This precise matching of gain \nfor both polarities is much mo re difficult to  obtain when \nseparate components are used for the different input \npolarities, such as is the previous circuit.\nThe circuit in Figure 20  is actually very similar to the \nprevious circuit. As mentioned previously, only one \noptocoupler is used. Because a photodiode can conduct current in only one direction, two diodes (D1 and D2) are \nused to steer the input current to the appropriate terminal of \ninput photodiode PD1 to allow bipolar input currents. Normally, the forward voltage drops of the diodes would \ncause a serious linearity or accuracy problem. However, an \nadditional amplifier provides an  appropriate offset voltage to \nthe other amplifiers that exactly cancels the diode voltage \ndrops to maintain circuit accuracy.\nDiodes D3 and D4 perform tw o different functions; the \ndiodes keep their respective amplifiers active independent \nof the input signal polarity (as in the previous circuit), and \nthey also provide the feedback signal to PD1 that cancels the voltage drops of diodes D1 and D2.\nEither a comparator or an extra op-amp can be used to \nsense the polarity of the input signal and drive an inexpensive digital optocoupler, such as a 6N139.\nIt is also possible to convert th is circuit into a fully bipolar \ncircuit (with a bipolar output si gnal) by using the output of \nthe 6N139 to drive some CMOS switches to switch the \npolarity of PD2 depending on the polarity of the input signal, \nobtaining a bipolar output voltage swing.\nHCNR200/201 SPICE Model\nFigure 21  is the net list of a SPICE macro-model for the \nHCNR200/201 high-linearity optocoupler. The macro-model \naccurately reflects the primary characteristics of the HCNR200/201 and should facilitate the design and \nunderstanding of circuits  using the HCNR200/201 \noptocoupler.\nBroadcom, the pulse logo, Connecting everything, Avago Tech nologies, Avago, and the A logo are among the trademarks \nof Broadcom and/or its affiliates in the United States, certain ot her countries, and/or the EU. \nCopyright © 2014–2021 Broadcom.
