Shocks & Vibrations  \nExcessive mechanical shocks and or vibrations during handling as well as manual and automatic \nassembly must be avoided.  \nIf accidently, the component was dropped or subject to strong shock, component should be verified \nthat the electrical function is still within the specification and still hermetically sealed.  \n \n3. Thermal Shocks  \nAvoid steep temperature gradients. It might lead to breakage of the crystal blank  \nInfrared reflow processes in general are safe.  \n \n4. Soldering & Cleaning \n \nMaximum Reflow Condition in accordance with JEDEC STD -020C  \n \n \n \nAvoid washing or welding processes using Ultrasonic energy. These processes can damage the \ncrystal due to mechanical resonance of the crystal blanks.  \n \n5. Coating \nUsing resin may have an impact on the oscillator characteristics.  \nIf resin is used, please contact QuartzCom or our representative for more information.  \nIn situations where resin would be used without contacting us in advance,  \nQuartzCom will not be responsible for any damages caused to the components or and injuries caused to people.  \n \n'}]
