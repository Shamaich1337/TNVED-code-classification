It has\ntrue single-supply capability with an input voltage range extending\n200 mV below the negative rail and within 1 V of the positive rail.\n5V\n2.5V\n0V200ns 1V\nFigure 1. Output Swing: G = –1, V S = 5 VThe output voltage swing extends to within 50 mV of each rail,\nproviding the maximum output dynamic range. Additionally, it\nfeatures gain flatness of 0.1 dB to 30 MHz while offering differ-ential gain and phase error of 0.03% and 0.03 ° on a single 5 V\nsupply. This makes the AD8041 ideal for professional video\nelectronics such as cameras, video switchers, or any high speedportable equipment. The AD8041’s low distortion and fast settling\nmake it ideal for buffering high speed A-to-D converters.\nThe AD8041 has a high speed disable feature useful for mul-\ntiplexing or for reducing power consumption (1.5 mA). Thedisable logic interface is compatible with CMOS or open-\ncollector logic. The AD8041 offers a low power supply current\nof 5.8 mA maximum and can run on a single 3 V power supply.These fe atures are ideally suited for portable and battery-\npowered applications where size and power are critical.\nThe wide bandwidth of 160 MHz along with 160 V/ µs of slew\nrate on a single 5 V supply make the AD8041 useful in manygeneral-purpose high speed applications where dual power\nsupplies of up to ±6 V and single supplies from 3 V to 12 V are\nneeded. The AD8041 is available in 8-lead PDIP and SOIC\nover the industrial temperature range of –40 °C to +85 °C.\nFREQUENCY (MHz)VS = 5V\nG = +2\nRF = 400/H9024 0\n100NORMALIZED GAIN (dB)\n80 60 40 20 02\n1\n–2–1\n–8–7–6–5–4–3\nFigure 2.

Exceeding this limit temporarily\nmay cause a shift in parametric performance due to a change inthe stresses exerted on the die by the package. Exceeding a\njunction temperature of 175 °C for an extended period can result\nin device failure.\nWhile the AD8041 is internally short-circuit protected, this may\nnot be sufficient to guarantee that the maximum junction tem-\nperature (150 °C) is not exceeded under all conditions. To\nensure proper operation, it is necessary to observe the maximum\npower derating curves.\nMAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE ( /H11543C)2.0\n1.5\n0\n–50 90–40 –30 –20 –10 0 10 20 30 50 60 70 80 401.0\n0.5 8-LEAD PDIP PACKAGE\n 8-LEAD SOIC PACKAGE TJ = 150 /H11543C\nFigure 3.

The amplifier must recover from this over-\ndrive condition. As shown in Figure 4, the AD8041 recovers\nwithin 50 ns from negative overdrive and within 25 ns frompositive overdrive.\n5.0V\n2.5V\n0V40ns 50mV OUTPUT \n INPUT \n G = +2\n VS = 5V\nFigure 4. Overdrive Recovery\nCircuit Description\nThe AD8041 is fabricated on Analog Devices’ proprietary\neXtra-Fast Complementary Bipolar (XFCB) process, which\nenables the construction of PNP and NPN transistors with similarf\nT in the 2 GHz to 4 GHz region. The process is dielectrically\nisolated to eliminate the parasitic and latch-up problems causedby junction isolation. These features allow the construction ofhigh frequency, low distortion amplifiers with low supply currents.\nThis design uses a differential output input stage to maximize\nbandwidth and headroom (see Figure 5). The smaller signalswings required on the first stage outputs (nodes S1P, S1N) reducethe effect of nonlinear currents due to junction capacitances and\nimprove the distortion performance. With this design harmonic\ndistortion of better than –85 dB @ 1 MHz into 100 Ω with V\nOUT =\n2 V p-p (G ain = +2) on a single 5 V supply is achieved.\nThe complementary common-emitter design of the output stage\nprovides excellent load drive without the need for emitter follow-\ners, thereby improving the output range of the device consider-\nably with respect to conventional op amps. High output drive\ncapability is provided by injecting all output stage predriver\ncurrents directly into the bases of the output devices Q8 andQ36. Biasing of Q8 and Q36 is accomplished by I8 and I5,\nalong with a common-mode feedback loop (not shown). This\ncircuit topology allows the AD8041 to drive 50 mA of output\ncurrent with the outputs within 0.5 V of the supply rails.\nOn the input side, the device can handle voltages from –0.2 V\nbelow the negative rail to within 1.2 V of the positive rail. Exceed-\ning these values will not cause phase reversal; however, the\ninput ESD devices will begin to conduct if the input voltages\nexceed the rails by greater than 0.5 V.\nA “Nested Integrator” topology is used in the AD8041 (see\nthe small-signal schematic in Figure 6). The output stage can\nbe modeled as an ideal op amp with a single-pole response and\na unity-gain frequency set by transconductance g\nm2 andCapacitor C9. R1 is the output resistance of the input stage; g m\nis the input transconductance. C7 and C9 provide Miller com-\npensation for the overall op amp. The unity gain frequency will\noccur at g m/C9. Solving the node equations for this circuit yields:\n    V\nViA\nsR C A sg\nCOUT\nm=\n++ ×\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8ef\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\uf8fa+\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f70\n19 2 1 1312([ ( ) ] )\nwhere A0 = g mgm2 R2 R1 (Open-Loop Gain of Op Amp)\nA2 = g m2 R2 (Open-Loop Gain of Output Stage)\nThe first pole in the denominator is the dominant pole of the\namplifier and occurs at about 180 Hz. This equals the inputstage output impedance R1 multiplied by the Miller-multiplied\nvalue of C9. The second pole occurs at the unity-gain bandwidth\nof the output stage, which is 250 MHz. This type of architecture\nallows more open-loop gain and output drive to be obtainedthan a standard two-stage architecture would allow.\nOutput Impedance\nThe low frequency open-loop output impedance of the common\nemitter output stage used in this design is approximately 6.5 k Ω.\nWhile this is significantly higher than a typical emitter followeroutput stage, when connected with feedback, the output imped-ance is reduced by the open-loop gain of the op amp. With\n110 dB of open-loop gain, the output impedance is reduced\nto less than 0.1 Ω. At higher frequencies, the output impedance\nwill rise as the open-loop gain of the op amp drops; however, the\noutput also becomes capacitive due to the integrator capacitors\nC9 and C3. This prevents the output impedance from ever becom-\ning excessively high (see TPC 15), which can cause stability\nproblems when driving capacitive loads. In fact, the AD8041\nhas excellent cap-load drive capability for a high frequency op\namp. TPC 22 demonstrates that the AD8041exhibits a 45 °\nmargin while driving a 20 pF direct capacitive load. In addition,\nrunning the part at higher gains will also improve the capacitive\nload drive capability of the op amp.\nS1N\nR21 R3VEE\nQ11\nQ3I10\nR26 R39\nQ5 Q4\nQ40\nI7R2 R15\nQ13 Q17\nR5 C7Q2S1PQ22\nQ7\nQ21\nQ24R23 R27I2 I3 I1\nQ51Q25 Q50\nQ39\nQ47Q27Q31Q23I9\nI5\nVEE\nVCCI8Q36\nQ8VOUTC3\nC9VCC\nVINP\nVINN\nVEE\nFigure 5.

If the disable pin is left floating, the part is enabled andwill perform normally. If the disable pin is pulled to 2.5 V (min)below the positive supply, output of the AD8041 will be disabled\nand the nominal supply current will drop to less than 1.6 mA.\nFor best isolation, the disable pin should be pulled to as low avoltage as possible; ideally, the negative supply rail.\nThe disable pin on the AD8041 allows it to be configured as a 2:1\nmux as shown in Figure 7 and can be used to switch many types of\nhigh speed signals. Higher order multiplexers can also be built.\nThe break-before-make switching time is approximately 50 ns to\ndisable the output and 300 ns to enable the output.\n6\n47 3\n2AD8041\n330/H902450/H902410/H9262F5V\n330/H90248\n6\n47 3\n2AD8041\n330/H902450/H902410/H9262F5V\n330/H90248\n13 12 11 10\n74HC0450/H9024G = +2\nG = +2CH0\n5MHz\nCH1\n10MHz\nFigure 7. 2:1 Multiplexer10\n0%100\n90\n200ns 1V VS = 5V\nFigure 8. 2:1 Multiplexer Performance\nSingle-Supply A/D Conversion\nFigure 9 shows the AD8041 d riving the analog inputs of the\nAD9050 in a dc-coupled system with single-ended signals.

FFT Output of Circuit in Figure 9\nREV. BAD8041\n–13–APPLICATIONS\nRGB Buffer\nThe AD8041 can provide buffering of RGB signals that include\nground while operating from a single 3 V or 5 V supply.\nThe signals that drive an RGB monitor are usually supplied by\ncurrent output DACs that operate from a 5 V only supply. These\ncan triple DACs like the ADV7120 and ADV7122 from Analog\nDevices or integrate into the graphics controller IC as in mostPCs these days.\nDuring the horizontal blanking interval, the currents output\nfrom the DACs go to zero and the RGB signals are pulled to\nground via the termination resistors. If more than one RGB\nmonitor is desired, it cannot simply be connected in parallelbecause it will provide an additional termination. Therefore,\nbuffering must be provided before connecting a second monitor.\nSince the RGB signals include ground as part of their dynamic\noutput range, it has previously been required to use a dual-supply op amp to provide this buffering. In some systems, this is\nthe only component that requires a negative supply, so it can be\nquite inconvenient to incorporate this multiple monitor feature.\nFigure 11 shows a schematic of one channel of a single-supply,\ngain-of-two buffer for driving a second RGB monitor. No cur-\nrent is required when the amplifier output is at ground. The\ntermination resistor at the monitor helps pull the output downat low voltage levels.\n6\n473\n2AD8041\n1k/H9024\n75/H902410/H9262F\n8 75/H9024R, G OR BNC0.1/H9262F\n1k/H9024\nPRIMARY RGB\nMONITOR75/H9024\nSECOND RGB\nMONITOR3V OR 5V\nFigure 11.

Since the sync tips of a compositevideo signal extend below ground, the input must be ac-coupled\nand shifted positively to provide signal swing during these nega-tive excursions in a single-supply configuration.\nThe input is terminated in 75 Ω and ac-coupled via C\nIN to a\nvoltage divider that provides the dc bias point to the input.\nSetting the optimal bias point requires some understanding of\nthe nature of composite video signals and the video performance\nof the AD8041.\nSignals of bounded peak-to-peak amplitude that vary in duty\ncycle require larger dynamic swing capability than their peak-to-\npeak amplitude after ac coupling. As a worst case, the dynamic\nsignal swing required will approach twice the peak-to-peak value.\nThe two bounding cases are for a duty cycle that is mostly low,\nbut occasionally goes high at a fraction of a percent duty cycle\nand vice versa.\nComposite video is not quite this demanding. One bounding\nextreme is for a signal that is mostly black for an entire framebut has a white (full intensity), minimum width spike at least\nonce per frame.\nThe other extreme is for a video signal t hat is full white every-\nwhere. The blanking intervals and sync tips of such a signal will\nhave neg ative going excursions in com pliance with composite\nvideo specifications. The combination of horizontal and verticalblanking intervals limit such a signal to being at its highest level(white) for only about 75% of the time.\nAs a result of the duty cycle variations between the two extremes\npresented above, a 1 V p-p composite video signal that is multi-\nplied by a gain of two requires about 3.2 V p-p of dynamic voltage\nswing at the output for an op amp to pass a composite videosignal of arbitrary duty cycle without distortion.\nSome circuits use a sync tip clamp along with ac coupling to\nhold the sync tips at a relatively constant level in order to lower\nthe amount of dynamic signal swing required. However, thesecircuits can have artifacts like sync tip compression unless they\nare driven by sources with very low output impedance.\n6\n473\n2AD8041\nRF\n1k/H902410k/H902410/H9262F5V\n75/H9024COMPOSITE\nVIDEO IN\nNC0.1/H9262F\nRT\n75/H902481000/H9262F\n0.1/H9262F4.99k/H9024\n10/H9262F 4.99k/H9024\n47/H9262F\nRG\n1k/H9024\n220/H9262F75/H9024\nCOAX\nRL\n75/H9024VOUT\nFigure 13. Single-Supply Composite Video Line Driver\nThe AD8041 not only has ample signal swing capability to\nhandle the dynamic range required without using a sync tipclamp but also has good video specifications like differential\ngain and differential phase when buffering these signals in an ac-coupled configuration.\nREV. B –14–AD8041\nTo test this, the differential gain and differential phase were\nmeasured for the AD8041 while the supplies were varied. As the\nlower supply is raised to approach the video signal, the first effect\nto be observed is that the sync tips become compressed beforethe differential gain and differential phase are adversely affected.Thus, there must be adequate swing in the negative direction to\npass the sync tips without compression.\nAs the upper supply is lowered to approach the video, the differ-\nential gain and differential phase were not significantly adverselyaffected until the difference between the peak video output and\nthe supply reached 0.6 V. Thus, the highest video level should\nbe kept at least 0.6 V below the positive supply rail.\nTaking the above into account, it was found that the optimal\npoint to bias the noninverting input is at 2.2 V dc. Operating at\nthis point, the worst-case differential gain is measured at 0.06%\nand the worst-case differential phase is 0.06 °.\nThe ac coupling capacitors used in the circuit at first glance\nappear quite large. A composite video signal has a lower fre-\nquency band edge of 30 Hz. The resistances at the various accoupling points—especially at the output—are quite small. Inorder to minimize phase shifts and baseline tilt, the large value\ncapacitors are required. For video system performance that is\nnot to be of the highest quality, the value of these capacitors canbe reduced by a factor of up to five with only a slightly observ-\nable change in the picture quality.\nSync Stripper\nSome RGB monitor systems use only three cables total and\ncarry the synchronizing signals along with the green (G) signal\non the same cable. The sync signals are pulses that go in the\nnegative direction from the blanking level of the G signal.\nIn some applications like prior to digitizing component video\nsignals with A/D converters, it is desirable to remove or strip thesync portion from the G signal. Figure 14 is a schematic of a\ncircuit using the AD8041 running on a single 5 V supply that\nperforms this function.\nAD8041\nR2\n1k/H902410/H9262F 0.1/H9262F\n0.8V\n(2X VBLANK)5V\n75/H9024VIN75/H9024\n75/H9024\n(MONITOR)\nR1\n1k/H90247\n63\n24GREEN W/SYNC\nVBLANK +0.4\nGROUNDGREEN W/OUT SYNC\nGROUND\nFigure 14.

Single-Supply Sync Stripper\nThe reference voltage for R1 should be twice the dc blankinglevel of the G signal. If the blanking level is at ground and thesync tip is negative as in some dual-supply systems, then R1 can\nbe tied to ground. In either case, the output will have the sync\nremoved and have the blanking level at ground.\nLayout Considerations\nThe specified high speed performance of the AD8041 requires\ncareful attention to board layout and component selection.\nProper RF design techniques and low-pass parasitic component\nselection are necessary.\nThe PCB should have a ground plane covering all unused portions\nof the component side of the board to provide a low impedance\npath. The ground plane should be removed from the area near\nthe input pins to reduce the stray capacitance.\nChip capacitors should be used for the supply bypassing.\nOne end should be connected to the ground plane and the other\nwithin 1/8 inch of each power pin. An additional large (0.47 µF\nto 10 µF) tantalum electrolytic capacitor should be connected in\nparallel, but not necessarily so close, to supply current for fast,large signal changes at the output.\nThe feedback resistor should be located close to the inverting\ninput pin in order to keep the stray capacitance at this node to a\nminimum. Capacitance variations of less than 1 pF at the inverting\ninput will significantly affect high speed performance.\nStripline design techniques should be used for long signal traces\n(greater than about 1 inch). These should be desi gned with a\ncharacteristic impedance of 50 Ω or 75 Ω and be properly termi-\nnated at each end.\nREV.
