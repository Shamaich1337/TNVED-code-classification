### Component Summary: LFCG-92+

**Description:**
The LFCG-92+ is a low pass filter designed for RF applications, specifically operating within a frequency range of DC to 990 MHz. It is constructed using Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology, which provides excellent temperature stability and low insertion loss. This component is primarily used for harmonic rejection in VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers, as well as in laboratory settings.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; however, the RF power input is rated at 2W at 25°C, derating to 1W at 100°C.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; current handling is typically inferred from power ratings.
- **Power Consumption:** RF Power Input: 2W (derated to 1W at 100°C).
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to +100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to +100°C.
- **Package Type:** 0805 (2.0 x 1.25 mm) ceramic package.
- **Insertion Loss:** 
  - DC to 990 MHz: 0.4 dB (typical), 0.8 dB (maximum).
- **VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio):** 
  - DC to 990 MHz: 1.45:1 (maximum).
- **Cut-off Frequency (F2):** 1400 MHz with an attenuation of 3.0 dB.
- **Stop Band Rejection Loss:**
  - F3 (1700 MHz): 30 dB.
  - F4-F5 (1800-2700 MHz): 30-40 dB.
  - F6 (5000 MHz): 50 dB.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Special Features:**
- Low insertion loss of 0.4 dB typical.
- Small size (0805 package).
- Temperature stable due to LTCC construction.
- RoHS compliant.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in RF circuits to filter out unwanted harmonic frequencies.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Essential for ensuring signal integrity by allowing only desired frequencies to pass while attenuating higher frequencies.
- **Laboratory Use:** Suitable for testing and measurement applications where precise frequency filtering is required.

This summary encapsulates the essential characteristics and applications of the LFCG-92+ low pass filter, making it a valuable component for RF design and implementation.
