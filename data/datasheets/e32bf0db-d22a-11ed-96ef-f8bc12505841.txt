The CY2305 is an 8-pin version of the\nCY2309. It accepts one reference input, and drives out five low\nskew clocks. The -1H versions of each device operate at up to\n100-/133 MHz frequencies, and have higher drive than the -1\ndevices. All parts have on-chip PLLs which lock to an input clo ck\non the REF pin. The PLL feedback is on-chip and is obtained\nfrom the CLKOUT pad.\nThe CY2309 has two banks of four outputs each, which can be\ncontrolled by the select inputs as shown in Select Input Decoding\non page 5. If all output clocks are not required, BankB can be\nthree-stated. The select input s also allow the input clock to b e\ndirectly applied to the outputs for chip and system testing\npurposes.\nThe CY2305 and CY2309 PLLs enter a power-down mode when\nthere are no rising edges on the REF input. In th is state, the\noutputs are three-stated and the PLL is turned off, resulting i n\nless than 25.0 μA current draw for these parts. The CY2309 PLL\nshuts down in one additio nal case as shown in Select Input\nDecoding  on page 5.\nMultiple CY2305 and CY2309 devices can accept the same input\nclock and distribute it. In this case, the skew between the out puts\nof two devices is guaranteed  to be less t han 700 ps.\nThe CY2305/CY2309 is available in two or three different\nconfigurations, as shown in Ordering Information  on page 16.\nThe CY2305-1/CY2309-1 is the base part. The CY2305-1H/CY2309-1H is the high-drive version of the -1, and its rise and\nfall times are much faster than the -1.\nFor a complete list of re lated documentation, click here.\nPLL MUX\nSelect Input REF\nS2\nS1CLKA1\nCLKA2\nCLKA3\nCLKA4\nCLKB1\nCLKB2\nCLKB3\nCLKB4DecodingCLKOUTLogic Block Diagram\nDocument Number: 38-07140 Rev. *Y Page 2 of 25 CY2305\nCY2309\nContents\nPin Diagram ................................................... ....................3\nPin Description ............................................... ..................3\nPin Diagram ................................................... ....................4\nPin Description ............................................... ..................4\nSelect Input Decoding ......................................... .............5\nZero Delay and Skew Control ................................... .......5\nAbsolute Maximum Conditions ................................... ....6\nOperating Conditions .......................................... .............6\nElectrical Characteristics .................................... .............6\nOperating Conditions .......................................... .............7\nElectrical Characteristics .................................... .............7\nTest Circuits ................................................. .....................8\nThermal Resistance ............................................ ..............8\nTypical Duty Cycle and IDD Trends .................................9\nTypical Duty Cycle and IDD Trends ...............................10\nSwitching Characteristics ..................................... .........11\nSwitching Characteristics ..................................... .........12\nSwitching Characteristics ..................................... .........13\nSwitching Characteristics ..................................... .........14\nSwitching Waveforms ........................................... .........15Ordering Information .......................................... ............ 16\nOrdering Information .......................................... ............ 16\nOrdering Code Definitions ..................................... .... 17\nPackage Drawing and Dimensions ............................... 1 8\nAcronyms ...................................................... .................. 20\nDocument Conventions .......................................... ....... 20\nUnits of Measure .............................................. ......... 20\nErrata ........................................................ ....................... 21\nPart Numbers Affected ......................................... ..... 21\nCY2305/CY2309 Qualification St atus ......... .............. 22\nCY2305/CY2309 Errata Summary  .............. .............. 22\nDocument History Page ......................................... ........ 23\nSales, Solutions, and Legal Information ...................... 2 5\nWorldwide Sales and Design S upport ......... .............. 25\nProducts ...................................................... .............. 25\nPSoC® Solutions .................................................... ... 25\nCypress Developer Community . ................................ 25\nTechnical Support ........... .................................. ........ 25\nDocument Number: 38-07140 Rev. *Y Page 3 of 25 CY2305\nCY2309\nPin Diagram\nFigure 1.  8-pin SOIC pinout\nCY2305\n1\n2\n3\n4 58\n7\n6REF\nCLK2\nCLK1\nGNDVDDCLKOUT\nCLK4\nCLK3\nPin Description\nFor CY2305\nPin Signal Description\n1 REF[1] Input reference frequency, 5-V tolerant input\n2 CLK2[2] Buffered clock output\n3 CLK1[2] Buffered clock output\n4 GND Ground\n5 CLK3[2] Buffered clock output\n6VDD 3.3-V supply\n7 CLK4[2] Buffered clock output\n8  CLKOUT[2] Buffered clock output, int ernal feedback on this pin\nNotes\n1.

Input to CLKA/CL KB Delay vs. Loading Difference  between CLKOUT and CLKA/CLKB Pins \nZero Delay and Skew Control\nAll outputs must be uniformly loaded to achieve zero delay betw een the input and output. Because the CLKOUT pin is the interna l\nfeedback to the PLL, its relative  loading can adjust the input- output delay. This is sh own in the above graph.\nFor applications requiring zero input-output delay, all outputs , including CLKOUT, must be equally loaded. Even if CLKOUT is n ot\nused, it must have a capacitive load, equal to that on other ou tputs, for obtaining zero input -output delay. If input to outpu t delay\nadjustments are required, use Figure 3  to calculate loading differences  between the CLKOUT pin and ot her outputs.

### Component Summary: CY2309SXI-1H

**Manufacturer:** Cypress Semiconductor (now part of Infineon Technologies)

**Description:**
The CY2309SXI-1H is a low-cost, 3.3V zero delay buffer designed to distribute high-speed clocks. It features a 16-pin SOIC package and is capable of driving multiple low skew outputs. The device is particularly suitable for applications requiring precise clock distribution with minimal delay and jitter.

**Key Specifications:**

- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (VDD): 3.0V to 3.6V

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Supply Current (IDD) at 66.67 MHz: 35.0 mA (unloaded outputs)
  - Power-down supply current (IDD in PD mode): 25.0 μA

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Typical power consumption in active mode is dependent on load and frequency, with a maximum of 35.0 mA at 66.67 MHz.

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Industrial: -40°C to +85°C

- **Package Type:**
  - 16-pin SOIC (150 mils)

- **Special Features:**
  - Zero input-output propagation delay
  - 60 ps typical cycle-to-cycle jitter (high drive)
  - Multiple low skew outputs (up to 9 outputs)
  - On-chip phase-locked loop (PLL) for clock synchronization
  - Test mode to bypass PLL for testing purposes
  - Power-down mode with low current draw

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level 1 per JEDEC J-STD-020E

### Typical Applications:
The CY2309SXI-1H is typically used in applications that require high-speed clock distribution, such as:
- **Computer Systems:** Compatible with Pentium-based systems and PCI bus frequencies.
- **Networking Equipment:** For distributing clock signals in routers and switches.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Used in devices requiring synchronized clock signals for various components.
- **Industrial Automation:** For precise timing in control systems and data acquisition.

This component is ideal for scenarios where low skew and minimal propagation delay are critical, ensuring reliable performance in high-speed digital circuits.
