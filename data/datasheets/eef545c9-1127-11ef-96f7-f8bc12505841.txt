Typical DDR−3 Application Schematic\nFigure 2. Block Diagram\n\nNCP51400, NCV51400\nwww. onsemi.com\n6General\nThe NCP51400 is a sink/source tracking termination\nregulator specifically designed for low input voltage andlow external component count systems where space is a key\napplication parameter. The NCP51400 integrates ahigh−performance, low−dropout (LDO) linear regulator\nthat is capable of both sourcing and sinking current. The\nLDO regulator employs a fast feedback loop so that smallceramic capacitors can be used to support the fast loadtransient response. To achieve tight regulation withminimum effect of trace resistance, a remote sensingterminal, V\nTTS, should be connected to the positive terminal\nof the output capacitors as a separate trace from the highcurrent path from V\nTT.\nVRI − Generation of Internal Voltage Reference\nThe output voltage, V TT, is regulated to V RO. When V RI\nis configured for standard DDR termination applications,V\nRI can be set by an external equivalent ratio voltage divider\nconnected to the memory supply bus (V DDQ). The\nNCP51400 supports V RI voltage from 0.5 V to 1.8 V ,\nmaking it versatile and ideal for many types of low−powerLDO applications.\nVRO − Reference Output\nWhen it is configured for DDR termination applications,\nVRO generates the DDR V TT reference voltage for the\nmemory application. It is capable of supporting both asourcing and sinking load of 10 mA. V\nRO becomes active\nwhen V RI voltage rises to 435 mV and V CC is above the\nUVLO threshold. When V RO is less than 360 mV , it is\ndisabled and subsequently discharges to GND through an\ninternal 10 k /C0087 MOSFET. V RO is independent of the EN pin\nstate.\nSoft Start\nThe soft−start function of the V TT pin is achieved via a\ncurrent clamp. The current clamp allows the outputcapacitors to be charged with low and constant current,\nproviding a linear ramp−up of the output voltage. When\nV\nTT is outside of the power good window, the current\nclamp level is one−half of the full over−current limit (OCL)\nlevel. When V TT rises or falls within the P GOOD  window, the\ncurrent clamp level switches to the full OCL level.\nThe soft−start function is completely symmetrical; it\nworks not only from GND to the V RO voltage but also from\nPVCC to the V RO voltage.\nEN − Enable Control\nWhen EN is driven high, the NCP51400 V TT regulator\nbegins normal operation. When EN is driven low, V TT is\ndischarges to GND through an internal 18 /C0087 MOSFET.\nVREF remains on when EN is driven low.PGOOD  − PowerGood\nThe NCP51400 provides an open−drain P GOOD  output\nthat goes high when the V TT output is within ±20% of V RO.\nPGOOD  de−asserts within 10 /C0109s after the output exceeds the\nlimits of the PowerGood window. During initial V TT\nstartup, P GOOD  asserts high 2 ms after the V TT enters power\ngood window. Because P GOOD  is an open−drain output, a\n100 k/C0087, pull−up resistor between P GOOD  and a stable active\nsupply voltage rail is required.\nThe LDO has a constant over−current limit (OCL). Note\nthat the OCL level reduces by one−half when the outputvoltage is not within the power good window. This reduction\nis non−latch protection. For V\nCC under−voltage lockout\n(UVLO) protection, the NCP51400 monitors V CC voltage.\nWhen the V CC voltage is lower than the UVLO threshold\nvoltage, both the V TT and V RO regulators are powered off.\nThis shutdown is also non−latch protection.\nThermal Shutdown with Hysteresis\nIf the NCP51400 is to operate in elevated temperatures for\nlong durations, care should be taken to ensure that the\nmaximum operating junction temperature is not exceeded.To guarantee safe operation, the NCP51400 provideson−chip thermal shutdown protection. When the chip\njunction temperature exceeds 150 °C, the part will shutdown.\nWhen the junction temperature falls back to 125 °C, the\ndevice resumes normal operation. If the junctiontemperature exceeds the thermal shutdown threshold then\nthe V\nTT and V RO regulators are both shut off, discharged by\nthe internal discharge MOSFETs. The shutdown is anon−latch protection.\nTracking Startup and Shutdown\nThe NCP51400 also supports tracking startup and\nshutdown when EN is tied dir ectly to the system bus and not\nused to turn on or turn off the device. During trackingstartup, V\nTT follows V RO once V RI voltage is greater than\n435 mV . V RI follows the rise of V DDQ memory supply rail\nvia a voltage divider. The typical soft−start time for the\nVDDQ memory supply rail is approximately 3 ms, however\nit may vary depending on the system configuration. The SStime of the V\nTT output no longer depends on the OCL\nsetting, but it is a function of the SS time of the V DDQ\nmemory supply rail. P GOOD  is asserted 2 ms after V TT is\nwithin ±20% of V RO. During tracking shutdown, V TT falls\nfollowing V RO until V RO reaches 360 mV . Once V RO falls\nbelow 360 mV , the internal discharge MOSFETs are turned\non and quickly discharge both V RO and V TT to GND.\nPGOOD  is de−asserted once V TT is beyond the ±20% range\nof V RO.\nNCP51400, NCV51400\nwww. onsemi.com\n7PACKAGE DIMENSIONSÇÇÇÇÇÇÇÇÇDFN10, 3x3, 0.5P\nCASE 506CL\nISSUE O\n10XSEATING\nPLANE\nLD\nE\n0.10 C\nA\nA1\neD2\nE2\nb1 5\n10 6NOTES:\n1.
