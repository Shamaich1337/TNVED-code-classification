This is a stress rating only; functional operation o f the product at these \nor any other conditions above those indicated in th e \noperational section of this specification is not implied. Operation beyond the maximum operating conditions for \nextended periods may affect product reliability.  \nTHERMAL DATA  \nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in \ncombination. The ADP7118 can be damaged when the junction \ntemperature limits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature  \ndoes not guaran tee that T J is within the specified temperature \nlimits. In applications with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the maximum ambient temperature may \nhave to be derated.  \nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low  \nprinted circuit board  (PCB ) thermal resistance, the maximum \nambient temperature can exceed th e maximum limit as long as \nthe junction temperature is within specification limits. The \njunction temperature of the device is depende nt on the ambient \ntemperature, the power dissipation (P\nD) of the device, a nd the \njunction- to-ambient  thermal resistance of the package (θ JA).  \nMaximum T J is calculated from the T A and P D using the \nformula  \nTJ = TA + (P D × θJA) (1) θJA of the package is based on modeling and calculation using a \n4-layer board. The θ JA is highly dependent on the application \nand board layout. In applications where high maximum power dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design is \nrequired. The value of θ\nJA may vary, depending on PCB material, \nlayout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θ JA \nare based on a 4 -layer, 4  inches  × 3 in ches  circuit board. See \nJESD51- 7 and JESD51- 9 for detailed information on the board \nconstruction.  \nΨJB is the junction -to-board thermal characterization parameter \nwith units of °C/W. The ΨJB of the package is based on \nmodeling and calculation  using a 4 -layer board. The  JESD51- 12, \nGuidelines for Reporting and Using Electronic Package Thermal Information , states that thermal characterization parameters are \nnot the same as thermal resistances. Ψ\nJB measures the component \npower flowing t hrough mult iple thermal paths rather t han a \nsingle  path as in thermal resistance ( θJB). Therefore, ΨJB thermal \npaths include convection from the top of the package as well as radiation from the package, factors that make Ψ\nJB more useful \nin real -world applications. Maximum T J is calculated from  the \nboard temperature (T B) and P D using the formula  \nTJ = TB + (P D × ΨJB) (2) \nSee JESD51 -8 and JESD51 -12 for more detailed information \nabout ΨJB. \nTHERMAL RESISTANCE  \nθJA, θJC, and Ψ JB are specified for the worst -case conditions, that \nis, a device soldered in a circuit board for surface -mount packages.  \nTable 4.

F | Page 13 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nThe ADP7118 is a low quiescent cu rrent, LDO  linear regulat or \nthat operates from 2 .7 V to 20 V  and provide s up to 2 00 mA  of \noutput current. Drawing a low 180 μA of quiescent current \n(typical) at full load makes the ADP7118 ideal for portable \nequipment. Typical  shutdo wn current consumption is less than \n3 µA at roo m temperature.  \nOptimized for use wi th small 2.2 µF ceramic capacitors, the \nADP7118 provides excellent transient performance.  \nVOUT\nSENSE/\nADJ\nGNDSHORT-CIRCUIT,\nTHERMAL\nPROTECTION\nREFERENCE\nSHUTDOWN ENVIN\n11849-040 \nFigure 42. Internal Block Diagram  \nInternally, the ADP7118 consists of a reference, an error \namplifier, and a PMOS pass transistor. Ou tput current is \ndelivered via the PMOS pass device, which is contro lled by the \nerror amplifier. The error a mplifier compares the refere nce \nvoltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies \nthe difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the \nreference voltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower , \nallowing more current to pass and incr easing the output \nvoltage. I f the feedback voltage is higher than the reference \nvoltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing \nless current to pass and decreasing the output voltage.  \n \n The ADP7118 is available in 16 fixed output voltage options, \nranging from 1. 2 V to 5 .0 V. The ADP7118 architecture allows \nany fixed output voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an  \nexternal voltage divider.  For example, a fixed 5  V output  can be \nset to a 6  V output  according to the fol lowing equation:  \nVOUT = 5 V(1 + R1/R2) (3) \nwhere R1 and R2 are the resistors in the output voltage divider \nshown in Figure 43. \nTo set the output voltag e of the adjustable ADP7118, replace \n5 V in Equation 3 with 1.2  V. \nVOUT\nSENSE/ADJVINADP7118\nGNDSSCSS\n1nFCIN\n2.2µFCOUT\n2.2µF\nEN\nOFFONVIN = 7V VOUT = 6V\nR1\n2kΩ\nR210kΩ\n11849-041 \nFigure 43. Typical Adjustable Output Voltage Application Schematic   \nIt is recommended that t he R2 value be less than 200 kΩ to \nminimize  errors in  the output voltage caused by the SENSE/ ADJ \npin input current. For example, wh en R1 and R2 each equal \n200 kΩ and the default output voltage is 1.2  V, the adjusted  output \nvoltage is 2.4  V. The output voltage er ror introduced by the \nSENSE/ ADJ pin input current is 1 mV or 0.0 4%, assuming a \ntypical SENSE/ ADJ pin input current of 10 nA at 25°C.  \nThe ADP7118 uses the EN pin to enable and disable the \nVOU T pin under normal operating conditions. When EN is \nhigh, VOUT turns on, and when EN is low, VOUT turns off. \nFor automatic startup, EN can be tied to VIN.  \n \nADP7118  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

The ESR of the output capacitor affects the stability \nof the LDO control loop. A minimum of 2.2 µF capacitance with \nan ESR of 0.3  Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability of \nthe ADP7118 . Transient respons e to changes in load current is \nalso affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value  of output \ncapacitanc e improves the transient response of the ADP7118 to \nlarge changes in load current.

Output Transient Response,  VOUT = 5 V, COUT = 2.2 µF, CH1 Load \nCurrent, CH2 V OUT \nInput Bypass Capacitor  \nConnecting a 2.2 µF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the circuit sensitivity to the PCB  layout, es pecially when long input \ntraces or high source impedance is  encountered. If greater than \n2.2 µF of output capacitance is required,  increase the input \ncapacitor to match it.  \nInput and Output Capacitor Properties  \nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be us ed with the \nADP7118, as long as they meet the minimum capacitance an d \nmaximum E SR requirements. Ceramic capacit ors are manufactured  with a variety of dielectrics, each with different behavior o ver \ntemperature and applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric  \nadequate to ensure the minimum capacitance over the necessar y \ntemperature range and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R  dielectrics \nwith a voltage rating of 6.3 V to 100  V are recommended. Y5V \nand Z5U dielectrics are not recommended, due to their poor temperature and dc bias characteristics.  \nFigure 45 depicts the capacitance vs. voltage bias characteristic \nof an 0 805, 2.2 µF, 10 V, X5R capacitor. The voltage stabili ty of \na capacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage rating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or \nhigher voltage rating exhibits better stability. The temperature \nvaria tion of the X5 R dielectric is ~ ±15% over the −40°C to \n+85°C temperature range and is not a function of package or \nvoltage rating.

The tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed \nto be 10%, and C BIAS is 2.09 μF at 5  V, as shown in Figure 45. \nThese  values in Equation 1 yie ld \nCEFF = 2.09 μF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 1.59 μF (5) \nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this examp le meets the \nminimum capacitance requirement of the LDO over  temper -\nature and tolerance at the chosen output voltage.  \nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP7118, it is imperative \nthat the effec ts of dc bias, temperature, and toleran ces on the \nbehavior of the capac itors be evaluated for each application.  \nData Sheet ADP7118  \n \nRev.

F | Page 16 of 24 NOISE R EDUCTION OF THE ADP7118 IN \nADJUSTABLE  MODE  \nThe ultralow output noise of the ADP7118  is achieved by keeping  \nthe LDO error amplifier in unity gain and setting the reference \nvoltage equal to the output voltage. This architecture does  not \nwork for an adjustable output voltage LDO  in the conventional \nsense. However, the ADP7118 architecture allows any fixed \noutput voltage to be set to a higher voltage with an external \nvoltag e divider. For example, a fixed 5  V output can be set to a \n10 V output according to Equati on 3  (see Figure 50): \nVOUT = 5 V(1 + R1/R2)  \nThe disadvantage in using the ADP7118 in this manner i s that \nthe output voltage noise is proportional to the output voltage.  \nTherefore, it is best to choose a fixed output voltage that is close \nto the target voltage to minimiz e the increase in output noise.  \nThe adjustable  LDO circuit can  be modified to reduce the \noutput voltage noise to levels close to that of the fixed output \nADP7118. The circuit shown in Figure 50 adds two additional  \ncomponents to the output voltage setting resistor divider.  CNR \nand R NR are added in parallel with R 1 to reduce the ac gain of \nthe error amplifier.  RNR is chosen to be small with respect to R2 . \nIf R NR is 1% to 10 % of the valu e of R2 , the minimum ac gain of  \nthe error amplifier is  approximately 0.1 dB to 0. 8 dB. The actual \ngain is determined by the parallel combination of R NR and R 1. \nThis gain ensures that the error amplifier always operates at \nslightly greater than unity gain.  \nCNR is chosen by setting the reactance of C NR equal to R1 − RNR \nat a frequency between 1  Hz and 50 Hz. This setting places the \nfrequency where the ac gain of the error amp lifier is 3  dB down \nfrom  the dc gain.  \nVOUT = 10V VIN = 12V VOUT VIN\nGNDSENSE/ADJ\nEN\n100k Ω200k ΩCOUT\n2.2µFCIN\n2.2µF\nON\nOFFRNR\n10kΩR2\n100k Ω+ + R1\n100k Ω CNR\n1µF+\n11849-048 \nFigure 50. Noise Reductio n Modification  \nThe noise of the adjustable LDO is fou nd by using the \nfollowing formula, assuming the noise of a fixed output  LDO is \napproximately 1 1 μV. \nNoise  = 11 μV × ( RPAR + R2)/R2 (9) \nwhere RPAR is a parallel combination of R1  and RNR. \nBased on the component values shown in Figure 50, the ADP7118 \nhas the following characteristics:  \n• DC gain of 10 (20 dB)  \n• 3 dB roll -off frequency of 1.75 Hz  \n• High frequency ac  gain of 1.099 (0.82 dB)  \n• Theoretical noise reduct ion factor of 9.1 (19.2 dB)  • Measured rms noise of the adjustable LDO without noise reduction is 70 µV rms  \n• Measured rms noise of the adjustable LDO with noise reduction is 12 µV rms  \n• Measure d noise reduction of approximately  15.3 dB \nNote that the measured no ise reduction is less than the theoretical  \nnoise reduction. Figure 51 shows the noise spectral density of an \nadjustable ADP7118 set to 6  V and 12  V wit h and without the \nnoise reduction network. T he output noise with the noise \nreduction network is approximately  the same for both voltages, \nespecially beyond 100 Hz. The noise of the 6 V and 12  V outputs \nwithout the noise reduction network differ s by a facto r of 2 up to \napproximately  20 kH z. Above 40 kHz, the closed loop gain of \nthe error amplifier is limited by  the open loop gain characteristic.  \nTherefore, the noise contribution from 20 kHz to 100 kHz is \nless than what it  is if the error amplifier had infini te bandwidth. \nThis is also the reason why the noise is less than what might be \nexpected simply based on the dc gain, that is , 70 µ V rms vs. \n110 µV rms.

T o approximate t he start -up time \nfor an adjustable model with a noise reduction network usin g the \nfollowing equation:  \nSSNR\nTIME (sec) = 5.5 × C NR × (R NR + RFB1) \nFor a C NR, RNR, and R1 combination of 1 µF, 10 kΩ, and 1 00 kΩ, \nas shown in  Figure 50, the start- up time is  approximately 0.6  sec. \nWhen SSNR TIME is greater than SSTIME, SSNR TIME dictates the \nlength of the s tart- up time instead of the soft start capacitor.  \nData Sheet ADP7118  \n \nRev. F | Page 17 of 24 CURRENT -LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD \nPROTECTION \nThe ADP7118 is protected against dam age due to excessive \npower dissipation by current and thermal  overload protection \ncircuits. The ADP7118 is designed to current limit when the \noutput load reaches 360 mA (typical). When the outpu t load \nexceeds 360 mA, the output voltage is reduced to main tain a \nconstant current limit.  \nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the \njunction temperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under \nextreme conditions (that is, high ambient tempe rature and/or \nhigh power dissipation) when the junction temp erature starts \nto rise above 150°C, the output is turned off, reducing the \noutput current to zero. When the junction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on again, and output curren t \nis restored to the  operating value.  \nConsider the case wher e a hard short from VOUT to ground \noccurs. At first, the ADP7118 current limits, so that only 360 mA \nis co nducted into the short. If self heating of the junction is \ngreat enough to cause  the temperature to rise above 150°C, \nthermal s hutdown activates, turning off the output and reducing \nthe output current to zero. As the junction temperature cools and drops be low 135°C, the output turns on and conducts \n360 mA into the short, again causing the ju nction \ntemperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal oscillation between 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation between 360 mA and 0 mA that continues as long as t he short \nremains at the outpu t. \nCurrent and thermal limit protections protect the devic e \nagainst accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation, device power dissipation must be externally limited so that the \njunction temperature does not exceed 12 5°C.  \nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS  \nIn applications with a low input -to-output voltage differen tial, \nthe ADP7118 does not dissipate much heat. However, in \napplications  with high ambient temperature and/or high input \nvoltage, the heat dissipated in the package may become large \nenough to cause  the junction temperature of the die to exceed \nthe maximum junction temperature of 125°C.  \nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter \nenters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction \ntemper ature has decreased below 135°C to prevent any permanent \ndamage. Therefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is \nvery important to guarantee reliable performance over all conditio ns. The junction temperature of the die is the sum of \nthe ambient temperature of the environment and t he tempera ture \nrise of the package due to the power dissipation, as shown in \nEquation 2.  \nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the ADP7118 must not exceed 125°C. To ensur e that the \njunction temperature stays below this maximum value, the user \nmust be aware of the parameters that contribute to junction temperature changes. T hese parameters include ambient \ntemperature, power dissipation in the power device, and thermal resis tances between the junction and ambient air (θ\nJA). \nThe θ JA number is dependent on the package assembly \ncompounds that are used and the  amount of copper use d to \nsolder the package GND pins to the PCB.  \nTable 6 shows typical θ JA values of the 8 -lead SOIC, 6 -lead LFCSP,  \nand 5 -lead TSOT packages for various PCB copper sizes. Table 7 \nshows the typical Ψ JB values of the 8 -lead SOIC, 6 -lead LFCSP, \nand 5 -lead TSOT.  \nTable 6.

Typical Ψ JB Values  \nModel  ΨJB (°C/W) \n6-Lead LFCSP  24 \n8-Lead SOIC  38.8 \n5-Lead TSOT  43 \n \nTo calculate t he junction temperature of the ADP7 118, use \nEquation 1.  \nTJ = TA + (P D × θJA)  \nwhere:  \nTA is the ambient temperature.  \nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by  \nPD = [(V IN − VOUT) × I LOAD] + (V IN × IGND) (10) \nwhere:  \nVIN and VOUT are input and output voltages, respectively.  \nILOAD is the  load current.  \nIGND is the ground current.  \nPower dissipation due to ground current is quite small and can be ignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to the following:  \nT\nJ = TA + {[( VIN − VOUT) × I LOAD] × θJA} (11) \nAs shown in Equati on 4, for a given  ambient temperature , input -\nto-output voltage differential , and continuous load current, \nthere exists a minimum copper size requirement  for the PCB \nto ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C. \nFigure 52 to Figure 60 show junction temperature calculations \nfor different ambient temperatures, power dissipation, and areas of PCB copper.  \nADP7118  Data Sheet \n \nRev.

However, as listed in  Table 6, a point of diminishing returns is \neventually reached, beyond which an increase in the copper size \ndoes not yield significant heat dissipation benefits.  Place the input capacitor as close as possible to the VI N and \nGND pins. Place the output capacitor as close as possible to the \nVOUT and GND pins.
