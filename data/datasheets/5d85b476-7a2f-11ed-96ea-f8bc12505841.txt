These products are\nbased on Skyworks Solutions proprietary RF isolation technology and offer\nshorter propagation delays, lower po wer consumption, smaller installed\nsize, and more stable operation with temperature and age versus optocouplers or other digital isolators.All devices in this family include hot-swap, bidirectional SDA and SCLisolation channels with open -drain, 35 mA sink capa bility and operate to a\nmaximum frequency of 1.7 MHz. The 8-pin version (Si8400/01) supports\nbidirectional SDA and SCL isolation; the Si8402 supports bidirectional SDA\nand unidirectional SCL isolation, and the 16-pin version (Si8405) features\ntwo unidirectional isolation channels to support additional system signals,such as an interrupt or reset. All versions contain protection circuits toguard against data errors if an unpowered device is inserted into a poweredsystem.Small size, low installed cost, lo w power consumption, and short\npropagation delays make the Si840x family the optimum solution forisolating I\n2C and SMBus serial ports.\nSafety Regulatory Approval\uf06eIndependent, bidirectional SDA and \nSCL isolation channels\n\uf06c\uf020Open drain outputs with 35 mA \nsink current\n\uf06c\uf020Supports I2C clocks up to 1.7 MHz\n\uf06eUnidirectional isolation channels \nsupport additional system signals \n(Si8405)\n\uf06eUp to 2500 VRMS isolation\n\uf06eUL, CSA, VDE recognition\uf06e60-year life at rated working voltage\n\uf06eHigh electromagnetic immunity\n\uf06eWide operating supply voltage\n\uf06c\uf0203.0 to 5.5 V\n\uf06eWide temperature range\n\uf06c\uf020–40 to +125 °C max\n\uf06eTransient immunity 25 kV/µs\n\uf06eRoHS-compliant packages\n\uf06c\uf020SOIC-8 narrow body\n\uf06c\uf020SOIC-16 narrow body\n\uf06eIsolated I2C, SMBus\n\uf06eIsolated digital power supply \ncommunications\n\uf06ePower over Ethernet\uf06eMotor Control Systems\n\uf06eHot-swap applications\n\uf06eIntelligent Power systems\n\uf06eUL 1577 recognized\n\uf06c\uf020Up to 2500 VRMS for 1 minute\n\uf06eCSA component notice 5A approval\n\uf06c\uf020IEC 60950-1, 61010-1 \n(reinforced insulation )\uf06eVDE certification conformity\n\uf06c\uf020IEC 60747-5-2 \n(VDE0884 Part 2)Ordering Information:\nSee page 25.\nNot Recommended \nfor New Designs\nSi840x\n2 Skyworks Solutions, Inc. • Phone [781] 376-3000 • Fax [781] 376-3100 • sales@skyworksinc .com • www.skyworksinc.com\nRev. 1.6 • Skyworks Proprietary Information • Products and Produc t Information are Subject to Change Without Notice • August 11 , 2021\nNot Recommended \nfor New Designs\nSi840x\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. • Phone [781] 376-3000 • Fax [781] 376-3100 • sales@skyworksinc.c om • www.skyworksinc.com 3\nRev. 1.6 • Skyworks Proprietary Information • Products and Produc t Information are Subject to Change Without Notice • August 11 , 2021TABLE  OF CONTENTS\nSection Page\n1.

Functional Description\n2.1.  Theory of Operation\nThe operation of an Si84xx channel is analogous to that of  an opto coupler, except an RF carrier is modulated\ninstead of light. This simple architecture provides a robust isolated data path and requires no special\nconsiderations or initializat ion at start-up. A simplified block diagram fo r a single unidirectional Si84xx channel is\nshown in Figure 5.\nFigure 5. Simplified Channel Diagram\nA channel consists of an RF Transmit ter and RF Receiver separated by a semiconductor-based isolation barrier.\nReferring to the Transmitter, input A modulates the carrier prov ided by an RF oscillator using on/off keying. The\nReceiver contains a demodulator that decodes the input state according to its RF energy content and applies the\nresult to output B via the output driver. This RF on/off keying scheme is superior to pulse code schemes as itprovides best-in-class noise immunity, low power consum ption, and better immunity  to magnetic fields.

Device Operation\nDevice behavior during start-up, normal operation, and shutdown is shown in Figure 7, where UVLO+ and UVLO–\nare the positive-going and negative-going thresholds re spectively. Refer to Table 1 2 to determine outputs when\npower supply (VDD) is not present.\n3.1.  Device Startup\nOutputs are held low during powerup until VDD is above the UVLO threshold for time period tSTART. Followingthis, the outputs follow the states of inputs.\n3.2.  Under Voltage Lockout\nUnder Voltage Lockout (UVLO) is prov ided to prevent erroneous operation during device startup and shutdown or\nwhen VDD is below its specified operating circuits ra nge. Both Side A and Side B each have their own under\nvoltage lockout monitors. Each side can enter or exit UVLO independently. For example, Side A unconditionally\nenters UVLO when AVDD falls below AVDDUVLO–  and exits UVLO when AVDD rises above AVDDUVLO+ . Side B\noperates the same as Side A with respect to its BVDD supply.\nFigure 7.

Layout Recommendations\nTo ensure safety in the end user application, high voltage circuits (i.e., circuits with >30 VAC) must be physically\nseparated from the safety extra-low volt age circuits (SELV is a circuit with <30 VAC) by a certain distance\n(creepage/clearance). If a component, such as a digital isolat or, straddles this isolation ba rrier, it must meet those\ncreepage/clearance requirements and also provide a suff iciently large high-voltage breakdown protection rating\n(commonly referred to as working voltage protection). Table 6 on page 9 and Table 7 on page 9 detail the working\nvoltage and creepage/c learance capabilities of the Si84xx. These tables al so detail the component standards\n(UL1577, IEC60747, CSA 5A), which are readily accepted by certification bodies to provide proof for end-system\nspecifications requirements. Refer to the end-system s pecification (61010-1, 60950- 1, etc.) requirements before\nstarting any design that uses a digital isolator.\nThe following sections detail the recommended bypass and decoupling components necessary to ensure robust\noverall performance and relia bility for systems using the Si84xx digital isolators. \n3.3.1. Supply Bypass\nDigital integrated circuit components typically require 0.1 µF (100 nF) bypass capacitors when used in electrically\nquiet environments. However, digital isolators are commo nly used in hazardous environments with excessively\nnoisy power supplies. To counteract these harsh condit ions, it is recommended that  an additional 1 µF bypass\ncapacitor be added between VDD and GND on both sides of the package. The capaci tors should be placed as\nclose as possible to the package to minimize stray i nductance. If the system is excessively noisy, it is\nrecommended that the designer add 50 to 100 \uf057 resistors in series with the VDD supply voltage source and 50 to\n300\uf057 resistors in series with the digital inputs/outputs (s ee Figure 8). For more details, see "5.Errata and Design\nMigration Guidelines" on page 22.All components upstream or downstream of the isolator should be properly decoupled as well. If these components\nare not properly decoupled, their supply noise can couple to the isolator inputs and outputs, potentially causing\ndamage if spikes exceed the maximum ratings of th e isolator (6 V). In this case, the 50 to 300 \uf057 resistors protect\nthe isolator\'s inputs/outputs (note t hat permanent device damage may occur if the absolute maximum ratings are\nexceeded). Functional operation should  be restricted to the conditions specified in Table 3, “Si8400/01/02/05\nElectrical Characteristics fo r Bidirectional I2C Channels\n1,” on page 5. and Table 4, “E lectrical Characteristics for\nUnidirectional Non-I2C Digital Channels (Si8402/05),” on page 7\n3.3.2. Pin ConnectionsNo connect pins are not internally connecte d. They can be left floating, tied to \nVDD, or tied to GND.\n3.3.3. Output Pin TerminationThe nominal output impedance of an non-I\n2C isolator driver channel is approximately 85 \uf057, ±40%, which is a\ncombination of the value of the on-chip series termination resistor and channel resistance  of the output driver FET.\nWhen driving loads where transmission line effects will be a factor, output pins should be appropriately terminated\nwith controlled impedance PCB traces. The series terminatio n resistor values should be scaled appropriately while\nkeeping in mind the recommendations described in “3 .3.1. Supply Bypass” above.\nFigure 8.

Typical Application Overview\n4.1.  I2C Background\nIn many applications, I2C, SMBus, and other digital power supply communications, including those for bus power\nmanagement, the interfaces require galvanic isolation for safety or ground loop elimination. For example, Power\nover Ethernet (PoE) applications typically use an I2C interface for communication between the PoE power sourcing\ndevice (PSE), and the earth ground referenced system cont roller. Galvanic isolation is required both by standard\nand also as a practical matter to prevent ground loops in Ethernet connected equipment.\nThe physical interface consists of tw o wires: serial data (SDA) and serial clock (SCL). These wires are connected\nto open collector drivers that serve as both inputs and outputs. At first glance, it appears that SDA and SCL can be\nisolated simply by placing two unidirectional isolator s in parallel, and in opposite directions. However, this\ntechnique creates feedback that latches the bus line low when  a logic low asserted by either master or slave. This\nproblem can be remedied by adding anti-latch circuits, bu t results in a larger and more expensive solution. The\nSi840x products offer a single-chip, anti-latch solution to the problem of isolating I2C/SMBus applications and\nrequire no external components except the I2C/SMBus pull-up resistors. In addition, they provide isolation to a\nmaximum of 2.5 kVRMS, support I2C clock stretching, and operate to a maximum I2C bus speed of 1.7 Mbps.\n4.2.  I2C Isolator Operation\nWithout anti-latch protection, bidirectional I2C isolators latch when an isolator  output logic low propagates back\nthrough an adjacent isolator channel creating a stable la tched low condition on both si des. Anti-latch protection is\ntypically added to one side of the is olator to avoid this condition (the “A” side for the Si8400/01/02/05).\nThe following examples illustrate typical circui t configurations using the Si8400/01/02/05.\nFigure 15. Isolated Bus Overview (Bidirectional Channels)\nThe “A side” output low (VOL) and input low (VIL) levels are designed such that the isolator VOL is greater than the\nisolator VIL to prevent the latch condition.I2C/SMBus\nUnit 1Si8400/01/02/05\nI2C/SMBus\nUnit 2ISO1\nISO2VOLVIL+\n-\nVOLVIL\nA Side\nB Side\nNot Recommended \nfor New Designs\nSi840x\nSkyworks Solutions, Inc. • Phone [781] 376-3000 • Fax [781] 376-3100 • sales@skyworksinc.c om • www.skyworksinc.com 19\nRev. 1.6 • Skyworks Proprietary Information • Products and Produc t Information are Subject to Change Without Notice • August 11 , 20214.3.  I2C Isolator Design Constraints\nTable 13 lists the design constraints.\n4.4.  I2C Isolator Design Considerations\nThe first step in applying an I2C isolator is to choose which side of the bus  will be connected to the isolator A side.\nIdeally, it should be the side which:\n1. Is compatible with the range of bus pull up specifi ed by the manufacturer. For ex ample, the Si8400/01/02/05 \nisolators are normally used with a pull up of 0.5 mA to 3 mA.\n2. Has the highest input low level for devices on the bu s. Some devices may specif y an input low of 0.9 V and \nother devices might require an input low of 0.3 x Vdd.  Assuming a 3.3 V minimum power supply, the side with \nan input low of 0.3 x Vdd is the better side bec ause this side has an input low level of 1.0 V.\n3. Have devices on the bus that can pull down below the is olator input low level. For example, the Si840x input \nlevel is 0.45 V. As most CMOS devices can pull to within 0.4 V of GND this is generally not an issue.\n4. Has the lowest noise. Due to the special logi c levels, noise margins can be as low as 50 mV.\nThe Si840x isolators are not compatible with devices that ha ve a logic low of 0.8 V. For this situation, a discrete\ncircuit can be used. See “AN352: Low-Cost, High-Speed I2C Isolation with Digital Isolators” for additional\ninformation.Table 13. Design Constraints\nDesign Constraint Data Sheet ValuesEffect of Bus Pull-up Strength\nand Temperature\nTo prevent the latch condition, the \nisolator output low level must be greater than the isolator input low level.Isolator V\nOL 0.8 V typical\nIsolator VIL 0.6 V typical\nInput/Output Logic Low Level\nDifference \nΔVSDA1, ΔVSCL1 = 50 mV minimumThis is normally guaranteed by the isolator data sheet. However, if the pull up strength is too weak, the out-put low voltage will fall and can get too close to the input low logic level. These track over temperature.\nThe bus output low must be less than the isolator input low logic level.Bus V\nOL=0 . 4V  m a x i m u m\nIsolator VIL= 0.45 V minimumIf the pull up streng th is too large, \nthe devices on the bus might not pull the voltage below the input low range.
