It describes L86 module hardware interfaces \nand its external application reference circuits, mechanical size and air interface. \n \nThis document can help you quickly understand the interface specifications, electrical and mechanical \ndetails of L86 module. Other documents such as L86 software application notes and user guider are also \nprovided for you. These documents can ensure you use L86 module to design and set up applications \nquickly. \n \n \n \n \n  \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        8 / 43  \n \n \n 2 Description \n \n2.1. General Description \n \nL86 GNSS module with an embedded patch antenna (18.4 mm ×  18.4mm ×  4mm) and LNA brings high \nperformance of MTK positioning engine to the industrial applications. It is able to achieve the industry’s \nhighest level of sensitivity, accuracy and TTFF with the lowest power consumption in a small-footprint \nlead-free package. The embedded flash memory provides capacity for users to store some useful \nnavigation data and allows for future updates.  \n \nL86 module combines with many advanced features including EASY, AIC, LOCUS, AlwaysLocateTM and \nAntenna Supervisor . These features are beneficial to accelerate TTFF, improve sensitivity, save \nconsumption and detect antenna status for GNSS system. The module supports various location, \nnavigation and industrial applications including autonomous GPS, GLONASS , SBAS (including WAAS, \nEGNOS, MSAS, and GAGAN), QZSS, and AGPS. \n \nL86 module simplifies the device’s design and cost because of embedded patch antenna and LNA. \nFurthermore, L86 module not only supports automatic antenna switching function, which can achieve \nswitching between external active antenna and internal patch antenna, but also supports external active \nantenna detection and short protection. The detection and notification of different external active antenna \nstatus will be shown in the NMEA message including external active antenna connection, open circuit for \nantenna and antenna short-circuit ed. So host can query the external active antenna status timely and \nconveniently.  \n \nEASY technology as the key feature of L86 module is one kind of AGPS. Collecting and processing all \ninternal aiding information like GPS time, Ephemeris, Last Position etc., the GNSS module will have a fast \nTTFF in either Hot or Warm start. \n \nL86 module is a SMD type module with the compact 18.4mm ×  18.4mm ×  6.45mm form factor, which can \nbe embedded in your applications through the 12-pin pads with 2.54mm pitch. It provides necessary \nhardware interfaces between the module and main board.  \n \nThe module is fully ROHS compliant to EU regulation. \n \n \n \n \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        9 / 43  \n \n \n 2.2.

Refer to chapter \n4.3. \n \n3.3. Power Supply \n \nVCC pin supplies power for BB, RF, I/O, LNA, short protection and antenna detection circuit.  The load \ncurrent of VCC varies according to the VCC level, processor load, the number of tracked satellites and the \nrate of satellite re-acquisition . Using external active antenna will consume an additional current about \n10mA from our module. It is important to supply sufficient current and make the power clean and stable. \nThe decouple combination of 10uF and 100nF capacitor is recommended nearby VCC pin. \n \nThe V_BCKP pin supplies power for RTC domain. It should be valid when powering on the module. The \nvoltage of RTC domain ranges from 1.5V to 4.3V. In order to achieve a better TTFF, RTC domain should \nbe valid all the time. It can supply power for SRAM memory in RTC domain which contains all the \nnecessary GNSS information for quick start-up and a small amount of user configuration variables. \n \nThe module’s internal power construction is shown as below . \n \nVCC supplies power for PMU and V_BCKP supplies power for RTC domain. FORCE_ON signal \nhighlighted in red in the following figure belongs to RTC domain and can be used to control the switch \non/off. The following action will close and open the switch: \n \n\uf06c The switch will be closed by default when VCC & V_BCKP is supplied power. \n\uf06c Based on above step, FORCE_ON open or low and sending PMTK command can open the switch \n(full on    backup). \n\uf06c Based on above step, FORCE_ON logic high can close the switch (backup    full on). \n \nPMU VCC\nV_BCKP\nFORCE_ON\nRTCARM\nLogic \ncircuit\nRTC \npower\n \nFigure 3: Internal Power Construction \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        15 / 43  \n \n \n  \n1. VCC does not supply power for RTC domain in L86 module, so the V_BCKP pin must be powered \nexternally. Furthermore, it is strongly recommended to power V_BCKP through a backup battery, \nwhich can ensure L86 module supports EASY technology and improves TTFF after next restart.  \n2. Please choose one voltage source without built -in output high speed discharge function, and confirm \nthe voltage drop down curve to keep long output voltage drop down period. Meanwhile, make sure the \noutput voltage drop time is greater than 100ms (from 2.7V to 0.5V).  \n3. It’s strongly recommended to use external LDOs without output discharge function to keep long output \nvoltage dr op-down period.  \n4. Please refer to document [ 4] about  GNSS module power supply  for more details.  \n \n3.4.

Full On Mode \nFull on mode includes tracking mode and acquisition mode. Acquisition mode is defined as the module \nstarts to search satellites, determine visible satellites and coarse carrier frequency and code phase of \nsatellite signals. When the acquisition is completed, it switches to tracking mode automatically. Tracking \nmode is defined as the module keeps tracking satellites and demodulates the navigation data from the \nspecific satellites. \n \nWhen the combination of VCC and V_BCKP is valid, the module will enter into full on mode automatically \nand follow the default configurations as below. You can refer to chapter 3.3 about internal power \nconstruction to have a good comprehension. You can also use PMTK commands to change the \nconfigurations to satisfy your requirements.  \n \nTable 5: Default Configurations \nItem Configuration  Comment  \nBaud Rate 9600bps  \nProtocol  NMEA  RMC, VTG, GGA, GSA, GSV, GLL and \nGPTXT  (MTK proprietary protocol ) \nUpdate Rate 1Hz  \nSBAS  Enable   \nAIC Enable   \nLOCUS  Disable   \nEASY Enable  EASY will be disabled automatically when \nupdate rate exceeds 1Hz.  \nGNSS  GPS+GLONASS    \n \n3.4.2. Standby Mode \nStandby mode is a low-power mode. In standby mode, the internal core and I/O power domain are still \nactive, but RF and TCXO are powered off, the module stops satellites search and navigation. UART is still \naccessible like PMTK commands or any other data, but there is no NMEA messages output. \n \nSending PMTK command “$PMTK161,0*28” will make L86 module enter into standby mode. Sending any \ndata via UART can wake the module up. When the module exits from standby mode, it will use all internal \naiding information like GPS time, Ephemeris, Last Position , etc., resulting to a fastest possible TTFF in \neither Hot or Warm start. The typical standby current consumption in this way is about 1mA @VCC=3.3V. \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        17 / 43  \n \n \n  \nWhen the external active antenna is used, an additional  current about  10mA will be consumed because \nthe VCC still supply power for external active antenna in standby mode.  \n \n3.4.3. Backup Mode \nBackup mode is a lower power consumption mode than standby mode. In this mode, the module stops \nacquiring and tracking satellites. UART is not accessible. But the backed-up memory in RTC domain \nwhich contains all the necessary GNSS information for quick start-up and a small amount of user \nconfiguration variables is alive. Due to the backed-up memory, EASY technology is available. The typical \nconsumption in this mode can be as low as 7uA. \n \nThere are two ways to enter into backup mode and back to full on mode: \n \n\uf06c Sending command: “$PMTK225,4*2F” (the red line open s the switch in Figure 3) to enter into backup \nmode forever. The only way to wake up the module is pulling the FORCE_ON high (the red line \ncloses the switch in Figure 3).  \n\uf06c Cutting off VCC and keeping V_BCKP is alive will make the module enter into backup mode from full \non mode. As long as the VCC pin is supplied power, the module will back to full on mode immediately. \nBut this method is not recommended. \n \n  \nKeep FORCE_ON pin open or low before entering into backup mode , or it is not available.  \n \nThe V_BCKP pin can be directly supplied by an external capacitor or battery (rechargeable or \nnon-chargeable). Please refer to the following figure for RTC backup reference design. \n \nRTC LDOMODULE\nV_BCKP\nNon-chargeable\nBackup Battery\n100nF 4.7uF\n \nFigure 4 : RTC Supply from N on-chargeable Battery \n NOTE  \nNOTE  \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        18 / 43  \n \n \n The V_BCKP pin does not support charging function for rechargeable battery.

Periodic Mode \nPeriodic mode is a power saving mode of L86 module that can control the full on mode and \nstandby/backup mode periodically to reduce power consumption. It contains periodic standby mode and \nperiodic backup mode. \n \nThe format of the command which enters into periodic mode is as follows: \n \nTable 6: PMTK Command Format \nFormat:  \n$PMTK225,<Type>,<Run_time>,<Sleep_time>,<2nd_run_time>,<2nd _sleep_time>*<checksum><\nCR><LF>  \nParameter  Format  Description  \nType  Decimal Type=1  for Periodic Backup Mode  \nType=2  for Periodic Standby Mode  \nRun_time  Decimal Full on period (ms)  \nSleep_time  Decimal Standby/Backup period (ms)  \n2nd_run_time  Decimal Full on period (ms) for extended acquisition in case  \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        19 / 43  \n \n \n module acquisition fails during the Run_time \n2nd_sleep_time  Decimal Standby/Backup period (ms) for extended sleep in case  \nmodule acquisition fails during the Run_time \nChecksum  Hexadecimal  Hexadecimal checksu m \n \nExample: \n$PMTK225,1,3000,12000,18000,72000*16<CR><LF> \n$PMTK225,2,3000,12000,18000,72000*15<CR><LF> \n \nSending “$PMTK225,0*2B” in any time will make the module enter into full on mode from periodic standby \nmode. \n \nPulling the FORCE_ON high and sending “$PMTK225,0*2B” immediately will make the module enter into \nfull on mode from periodic backup mode. \n \nSending “$PMTK225,0*2B” in Run_time or 2nd_run_time  will also make the module enter into full on \nmode from periodic backup mode, but it is hard to operate and not recommended.  \n \n \nBefore entering into periodic backup mode, please ensure FORCE_ON pin is open or  low and power \nsupply for V_BCKP is alive.  \n \nThe following figure has shown the operation of period ic mode. When you send PMTK command, the \nmodule will be in the full on mode firstly. After several minutes, the module will enter into the period ic \nmode and follow the parameters set by you. When the module fails to fix the position in run time, the \nmodule will switch to 2nd_run_time and 2nd_sleep_time  automatically. As long as the module fixes the \nposition again, the module will return to Run_time  and Sleep_time.  \n \nPlease ensure the module is in the tracking state before entering into periodic mode. Otherwise, the \nmodule will have a risk of failure to track the satellites. If GNSS module is located in weak signal \nenvironment, it is better to set the longer 2nd_run_time  to ensure the success of re-acquisition.  \n \nThe average current value can be calculated by the following formula: \n \nI periodic = (I  tracking ×  T1+I standby/backup ×  T2)/ (T1+T2)   T1: Run_time, T2: Sleep_time  \n \nExample: \nPMTK225,2,3000,12000,18000,72000*15 for periodic mode with 3s in tracking mode and 12s in standby \nmode based on GPS&GLONASS. The average current consumption is calculated as below: \nI periodic = (I tracking × T1+I standby × T2 )/(T1+T2)=(26 mA× 3s + 1mA× 12s)/(3s+12s)=6  (mA) \n NOTE  \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        20 / 43  \n \n \n PMTK225,1,3000,12000,18000,72000*16 for periodic mode with 3s in tracking mode and 12s in backup \nmode based on GPS&GLONASS. The average current consumption is calculated as below: \nI periodic = (I tracking × T1+I backup × T2)/ (T1+T2)=(26 mA× 3s + 0.007mA× 12s)/(3s+12s)≈5.2(mA)  \nPower\nRun_timeRun_time\nSleep_timeSleep_time2nd_run_time\n2nd_sleep_timeRun_timeRun_time\nSleep_timeSleep_timeFull on 2nd_run_time\n2nd_sleep_time\n \nFigure 6: Periodic Mode \n \n3.4.5. AlwaysLocateTM Mode \nAlwaysLocateTM is an intelligent power saving mode. It contains AlwaysLocateTM backup mode and \nAlwaysLocateTM standby mode. \n \nAlwaysLocateTM standby mode supports the module to switch automatically between full on mode and \nstandby mode. According to the environmental and motion conditions, the module can adaptively adjust \nthe full on time and standby time to achieve a balance between positioning accuracy and power \nconsumption. Sending “$PMTK225,8*23” and the module returning: “$PMTK001,225,3*35” means the \nmodule accesses AlwaysLocateTM standby mode successfully. It will benefit power saving in this mode. \nSending “$PMTK225,0*2B” in any time will make the module back to full on mode.  \n \nAlwaysLocateTM backup mode is similar to AlwaysLocateTM standby mode. The difference is that \nAlwaysLocateTM backup mode can switch between full on mode and backup mode automatically. The \nPMTK command to enter into AlwaysLocateTM backup mode is “$PMTK225,9*22”.  Pulling FORCE_ON \nhigh and sending “$PMTK225,0*2B” immediately will make the module back to full on mode.  \n \nThe positioning accuracy in AlwaysLocateTM mode will be somewhat degraded, especially in high speed. \nThe following picture shows the rough power consumption of L86 module in different daily scenes when \nAlwaysLocateTM mode is enabled. \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        21 / 43  \n \n \n \n \nFigure 7: AlwaysLocateTM Mode \n \nExample : \nThe typical average consumption is about 4.0mA in AlwaysLocateTM standby mode and 3. 5mA in \nAlwaysLocateTM backup mode.  \n \n \n1. Power consumption is measured  in GPS&GLONASS system  under outdoor static mode with patch                   \nantenna. Using external active antenna will increase the power consumption.  \n2. Before entering into AlwaysLocateTM backup mode, please ensure FORCE_ON pin is open or  low \nand power s upply for V _BCKP is alive . \n \n3.5. Reset \n \nL86 module can be restarted by driving the RESET to a low level voltage for a certain time and then \nreleasing it. This operation will reset the digital part of the GNSS receiver. Note that Non-Volatile Backup \nRAM content is not cleared and thus fast TTFF is possible. An OC driver circuit shown as below is \nrecommended to control the RESET. \n \n4.7K\n47KRESET\nInput pulse\n \nFigure 8: Reference Reset Circuit Using OC Circuit NOTE S \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        22 / 43  \n \n \n The restart timing of L86 module has been illustrated bellow. \n \nVIL<0.8VVIH >2.0VPulldown\n > 10ms\nRESET\nUART Valid Valid Invalid InvalidVCC > 2ms\n \nFigure 9: Restart Timing \n3.6.

If the module’s UART por t is \nconnected to the UART port of a computer, it is necessary to add a level shift circuit between the module \nand the computer.

EASY Technology \n \nEASY technology works as embedded software which can accelerate TTFF by predicting satellite \nnavigation messages from received ephemeris. The GNSS engine will calculate and predict orbit \ninformation automatically up to 3 days after first receiving the broadcast ephemeris, and saving the \npredicted information into the internal memory. GNSS engine will use this information for positioning if no \nenough information from satellites, so the function will be helpful for positioning and TTFF improvement. \n \nThe EASY function can reduce TTFF to 5s for warm start. In this case, RTC domain should be valid. In \norder to g et enough broadcast ephemeris information from GPS satellites , the GNSS module should \nreceive the information for at least 5 minutes in a good signal condition after fixing the position.    \n \nEASY function is enabled by default. The command “$PMTK869,1,0*34” can be used to disable EASY. \nFor more details, please refer to the document [2]. \n \n3.8. Multi-tone AIC \n \nL86 module provides an advanced technology called multi-tone AIC (Active Interference Cancellation) to \nreject RF interference which comes from other active components on the main board. \n \nUp to 12 multi-tone AIC embedded in the module can provide effective narrow-band interference and \njamming elimination. The GNSS signal could be recovered from the jammed signal, which can ensure \nbetter navigation quality. AIC is enabled by default, closing it will save about 1mA @VCC=3.3V \nconsumption. The following commands can be used to set AIC. \n \nEnable AIC function: “$PMTK 286,1*23”.  \nDisable AIC function: “$PMTK 286,0*22”.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        25 / 43  \n \n \n 3.9. LOCUS \n \nL86 module supports the embedded logger function called LOCUS. It can log position information to the \ninternal flash memory automatically when this function is enabled by sending PMTK command \n“$PMTK185, 0*22”. Due to this function, the host can go to sleep to save power consumption and do not \nneed to receive the NMEA information all the time. The module can provide a log capacity of more than 16 \nhours.  \n \nThe detail procedures of this function are illustrated as bellow:  \n \n\uf06c The module has fixed the position (only 3D_fixed is available); \n\uf06c Sending PMTK command “$PMTK184,1*22” to erase internal flash ; \n\uf06c Sending PMTK command “$PMTK185,0*22” to start log ; \n\uf06c Module l ogs the basic information (UTC time, latitude, longitude and height) every 15 seconds to \ninternal flash memory; \n\uf06c Stop logging the information by sending “$PMTK185,1*23” ; \n\uf06c Host can get the data from the module via UART by sending“$PMTK622, 1*29”. \n \nThe raw data which host gets has to be parsed via LOCUS parser code provided by Quectel. For more \ndetails, please contact Quectel technical support. \n \n3.10. Antenna Supervisor \n \nAntenna Supervisor is designed to detect different external active antenna status including external active \nantenna connection, open circuit for antenna and antenna short-circuited, and then notify the module.

The LNA is embedded for better \nperformance. It is an ultra-compact module with embedded 18.4 ×  18.4 ×  4.0mm patch antenna, in \naddition, L86 module can also support external active antenna, and the RF signal is obtained from the \nEX_ANT pin. Both internal patch signal and external active antenna signal are intelligently switched \nthrough SPDT. \n \n4.1.

PCB Design Guide \nRadiation characteristics of antenna depend on various factors, such as the size and shape of the PCB, \nthe dielectric constant of components nearby. For the best performance, it is recommended to follow \nthese rules listed as below. \n \nKeep at least 10mm away from the nearest edge of the mother board. It is better for L86 module to be \nplaced in the center of the mother board. \n \nKeep enough distance between L86 module antenna and tall components, the height of which is more \nthan 6mm, and the minimum distance (d) is 10mm. \n \nPut L86 module on the top of the main PCB, which can guarantee antenna to face to open sky and \nachieve good receiving performance during operation. \n \nDevice enclosure should be made of non-metal materials especially around antenna area. The minimum \ndistance between antenna and enclosure is 1mm. \n \nIt is recommended that the mother board is bigger than 80mm× 40mm for the better performance. And \npour ground copper on the whole mother board. \n \nOther antennas such as BT\\WIFI\\GSM should be kept minimum 10mm distance far away from the \nembedded patch antenna in L86 module. \nMother board Integrated \nchips \nMetal \ncomponents Other \nantennadd\nd\nd\nd is supposed to be greater than 10mm and no metal cover used for this area.dL86-M33\nBT/WIFI/GSM\n \nFigure 14: L86 Module Placement Guide \n \n \n \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        29 / 43  \n \n \n 4.2.

Antenna Status Indicator \n \nL86 module supports automatic antenna switching function. The GPTXT sentence can be used to identify \nthe status of external active antenna. \n \nIf ANTSTATUS=OPEN , it means external active antenna is not connected or has poor contact with \nantenna feeding point and the internal antenna is used. \n \nIf ANTSTATUS=OK , it means external active antenna is connected and the module will use external \nactive antenna. \n \nIf ANTSTATUS=SHORT , it means active antenna is short circuited and the internal patch antenna will be \nused automatically. \n \n  \n \nBecause antenna short protection is enabled by default, L86 module  will switch to emb edded patch \nantenna automatically in case that external active antenna is short -circuited, which will avoid L86 module  \nfrom damage. Meanwhile, you need to check the external active antenna.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n NOTE  NOTE  \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        31 / 43  \n \n \n Example: \n“OPEN” is displayed in the GPTXT sentence  as below: \n \nFigure 16: Active Antenna Status Description in GPTXT \n \nTable 10: GPTXT - Status of Antenna \nGPTXT \nDisplay  Ext Active \nAntenna Status  Inner Patch \nAntenna Status  Attention  \nOPEN  Unused  Working You need to check the external active antenna \nstatus if the active antenna is used.   \nOK Working Unused  \nSHORT  Short  Working  Please check the external active antenna  \n \nThe pin “AADET_N” also can be used to indicate the status of active antenna.

Assembly and Soldering \n \nL86 module is intended for SMT assembly and soldering in a Pb-free reflow process on the top side of the \nPCB. It is suggested that the minimum height of solder paste stencil is 100um to ensure sufficient solder \nvolume. Pad openings of paste mask can be increased to ensure proper soldering and solder wetting over \npads. It is suggested that peak reflow temperature is 235~245º C (for SnAg3.0Cu0.5 alloy). Absolute max \nreflow temperature is 260º C. To avoid damage to the module when it is repeatedly heated, it is suggested \nthat the module should be mounted after the first panel has been reflowed. The following picture is the \nactual diagram which we have operated. \nTime(s)50 100 150 200 250 30050100150200250\n  \n160℃  \n200℃217\n070s~120s40s~60s\nBetween 1~3℃/SPreheat Heating Cooling℃\nsLiquids \nTemperature \n \nFigure 22: Ramp-soak-spike-reflow of Furnace Temperature \n \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        39 / 43  \n \n \n 7.2. Moisture Sensitivity \n \nL86 module is sensitivity to moisture absorption. To prevent L86 module from permanent damage during \nreflow soldering, baking before reflow is required in following cases:  \n \n\uf06c Humidity indicator card: At least one circular indicator is no longer blue.  \n\uf06c The seal is opened and the module is exposed to excessive humidity.  \n \nL86 module should be baked for 192 hours at temperature 40 °C+5°C/-0°C and <5% RH in \nlow-temperature containers, or 24 hours at temperature 125 °C±5°C in high-temperature containers. Care \nshould be taken that plastic t ape is not heat resistant. L86 module should be taken out before preheating, \notherwise, the tape maybe damaged by high-temperature heating. \n \n7.3. ESD Protection \n \nL86 module is an ESD sensitive device. ESD protection precautions should be emphasized. Proper ESD \nhanding and packaging procedures must be applied throughout the processing, handling and operation of \nany application. Please note the following measures are good for ESD protection when L 86 module is \nhandle d. \n \n\uf06c Unless there is a galvanic coupling between the local GND and the PCB GND, then the first point of \ncontact shall always be between the local GND and PCB GND when handling the PCB.  \n\uf06c Before mounting with the RF_IN pad, please make sure the GND of the module has been connected. \n\uf06c Do not contact any charged capacitors and materials which can easily develop or store charges \n(such as patch antenna, coax cable, soldering iron) when handling with the RF_IN pad. \n\uf06c To prevent electrostatic discharge from the RF input, please do not touch any exposed area of the \nmounted patch antenna. \n\uf06c Make sure to use an ESD safe soldering iron (tip) when soldering the RF_IN pin. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nQuectel \nConfidential\nGNSS Module Series \nL86 Hardware Design  \n \nL86_Hardware_Design                   Confidential / Released                        40 / 43  \n \n \n 7.4.
