GENERAL DESCRIPTION S \nThe W25N512G V (512M -bit) Serial SLC NAND  Flash Memory  provide s a storage solution for systems with \nlimited space, pins and power. The W25N SpiFlash  family incorporates the popular  SPI interface and the \ntraditional large NAND non -volatile memory space . They are ideal for code shadowing to RAM,  executing \ncode directly from D ual/Quad SPI  (XIP) and storing voice, text and data. The device operate s on a single \n2.7V to 3.6V power supply with current consumption as low as 25mA active , 10µA for standby  and 1 µA for \ndeep power down . All W25N SpiFlash family  devices are of fered in space -saving packages  which were \nimpossible to use in the past for the typical NAND flash memory . \nThe W25N512G V 512M -bit memory array is organized into 32,768  programmable pages of 2,048 -bytes \neach. The entire page can be programmed at one time using th e data from the 2,048 -Byte internal buffer . \nPages can be erased in groups of 64 (128KB block  erase). The W25N512G V has 512 erasable block s. \nThe W25N512G V support s the standard Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), Dual/Quad I/O  SPI: Serial Clock, \nChip Select, Serial Data I/O 0 (DI), I/O1 (DO), I/O2 (/WP), and I/O3 (/HOLD) . SPI clock frequencies of up to \n166MHz are supported allowing equivalent clock rates of 332MHz ( 166MHz x 2) for Dual I/O and 664MHz \n(166MHz x 4) for Quad I/O wh en us ing the Fast Read Dual/Quad I/O  instructions.  \nThe W25N512G V provides a new Continuous Read Mode that allows for efficient access to the entire \nmemory array with a single Read command . This feature is ideal for code shadowing applications.  \nA Hold pin, Write Protect pin and programmable write protect ion, provide  further control flexibility. \nAdditionally, the device supports JEDEC standard manufacturer and device ID, one 2,048 -Byte Unique ID \npage, one 2,048 -Byte parameter page and ten 2,048 -Byte OTP pages. To provide better NAND flash \nmemory manageability, user configurable internal ECC, bad block management are also available  in \nW25N512G V. \n2.

PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \n4.1 Chip Select (/CS)  \nThe SPI Chip Select (/CS) pin enables and disables device operation. When /CS  is high the device is \ndeselected and the Serial Data Output (DO, or IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3) pins are at high impedance. When \ndeselected, the devices power consumption will be at standby levels unless an internal erase, program or \nwrite status register cycle is in progress. When /CS  is brought low the device will be selected, power \nconsumptio n will increase to active levels and instructions can be written to and data read from the device. \nAfter power -up, /CS  must transition from high to low before a new instruction will be accepted. The /CS \ninput must track the VCC supply level at power -up and power -down  (see “Write Protection” and Figure \n33b). If needed , a pull -up resist or on the /CS pin can be used to accomplish this.  \n4.2 Serial Data Input, Output and IOs (DI, DO and IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3)   \nThe W25N512GV  supports standard SPI, Dual SPI and Quad SPI operation. Standard SPI instructions use \nthe unidirectional DI (input) pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising \nedge of the Serial Clock (CLK) input pin. Standard SPI also uses the unidirectional DO (output) to read  data \nor status from the device on the falling edge of CLK.  \nDual and Quad SPI instructions use the bidirectional IO pins to serially write instructions, addresses or data \nto the device on the rising edge of CLK and read data or status from the device on t he falling edge of CLK.  \n4.3 Write Protect (/WP)  \nThe Write Protect (/WP) pin can be used to prevent the Status Register from being written. Used in \nconjunction with the S tatus Register’s Block Protect bits BP[3:0]  and Status Register Protect SRP bits \nSRP[1:0],  a portion as small as one 128KB Block  or up to the entire memory array can be hardware \nprotected . The WP -E bit in the Protection Register (SR -1) controls the function s of the /WP pin.   \nWhen WP -E=0, the device is in the Software Protection mode that only SR-1 can be protected. The /WP  \npin functions as a  data I/O pin for the Quad SPI operations, as well as an active low input pin for the Write \nProtection funct ion for SR -1. Refer to section 7.1.3 for detail information.  \nWhen WP -E=1, the device is in the Hard ware Protection mode that /WP becomes a dedicated active low \ninput pin for the Write Protection of the entire device. If /WP is tied to GND, all “Write/Program/Erase” \nfunctions are disabled. The entire device (including all registers, memory array, OTP pag es) will become \nread-only. Quad SPI read operations are also disabled when WP -E is set to 1.   \n4.4 HOLD (/HOLD)  \nDuring Standard and Dual SPI operations, t he /HOLD pin allows the device to be paused while it is actively \nselected. When /HOLD is brought low, while  /CS is low, the DO pin will be at high impedance and signals \non the DI and CLK pins will be ignored (don’t care). When /HOLD is brought high, device operation can \nresume. The  /HOLD  function can be useful when multiple devices are sharing the same SPI sign als. The \n/HOLD pin is active low.  \nWhen a Quad SPI Read/Buffer Load command is issued, /HOLD pin will become a data I/O pin for the \nQuad operations and no HOLD function  is available until the current Quad operation finishes . /HOLD (IO3) \nmust be driven high by the host, or an external pull -up resistor must be placed on the PCB , in order to avoid \nallowing the /HOLD input to float.  \n4.5 Serial Clock (CLK)  \nThe SPI Serial Clock Input (CLK) pin provides the timing for serial input and output operations.

W25N512G V Flash Memory  Operation Diagram  \n \n6.1.1  Standard SPI Instructions  \nThe W25N512GV  is accessed through an SPI compatible bus consisting of four signals: Serial Clock (CLK), \nChip Select ( /CS), Serial Data Input  (DI) and Serial Data Output (DO). Standard SPI instructions use the DI \ninput pin to serially write instructions, addresses or data to the device on the rising edge of CLK . The  DO \noutput pin is used to read data or status from the device on the falling edge  of CLK.  \nSPI bus operation Mode 0 (0,0) and 3 (1,1) are supported. The primary difference between Mode 0 and \nMode 3 concerns the normal state of the CLK signal when the SPI bus master is in standby and data is not \nbeing transferred to the Serial Flash. For Mode 0 , the CLK signal is normally low  on the falling and rising \nedges of /CS.  For Mode 3 , the CLK signal is no rmally high  on the falling and rising edges of /CS .  \n6.1.2  Dual SPI Instructions  \nThe W25N512GV  support s Dual SPI operation when using instructions such as  “Fast Read Dual Output  \n(3Bh)”  and “Fast Read Dual I/O  (BBh) ”. These instructions  allow data to be transferred to or from the device  \nat two to three times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash devices.  The Dual SPI Read instruction s are ideal for \nquickly downloading code to RAM upon power -up (code -shadowing) or for execut ing non-speed -critical \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \n \n- 13 - \ncode directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Dual SPI instructions , the DI and DO pins become \nbidirectional I/ O pins:  IO0 and IO1.  \n6.1.3  Quad SPI Instructions  \nThe W25N512G V supports Quad  SPI operation whe n using instructions such as  “Fast Read Quad  Output  \n(6Bh /6Ch )”, “Fast Read  Quad  I/O (EBh /ECh )” and “Quad Program Data Load (32h/34h)” . These instructions \nallow data to be transferred to or from the device four to six times the rate of ordinary Serial Flash. The \nQuad Read instructions offer a signifi cant improvement in continuous  and random access transfer rates \nallowing fast code -shadowing to RAM or execution directly from the SPI bus (XIP) . When using Quad SPI \ninstructions the DI and DO pins become bidirectional IO0 and IO1 , and the /WP and /HOLD pins become \nIO2 and IO3 respectively . \n6.1.4  Hold Function  \nFor Standard SPI and Dual SPI operations, t he /HOLD  signal allows the W25N512G V operation to be \npaused while it is actively selected (when /CS is low). The  /HOLD  function may be useful in cases where \nthe SPI data and clock signals are shared with other devices. For example, consider if the page buffer was \nonly partially written when a priority interrupt requires use of the SPI bus. In this case the  /HOLD  function \ncan save the stat e of the instruction and the data in the buffer so programming can resume where it left off \nonce the bus is available again.  The /HOLD function is only available for standard SPI and Dual SPI \noperation, not during Quad SPI.  When a Quad SPI command is issue d, /HOLD pin will act as a dedicated \nIO pin (IO3) . \nTo initiate a  /HOLD  condition, the device must be selected with /CS low. A  /HOLD  condition will activate on \nthe falling edge of the /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the CLK is not already low the  /HOLD  \ncondition will activate after the next falling edge of CLK. The  /HOLD  condition will terminate on the rising \nedge of the  /HOLD  signal if the CLK signal is already low. If the  CLK is not already low the  /HOLD  condition \nwill terminate after the next falling edge of CLK.  During a  /HOLD  condition, the Serial Data Output (DO) is \nhigh impedance, a nd Serial Data Input (DI ) and Serial Clock (CLK) are ignored. The Chip Select ( /CS) \nsignal should be kept active (low) for the full duration of the  /HOLD  operation to avoid resetting the internal \nlogic state of the device.  \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \nPublication Release Date:  November  21, 2018  \n- 14 -                                    Revision C \n6.2 Write Protection  \nApplications that use non -volatile memory must take into consideration the possibility of noise and ot her \nadverse system conditions that may compromise data integrity. To address this concern , the W25N512G V \nprovides several means to protect the data from inadvertent writes.  \n \n\uf0b7 Device resets when VCC is below threshold  \n\uf0b7 Write enable/disable instructions  and a utomatic write disable after e rase or program  \n\uf0b7 Software and Hardware (/WP pin) write p rotection using Protection  Register  (SR-1) \n\uf0b7 Lock Down write protection for Protection  Register (SR-1) until the next power -up \n\uf0b7 One Time Program (OTP) write protection for memory array using Protection  Register  (SR-1) \n\uf0b7 Hardware write protection using /WP pin when WP -E is set to 1  \n \n \nUpon power -up or at power -down , the W25N512G V will maintain a reset condition while VCC is below the \nthreshold value of V WI, (See Power -up Timing and Voltage Levels and Figure 33a). While reset, all \noperations are disabled and no instructions are recognized. During power -up and after the VCC voltage \nexceeds V WI, all program and erase related instructions are further disabled f or a time delay of t PUW. This \nincludes the Write Enable, Program  Execute , Block Erase , Chip Erase  and the Write Status Register \ninstructions. Note that the chip select pin ( /CS) must track the VCC supply level at power -up until the VCC -\nmin level and t VSL time delay is reached , and it must also track the VCC supply level at power -down to \nprevent adverse command sequence. If needed a pull -up resister on /CS  can be used to accomplish this .  \nAfter power -up the device is automatically placed in a write -disabled state with the Status Register Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) set to a 0. A Write Enable instructi on must be issued before a Program  Execute , Block \nErase , Chip Erase  or Bad Block Management instruction  will be accepted. After completing a program or  \nerase instru ction the Write Enable Latch (WEL) is automatically cleared to a write -disabled state of 0.  \nSoftware controlled write protection is facilitated using the Write Status Register instruction and setting the \nStatus Register Protect (SRP 0, SRP1 ) and Block Protect (TB, BP[3:0]) bits. These settings  allow a portion \nor the entire  memory  array  to be configured as read only. Used in conjunction with the Write Protect ( /WP) \npin, changes to the Status Register can be enabled or disabled under hardware control. See Protection  \nRegister section for further information.  \nThe W P-E bit in Protection Register (SR -1) is used to  enable the hardware protection . When WP -E is set \nto 1, bringing /WP low in the system will block any Write/Program/Erase command to the W25N512G V, the \ndevice will become read -only. The Quad SPI operations are also disabled when WP -E is set to 1.  \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \n \n- 15 - \n7. PROTECTION, CONFIGURATION  AND STATUS  REGISTERS  \nThree Status Registers are provided for W25N512G V: Protection Register  (SR-1), Configuration Register \n(SR-2) & Status Register  (SR-3). Each register is accessed by Read Status Register and Write Status \nRegister commands combined with 1 -Byte Register A ddress respectively.  \nThe Read Status Register instruction  (05h / 0Fh) can be used to provide sta tus on the availability of the \nflash memory array, whether  the device is write enabled or disabled, the state of write protection , Read \nmodes, Protection Register /OTP area  lock status, Erase/Program results , ECC usage/status . The Write \nStatus  Register instruction can be used to configure the device  write protection features , Software/Hardware \nwrite protection, Read modes, enable/disable ECC, Protection Register/OTP area lock . Write access to the \nStatus Register is controlled by the state of the non-volatile  Status Register Protect bits (SRP 0, SRP1 ), the \nWrite Enable instruction, and when WP -E is set to 1 , the /WP pin .  \n7.1 Protection  Register  / Status Register -1 (Volatile Writable, OTP lockable)  \n \n \nFigure 4 a.

Block Protect bits can be set using the \nWrite Status Register Instruction. All, none or a portion of the memory array can be protected from Program \nand Erase instructions (see Status Register Memory Protection table). The default val ues for the Block \nProtection bits are  1 after power up to protect  the entire array . If the SR1 -L bit in the Configuration Register  \n(SR-2) is set to 1, the default values will the values that are OTP locked.   \nS7 S6 S5 S4 S3 S2 S1 S0\nSRP0 BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 TB\nStatus Register Protect-0\n(Volatile Writable, OTP Lock)\nTop/Bottom Protect Bit\n(Volatile Writable, OTP Lock)Block Protect Bits\n(Volatile Writable, OTP Lock)SRP1 WP-E\nStatus Register Protect-1\n(Volatile Writable, OTP Lock)/WP Enable Bit\n(Volatile Writable, OTP Lock)\nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \nPublication Release Date:  November  21, 2018  \n- 16 -                                    Revision C \n7.1.2  Write Protection Enable Bit (WP -E) – Volatile Writable , OTP lockable  \nThe Write Protection Enable bit  (WP-E) is a volatile read/write bits in the status register -1 (S1 ). The WP-E \nbit, in conjunction with SRP1 & SRP0,  control s the method of write protection: software protection, hardware \nprotection, pow er supply lock -down or one time programmable (OTP) protection , /WP pin functionality, and \nQuad SPI operation enable/disable . When WP -E = 0 (default value), the device is in Software Protection \nmode, /WP & /HOLD pins are multiplexed as IO pins, and Quad pro gram/read functions are enabled all the \ntime.  When WP -E is set to 1, the device is in Hardware Protection mode, all Quad functions are disabled \nand /WP & /HOLD pins become dedicated control input pins.  \n7.1.3  Status Register Protect  Bits (SRP 1, SRP0) – Volatile Writable , OTP lockable  \nThe Status Register Protect  bits (SRP 1 and SRP0 ) are volatile read/write bits in the status register (S 0 and \nS7).

Configuration Register / Status Register -2 (Address Bxh)  \n \n7.2.1  One Time Program Lock Bit  (OTP-L) – OTP lock able \nIn addition to the main memory array, W25N512G V also provides an OTP area for the system to store  \ncritical data that cannot be changed once it’s locked . The OTP area consists of 10 pages of 2,112 -Byte \neach. The default data in the OTP are a are FFh. Only Program command  can be issued to the OTP area \nto change the data from “1” to “0”, and data is not reversible (“0” to “1”) by the Erase command. Once the \ncorrect data is programmed in and verif ied, the system developer can set OTP -L bit to 1, so that the entire \nOTP area will be locked to prevent further alteration to the data.  \n7.2.2  Enter OTP Access Mode Bit (OTP -E) – Volatile Writable  \nThe OTP -E bit must be set to 1 in order to use the standard Progra m/Read commands to access the OTP \narea as well as to read the Unique ID / Parameter Page information . The default value after power up or a \nRESET command is 0.  \n7.2.3  Status Register -1 Lock Bit (SR1 -L) – OTP lock able \nThe SR1 -L lock bit is used to OTP lock the val ues in the Protection Register ( SR-1). Depending on the \nsettings in the SR -1, the device can be configured to have a portion of or up to the entire array to be write -\nprotected, and the setting can be OTP locked by setting SR1 -L bit to 1. SR1 -L bit can only  be set to 1 \npermanently when SRP1 & SRP0 are set to (1,1), and OTP Access M ode must be entered (OTP -E=1) to \nexecute the programming.  Please refer to 8.2.26 for detailed information.  \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \nPublication Release Date:  November  21, 2018  \n- 18 -                                    Revision C \n7.2.4  ECC Enable Bit  (ECC -E) – Volatile Writable  \nW25N512G V has a built -in ECC algorithm that can be used to preserve the data integrity . Internal ECC \ncalculation is done during page programming, and the result is stored in the extra 64 -Byte area for each \npage. During the data read operation, ECC engine will verify the data values ac cording to the previously \nstored ECC information and to make necessary corrections if needed. The verification and correction status \nis indicated by the ECC Status Bits.  ECC function is enabled by default when power on (ECC -E=1), and it \nwill not be reset t o 0 by the Device Reset command.  \n7.2.5  Buffer Read / Continuous Read Mode Bit (BUF) – Volatile Writable  \nW25N512G V provides two different modes for read operations, Buffer Read Mode (BUF=1) and Continuous \nRead Mode (BUF=0). Prior to any Read operation, a Page Data Read command is needed to initiate the \ndata transfer from a specified page in the memory array to the Data Buffer. By default, after power up, the \ndata in page 0 will be automatically loaded into the Data Buffer and  the device is ready to accept any read \ncommands.  \nThe Buffer Read Mode  (BUF=1)  requires a Column Address to start outputting the existing data inside the \nData Buffer, and once it reaches th e end of the data buffer (Byte 2,111), DO (IO1)  pin will become hig h-Z \nstate.  \nThe Continuous Read Mode (BUF=0) doesn’t require the starting Column Address. The device will always \nstart output the data from the first column (Byte 0) of the Data buffer, and once the end of the data buffer  \n(Byte 2,048)  is reached, the data output will continue through the next memory page. With Continuous \nRead Mode, it is poss ible to read out the entire memory array using a single read command.  Please refer \nto respective command descriptions for the dummy cycle requirem ents for each read commands under \ndifferent read modes.  \nFor W25N512GV xIG part number, t he default value of BUF bit after power up is  1. BUF bit can be written \nto 0 in the Status Register -2 to perform the Continuous Read operation . \nFor W25N512GV xIT part number, the default value of BUF bit after power up is 0. BUF bit can be written \nto 1 in the Status Register -2 to perform the Buffer Read operation.  \nBUF ECC -E Read Mode  \n(Starting from Buffer)  ECC Status  Data Output  Structure  \n1 0 Buffer Read  N/A 2,048 + 64  \n1 1 Buffer Read  Page based  2,048 + 64  \n0 0 Continuous Read  N/A 2,048  \n0 1 Continuous Read  Operation based  2,048  \n \n  \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \n \n- 19 - \n7.2.6  Output Driver Strength (ODS -1, ODS -0) – Volatile Writable  \n \nODS -1, ODS -0 Output Driver Strength  \n0, 0 100%  \n0, 1 75% \n1, 0 50% (default)  \n1, 1 25% \n \n7.2.7  Hold Disable (H -DIS) - Volatile Writable  \nWhen the Hold Disable (H -DIS) bit set to 1, the hold function would be disabled.

Status Register -3 (Address Cxh)  \n \n7.3.1  Look -Up Table Full (LUT -F) – Status Only   \nTo facilitate the NAND flash memory bad block management, the W25N512G V is equipped with an internal \nBad Block Management Look -Up-Table (BBM LUT) . Up to 10 bad memory blocks may be  replaced by a \ngood memory block  respectively . The addresses of the blocks are stored in the internal Look -Up Table as \nLogical Block Address (LBA, the bad block) & Physical Block Address (PBA, the good block). The L UT-F \nbit indicates whether the 1 0 memory block links have been fully utilized or not.

The WEL status bit is cleared to 0 when the device is write disabled. A write disable \nstate occurs upon power -up or after any of the following instructions: Write Disable, Program  Execute , \nBlock /Chip  Erase, Page Data Read , Program Execute and Bad Block Management for OTP pages . \n7.3.5  Erase/ Program  In Progress (BUSY) – Status Only   \nBUSY is a read only bit in the status register (S0) that is set to a 1 state when the device is powering up or \nexecuting a Page Data Read, Bad Block Management, Program  Execute , Block /Chip  Erase, Program \nExecute for OTP area , OTP L ocking  or after a Continuous Read  instruction. During this time the device will \nignore further instructions except for th e Read Status Register and Read JEDEC ID  instruction s. When the \nprogram, erase or write status register instruction has completed, the BUSY bit will be cleared to a 0 state \nindicating the device is ready for further instructions.   \n7.3.6  Reserved Bits – Non Funct ional  \nThere are a few reserved Status Register bits that may be read out as a “0” or “1”. It is recommended to \nignore the values of those bits. During a “Write Status Register” instruction, the Reserved Bits can be written \nas “0”, but there will not be any  effects.  \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \nPublication Release Date:  November  21, 2018  \n- 22 -                                    Revision C \n7.4 W25N512GV  Status Register Memory Protection  \nSTATUS REGISTER(1) W25N512G V (512M -BIT / 64M-BYTE ) MEMORY PROTECTION(2) \nTB BP3 BP2 BP1 BP0 PROTECTED  \nBLOCK(S)  PROTECTED  \nPAGE ADDRESS  \nPA[15:0]  PROTECTED  \nDENSITY  PROTECTED  \nPORTION  \nX 0 0 0 0 NONE  NONE  NONE  NONE  \n0 0 0 0 1 511 7FC0h - 7FFFh  128KB Upper 1/512  \n0 0 0 1 0 510 & 511  7F80h - 7FFFh  256KB  Upper 1/256  \n0 0 0 1 1 508 thru 511  7F00h - 7FFFh  512KB  Upper 1/128  \n0 0 1 0 0 504 thru 511  7E00h - 7FFFh  1MB Upper 1/64  \n0 0 1 0 1 496 thru 511 7C00h - 7FFFh  2MB Upper 1/32  \n0 0 1 1 0 480 thru 511  7800h - 7FFFh  4MB Upper 1/16  \n0 0 1 1 1 448 thru 511  7000h - 7FFFh  8MB Upper 1/8  \n0 1 0 0 0 384 thru 511  6000h - 7FFFh  16MB  Upper 1/4  \n0 1 0 0 1 256 thru 511  4000h - 7FFFh  32MB  Upper 1/2  \n1 0 0 0 1 0 0000h - 003Fh 128KB  Lower 1/512  \n1 0 0 1 0 0 & 1 0000h - 007Fh 256KB  Lower 1/256  \n1 0 0 1 1 0 thru 3  0000h - 00FFh 512KB  Lower 1/128  \n1 0 1 0 0 0 thru 7 0000h - 01FFh 1MB Lower 1/64  \n1 0 1 0 1 0 thru 15  0000h - 03FFh  2MB Lower 1/32  \n1 0 1 1 0 0 thru 31  0000h - 07FFh 4MB Lower 1/16  \n1 0 1 1 1 0 thru 63  0000h - 0FFFh  8MB Lower 1/8  \n1 1 0 0 0 0 thru 127  0000h - 1FFFh  16MB  Lower 1/4  \n1 1 0 0 1 0 thru 255  0000h - 3FFFh  32MB  Lower 1/2  \nX 1 0 1 X 0 thru 511  0000h - 7FFFh  64MB  ALL \nX 1 1 X X 0 thru 511  0000h - 7FFFh  64MB  ALL \n \nNote s: \n1.

INSTRUCTIONS  \nThe Standard/Dual/Quad SPI instruction set of the W25N512G V consists of 31 basic instructions that are \nfully controlled through the SPI bus (see Instruction Set Table1, 2). Instructions are initiated with the falling \nedge of Chip Select (/CS) . The first byte of data clo cked into the DI  input provides the i nstruction code. \nData o n the DI  input is sampled on the rising edge of clock with mo st significant bit (MSB) first.  \nInstructions vary in length from a single byte to several bytes and may be followed by address bytes, data \nbytes, dummy bytes (don’t care), and in some cases, a co mbination. Instructions are completed with the \nrising edge of edge  /CS. Clock relative timing diagrams for each instruction are included in Figures 5 through \n32. All read instructions can be completed after any clocked bit. However, all instructions that W rite, \nProgram or Erase must complete on a byte boundary ( /CS driven high after a full 8 -bits have been clocked) \notherwise the instruction will be ignor ed. This feature further protects the device from inadvertent writes. \nAdditionally, while the device is perform ing Program or Erase operation , BBM management , Page Data \nRead or OTP locking operations, BUSY bit will be high, and all instructions except for Read Status Register \nor Read JEDEC ID will be ignored until the current operation  cycle has completed.  \n8.1 Device ID and Instruction Set Tables  \n8.1.1  Manufacturer and Device Identification  \nMANUFACTURER ID  (MF7 -

Note that the WEL bit is automatically reset after Power -up and upon \ncompletion of the Page Program, Quad Page Program , Block Erase , Chip Erase , Reset  and Bad Block \nManagem ent instructions . \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 1 2 0 4 5 3 6 7\nMode 0Mode 3\nHigh ImpedanceInstruction (04h)\n \nFigure 10. Write Dis able Instruction  \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \n \n- 33 - \n8.2.7  Bad Block Management (A1 h) \nDue to large NAND memory density size and the technology limitation, NAND memory devices are allowed \nto be  shipped to the end customers with certain amount of “Bad Blocks” found in the factory testing. Up to \n2% of the memory blocks can be marked as “Bad Blocks” upon s hipment, which is a maximum of 1 0 blocks \nfor W25N512G V. In order to identify these bad blocks,  it is recommended to scan the entire memory array \nfor bad block markers set in the factory. A “Bad Block Marker” is a non -FFh data byte stored at Byte 0 of \nPage 0 for each bad block. An additional marker is also stored  in the first byte of the 64 -Byte spa re area.  \nW25N512G V offers a convenient method to manage the bad blocks typically found in NAND flash memory \nafter extensive use . The “ Bad Block Management” command is initiated by shifting the instruction code \n“A1h” into the DI pin and followed by the 16 -bit “Logical Block Address” and 16 -bit “Physical Block Address”  \nas illustrated in Figure 11 . A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the \nBad Block Management Instructions (Status Register bit WEL= 1). The logical block addr ess is the address \nfor the “bad” block that will be replaced by the “good” block indicated by the physical block address.  \nOnce a Bad Block Management command is successfully executed, the specified LBA -PBA link will be \nadded to the inter nal Look Up Table ( LUT). Up to 1 0 links can be established in the non -volatile LUT. If all \n10 links have been written, the LUT -F bit in the Status Register will become a 1, and no more LBA -PBA \nlinks can be established. Therefore, prior to issuing the Bad Block Management com mand, the LUT -F bit \nvalue can be checked or a “Read BBM Look Up Table” command can be issued to confirm if spare links \nare still available in the LUT.   \nRegistering the same address in multiple PBAs is prohibited. It may cause unexpected behavior.  \n7\nHigh Impedance8 15 23/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0\nInstruction\nA1h31\n[15:8] [7:0] [15:8] [7:0]24 16 32 39\nPBA LBAMode 0Mode 3\n \nFigure 11.

The “Read BBM Look Up  Table” command can be used to check the existing address links \nstored inside the LUT.  \nThe “Read BBM Look Up Table” command is initiated by shifting the instruction code “A5h” into the DI pin \nand followed by 8 -bit dummy clocks, at the falling edge of the 1 6th clocks, the device will start to output the \n16-bit “Logical Block Address” and the 16 -bit “Physical Block Address”  as illustrated in Figure 12. All block \naddress links will be output sequentially starting from the first link (LBA0 & PBA0) in the LUT. If there are \navailable links that are unused, the output will contain all “ 00h” data.  \nThe MSB bits LBA[15:14] of each link are used to indicate the status of the link.  \nLBA[15]  \n(Enable)  LBA[14]  \n(Invalid)  Descriptions  \n0 0 This link is available to use.  \n1 0 This link is enabled and it is a valid link.  \n1 1 This link was enabled, but it  is not valid any more.  \n0 1 Not applicable.  \n \n  \n7\nHigh Impedance8 15 23\n8 Dummy \nClocks/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0\nInstruction\nA5h31\nLBA0\n* = MSB** *[15:8] [7:0] [15:8] [7:0] [15:8]PBA024 16 32 3940 4748\n \nFigure 12.

When the ECC -E bit in the Status/Configuration Register is set to 1 (also power up default), \nthe internal ECC algorithm is enabled for all Program and Read  operations. During a “Program Execute” \ncommand for a specific page, the ECC algorithm will calculate the ECC information based on the data \ninside the 2K -Byte data buffer and write the ECC data into the extra 64 -Byte ECC area in the same physical \nmemory pa ge. \nDuring the Read operations, ECC information will be used to verify the data read out from the physical \nmemory array and possible corrections can be made to limited amount of data bits that contain errors. The \nECC Status Bits (ECC -1 & ECC -0) will also be set indicating the result of ECC calculation.  \nFor the “Cont inuous Read Mode (BUF=0)” operation, multiple pages of main array data can be read out \ncontinuously by issuing a single read command. Upon finishing the read operation, the ECC status bits \nshoul d be check to verify if there’s any ECC correction or un -correctable errors existed in the read out data. \nIf ECC -1 & ECC -0 equal to (1, 0) or (1, 1), the previous read out data contain one or more pages that \ncontain ECC un -correctable errors. The failure p age address (or the last page address if it’s multiple pages) \ncan be obtained by issuing the “Last ECC failure Page Address” command as illustrated in Figure 13. The \n16-bit Page Address that contains un -correctable ECC errors will be presented on the DO pi n following the \ninstruction code “A9h” and 8 -bit dummy clocks on the DI pin.  \n7\nHigh Impedance8 9 151617 293031\n151413 2 1 08 Dummy \nClocks\nPage Address[15:0]Mode 0Mode 3/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0\nInstruction\nA9h\n \nFigure 13.

A Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the \nBlock Erase Instruction (Status Register bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the \n/CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “D8h” followed by 8-bit dummy clocks and the 16 -bit page \naddress . The Block Erase instructio n sequence is shown in Figure 14 . \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit of the last byte has been latched. If this is not done the \nBlock Erase instruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed Block Erase instruction \nwill commence for a time duration of t BE (See AC Characteristics). While the Block Erase cycle is in \nprogress, the Read S tatus Register instruction may still be accessed for checking the status of the BUSY \nbit. The BUSY bit is a 1 during the Block Erase cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the \ndevice is ready to accept other instructions again. After the Bloc k Erase cycle has finished the Write Enable \nLatch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Block Erase instruction will not b e executed if \nthe addressed block  is protected by the Block Protect ( TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits. \n7\nHigh Impedance8 9 151617 293031\n151413 2 1 08 Dummy \nClocksPage Address[15:0]Mode 0Mode 3/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0\nInstruction\nD8h\n \nFigure 14. 128KB Block Erase Instruction  \n \nW25N512GV xIG/IT  \n \n \n- 37 - \n8.2.11  Load Program Data  (02h) / Random Load Program Data (84h)  \nThe Program opera tion allows from one byte to 2,112 bytes (a page) of data to be programmed at previously \nerased  (FFh) memory locations. A Program  operation involves two steps: 1. Load the program data into \nthe Data Buffer. 2. Issue “Program Execute” command to transfer the data from Data Buffer to the specified \nmemory page.  \nA Write Enable instruction must be executed before the device will accept t he Load  Program  Data  \nInstruction s (Status Register bit WEL= 1).  The “Load Program Data” or “Random Load Program Data” \ninstruction is initiated by driving the  /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “02h”  or “84h”  followed by \na 16-bit column address (only CA[11:0] is effective) and at least one byte of data into the DI pin. The  /CS \npin must be held low for the entire length of the instruction while data is being sent to the device. If the \nnumber of data bytes sent to the device  exceeds the number of d ata bytes in the Data Buffer, the extra \ndata will be ignored by the device . The Load Program Data instruction sequence is shown in Figure 15. \nBoth “Load Program Data” and “Random Load Program Data” instructions share the same command \nsequence . The differen ce is that “Load Program Data” instruction will reset the unused the data bytes in \nthe Data Buffer to FFh value, while “Random Load Program Data” instruction will only update  the data bytes \nthat are specified by the command input sequence, the rest of the Data Buffer will remain unchanged.  \nIf internal ECC algorithm is enabled, all 2,112  bytes of data will be accepted, b ut the bytes designated for \nECC parity bits in the extra 64 bytes section will be overwritten by the ECC calculation . If the ECC -E bit is \nset to a 0 to disable the internal ECC, the extra 64 bytes section can be used for external ECC purpose or \nother usage. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 7\nInstruction\nHigh Impedance8 9 212223\n151413 02h / 84h 2 1 0Column Address[15:0]24\n1 0 7 6 1 0 7 6 7Data-0 Data-1303132 3839 24/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)7\n0 1 0 7 640\nHigh ImpedanceMode 0Mode 3\nData-2111\n \nFigure 15.

This method will significantly shorten  the data input time when a large amount of data \nneeds to be loaded  into the Data Buffer . The instruction sequence is illus trated in Figure 16.  \nBoth “Quad Load Program Data” and “Quad Random Load Program Data” instructions share the same \ncommand sequence . The difference is that “Quad Load Program Data” instruction will reset the unused the \ndata bytes in the Data Buffer to FFh  value, while “Quad Random Load Program Data” instruction will only \nupdate the data bytes that are specified by the command input sequence, the rest of the Data Buffer will \nremain unchanged.  \nWhen WP -E bit in the Status Register is set to a 1, all Quad SPI instructions are disabled. \n/CS\nCLK\nDI\n(IO0)\nDO\n(IO1)Mode 0Mode 3 0 7\nInstruction\nHigh Impedance8 232425\n15 32h / 34h 0\nData\n02627\n4 0\n5 1\nIO2High Impedance\n6 2\n/Hold\n(IO3)High\n7 34 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 34 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 34 0\n5 1\n6 2\n7 3\nData\n1Data\n2111Column \nAddr[15:0]Mode 0Mode 3\n \nFigure 16.

The instruction is initiated by driving th e /CS pin low then shifting the instruction code “ 10h” \nfollowed by 8-bit dummy clocks and the 16 -bit Page Address into the DI pin  as shown in Figure 17. \nAfter /CS is driven high  to complete the instruction cycle, the self -timed Program  Execute  instruction will \ncommence for a time duration of tpp (See AC C haracteristics). While the Program Execute cycle is in \nprogress, the Read Status Register instruction may still be used for checking the status of the BUSY bit. \nThe BUSY bit is a 1 during the P rogram Execute cycle and becomes a 0 when the cycle is finished and the \ndevice is ready to accept other ins tructions again. After the Program Execute cycle has finished, the Write \nEnable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status Register is cleared to 0. The Program Execute instruction will not be \nexecuted if the addressed page is protected by the Block Protect (TB, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits. Only 4 \npartial page program times are allowed on every single page.  \nThe pages within the block have to be programmed sequentially  from the lower order page address to the \nhigher order page address within the block.

Then, \nRead operations can be performed on Unique ID and Parameter Pages, Read and Program operations can \nbe performed on the OTP pages if it’s not already locked.  To return to the main memory array operation, \nOTP-E bit needs to be to set to 0.  \nRead Operations  \nA “Page Data Read” command must be issued followed by a specific page address shown in the table \nabove to load the page data into the main Data Buffer. After the device finishes the data loading (BUSY=0), \nall Read commands may be used to read the Data Buffer starting from any specified Column  Address. \nPlease note all Read commands must now follow the “Buffer Read Mode” command structure (CA[15:0], \nnumber of dummy clocks) regardless the previous BUF bit setting.  ECC can also be enabled for the OTP \npage read operations to ensure the data integrity.  \nProgram and O TP Lock Operations  \nOTP pages provide the additional space (2K -Byte x 10) to store important data or security information that \ncan be locked to prevent further modification in the field. These OTP pages are in an erased state set in \nthe factory, and can onl y be programmed (change data from “1” to “0”) until being locked by OTP -L bit in \nthe Configuration/Status Register -2. OTP-E must be first set to “1” to enable the access to these OTP \npages, then the program data must be loaded into the m ain Data Buffer usi ng any “Program Data Load” \ncommands. The “Program Execute” command followed by a specific OTP Page Address is used to initiate \nthe data transfer from the Data Buffer to the OTP page.  When ECC is enabled, ECC calculation will be \nperformed during “Program Ex ecute”, and the ECC information will be stored into the 64 -Byte spare area.  \nOnce the OTP pages are correctly programmed, OTP -L bit can be used to permanently lock these pages \nso that no further modification is possible. While still in the “OTP Access Mode”  (OTP -E=1), user needs to \nset OTP -L bit in the Configuration/Status Register -2 to “1”, and issue a “Program Execute”  command (Page \naddress is “don’t care”) . After the device finishes the OTP lock setting (BUSY=0), the user can set OTP -E \nto “0” to return to the main memory array operation.  \nSR1-L OTP Lock Operation  \nThe Protection/Status Register -1 contains protection bits that can be set to protect either a portion or the \nentire memory array from being Programmed/Erased or set the device to either Software Write Protection \n(WP-E=0) or Hardware Write Protection (WP -E=1). Once the BP[3:0], TB, WP -E bits are set correctly, \nSRP1 and SRP0 should also be set to “1” s as well to allow SR 1-L bit being set to “1” to permanently lock \nthe protection settings in the Status Register -1 (SR1). Similar to the OTP -L setting procedure above, in \norder to set SR1 -L lock bit, the device must enter the “OTP Access Mode” (OTP -E=1) first, and SR1 -L bit \nshould be set to “1” prior to the “Program Execute” command (Page address is “don’t care”) .

The lower pow er consumption makes the Power -Down \ninstruction especially useful for battery powered applicat ions (See ICC1 and ICC2 in AC Characteristics). \nThe instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the instruction code “B9h” as shown in \nFigure 30.  \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Power -down \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the power -down state will entered within the time \nduration of t DP (See AC Characteristics) . While in the power -down state only the Release Power -down / \nDevice ID (ABh) instruction, which restores the device to normal operation, will be recognized. All other \ninstructions are ignored. This includes the Read Status Register instruction, which is a lways available \nduring normal operation. Ignoring all but one instruction makes the Power Down state a useful condition for \nsecuring maximum write protection. The device always powers -up in the normal operation with the standby \ncurrent of ICC1.  \n \n \nFigure 30.

Release from power -down will take \nthe time duration of t RES (See AC Characteristics) before the device will resume normal operation and other \ninstructions are accept ed.

A Write \nEnable instruction must be executed before the device will accept the Chip Erase Instruction (Status \nRegister bit WEL must equal 1). The instruction is initiated by driving the /CS pin low and shifting the \ninstruction code “C7h”  or “60h” . The Chip Erase instruction sequence is shown in Figure 32. \nThe /CS pin must be driven high after the eighth bit has been latched. If this is not done the Chip Erase \ninstruction will not be executed. After /CS is driven high, the self -timed Chip Erase ins truction will commence \nfor a time duration of t CE (See AC Characteristics). While the Chip Erase cycle is in progress, the Read \nStatus Register instruction may still be accessed to check the status of the BUSY bit. The BUSY bit is a 1 \nduring the Chip Erase  cycle and becomes a 0 when finished and the device is ready to accept other \ninstructions again. After the Chip Erase cycle has finished the Write Enable Latch (WEL) bit in the Status \nRegister is cleared to 0. The Chip Erase instruction will not be execute d if any memory region is protected \nby the Block Protect ( TB, BP3, BP2, BP1, and BP0) bits.  \n \n \nFigure 32.

INVALID BLOCK MANAGE MENT  \n10.1 Invalid blocks  \nThe W25N512 GV may have initial  invalid blocks when it ships from factory . Also, additional  invalid blocks \nmay develop during the use of the device. Nvb represents  the minimum number of valid blocks in the total \nnumber of available  blocks (See the below t able). An invalid block  is defined as blocks that contain one or \nmore bad bits. Block 0 , block address 00h is guaranteed to be a valid block at the time of shipment.  \nParameter  Symbol  Min Max Unit \nValid block number  Nvb 502 512 blocks  \nValid Block Number  \n10.2 Initial invalid blocks  \nInitial  invalid blocks are defined as blocks that contain one or more invalid bits when shipped from factory .  \nAlthough the device contain s initial invalid  blocks, a  valid block of the device is of the same quality and \nreliability as all valid block s in the  devic e with reference to  AC and DC specifications. The W25N512 GV \nhas internal circuits to isolate each block from other blocks an d therefore , the invalid block s will not affect \nthe performance of the entire device.   \nBefore  the device is shipped from the factory,  it will be erased and invalid block s are marked . All initial \ninvalid blocks are marked with non-FFh at  the 1st byte of main array and the 1st byte of spare area o n the  \n1st page. The initial invalid block information cannot be recovered if inadvertently erased . Therefore, \nsoftware should be created to initially check for invalid blocks by reading the marked location s before  \nperforming any program or erase operation , and create a table of initial invalid block s as following flow chart . \nStart\nCheck “FFh”\nYesSet Block Address = 0\nIncrement \nBlock Address\nUpdate \nBad Block TableNo\nLast Block?No\nYes\nEndCheck “FFh” at 1st byte of main array of 1st page or \n1st byte of spare area of the 1st page in the block\n \nFigure 35 .
