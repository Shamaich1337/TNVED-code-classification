Unlike conventional MOSFET drivers, which require  \nan external power supply to provide V CC and or V DD rails to  \nthe driver itself, the VOM1271  obtains all the required  \ncurrent   to drive its internal circuitry from the LED current on  \nthe low voltage primary side of the isolation barrier. This  \nsaves the designer the spac e and cost associated with  \nproviding one or more exte rnal power supplies. The  \nVOM1271 also integrates a turn-off circuit internal to the  \ncomponent itself, thus doing away with the need for  \nadditional components in orde r to increase the overall  \nswitching speed by decreasing  the turn-off time. These  \nfeatures, combined with a small SOP4 package, provide  \ndesigners with a small footprint , highly integrated isolated  \ngate driver solution for  a la rge variety of MOSFET driver  \napplications.FEATURES\n• Open circuit voltage at I F = 10 mA, 8.4 V typical\n• Short circuit current at I F = 10 mA, 15 μA typical\n• Isolation test voltage 3750 V RMS\n• Logic compatible input• High reliability• Integrated rapid turn-off circuitry• Material categorization:  \nfor    definitions    of    compliance    please    see  \nwww.vishay.com/doc?99912\nAPPLICATIONS\n• High-side driver• Solid-state relays• Floating power supply• Power control• Data acquisition•A T E• Isolated solenoid drivers• Isolated high current relay drivers• Isolated high voltage relay drivers\nAGENCY APPROVALS\n•UL\n•cUL\n•VDE\n•FIMKO\nNote• For additional information on the available options refer to option information.

#### Description:
The VOM1271 is a photovoltaic MOSFET driver with integrated fast turn-off capabilities, designed for applications requiring high-speed switching and isolation. Unlike traditional MOSFET drivers that necessitate external power supplies, the VOM1271 derives all necessary power from the LED current on the low-voltage side of the isolation barrier. This feature not only simplifies the design but also reduces the overall footprint of the circuit.

#### Typical Applications:
The VOM1271 is suitable for a variety of applications, including:
- High-side MOSFET driving
- Solid-state relays
- Floating power supplies
- Power control systems
- Data acquisition systems
- Automated Test Equipment (ATE)
- Isolated solenoid drivers
- Isolated high-current and high-voltage relay drivers

This component is particularly useful in scenarios where space and component count need to be minimized while maintaining high performance and reliability.
