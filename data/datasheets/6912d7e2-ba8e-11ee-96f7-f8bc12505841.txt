Analogue control  description  \n16.1. Laser D river  Enable  / TEC Enable  \nThe " Enable " contacts are logic  inputs . \nApply high level to «TEC Enable»  pin to start temperature stabilization . Apply low level to \n«TEC Enable»  pin to stop temperature stabilization.  \nApply high level to «Laser Driver Enable»  pin to ini tiate  soft-start sequence of laser diode \ndriver .  Apply low level to «Laser Driver Enable»  pin to stop the driver .  \nThe enable features are duplicated with on-off switch es located on the board (7  in Fig. 9). \n16.2. TEC Error  \nThe «TEC Error» contact is logic output.  \nTEC error  signal generates  in overcurrent , short -circuit or circuitry overheat  condition . \nIf an error occurs  «TEC Error»  pin becomes  high.  \nA TEC error stops the laser  driver. To reset the error, restart the device . \n16.3. Laser Driver Overcurrent  \nThe «Laser Driver Overcurrent»  contact is logic output.  \nThe «Laser Driver Overcurrent»  pin is intended for monitoring the status of the protection \ncircuits. When the current protection is activated, the laser driver  stops, the output terminals are \nshunted, the LED on the board lights up  red. The high logic level in the contact indicates the \npres ence of shunting of the output terminals. The current generator cannot  be restarted after the \nprotection has tripped.  To reset  the protection, restart  the driver.  \n16.4. Reference voltage  2.5V \nThe «+2.5V» pin is intended for supplying a reference voltage to external potentiometers  \netc. , which  may be  used for current and temperature  setting . \n16.5. Laser Current Set  \nThe «Laser Current Set»  pin is an analog input . \nThe «Laser Current Set » is intended for setting the  driver output  current amplitude. A pply \nvoltage to the  «Laser Current Set»  with respect to GND  to control the output current . Signal \nresolution depends on driver model , maximum amplitude of the signal  is 2.5V.  \nThe «Laser Current Set»  pin can be used for analogue modulation by applying sign, square or \nramp signal with the DC component. Please, control the output current while using this feature. In \nthis case, the value of the DC component determines the average current in the load, and the \namplitude of the signal determines  the modulation amplitude.  It is necessary to ensure that the \ncurrent for analog modulation does not exceed the current protection threshold. Analogue \nmodulation amplitude depends on frequency.  \nATTENTION! If you use arbit rary/function generator or lab PS for current set, make sure it is in High Z \nmode , please, control the current set and current monitor pin voltages while getting started.  When you \nusing a generator with an output "50 Ohms", the value on the screen of the device can be less than the \nactually set 2 times. Be careful, moni tor the voltage on the contact  «Laser Current Set»  with  an \noscilloscope.  \n  \nMaiman Electronics                                     SF8025, SF8075 , SF8150, SF8300  \n13 16.6. TEC temperature  set \nThe «TEC temperature set»  pin is an analog input . \nThe «TEC temperature set»  is intended for setting the  desired  temperature of laser module . \nApply voltage to the «TEC temperature set»  with respect to GND  to set the desired  temperature . \nThe applied voltage must correspond to the desired resistance of the thermistor.  \nThe specified voltage U [V] is related to the resistance of the thermistor R [Ohm] by the \nformula:  \n        \n           \nFor example, to obtai n a thermistor resistance of 10 000 Ohm, a voltage of 1.25 V must be \napplied to the «TEC temperature set» pin. The 10 kOhm resistance corresponds to 25 ° C for the \nNTC thermistor 10k.  A lower input voltage corresponds to a lower resistance of the thermistor \n(higher temperature) and vice versa.  \nWhen translating the resistance of the thermistor to the temperature t [° C], it is necessary \nto consider  the coefficient B25 / 100 [K], specified in the manufacturer\'s specifications : \n    \n   \n     \n         \n              \n16.7. Driver current monitor  \nThe output current of the driver can be monitored by current monitor.  \n16.8. TEC temperature  monitor  \nThe «TEC temperature monitor » pin is an analog output and allows to track the temperature \nof the laser diode.  \nProportions described in paragraph 1 6.6 are  valid for this Pin.  \n16.9. NTC Interlock  (External t hermistor connection ) \nThis a llows to measure the temperature of a laser diode or other devices. The measurement \nresult is read able by the digital interface. You can s et upper and lower limits of the temperature \nusing the digital interface (with command or software).  If the temperature goes beyond  the limits , \nthe driver operation is blocked.  When the temperature returns to the specified range, the driver \noperation resumes.  After setting , limits will be saved in device memory and will work when used \nboth digital and  analogue control .  \n17. Current / Temperature setting variants  \nParameter s can be set in three ways: using  potentiometer, analog control connector or \ndigital commands .

You can use any diodes that \nare suitable for the current you want to operate. Dummy load should be connected as load. LD+ to \nthe anode and LD - to the cathode.   \nPlease don’t turn on TEC if you have not connected a dummy load to the TEC pins.   \nConnect the controls (analogue and/or digital).  \nConnect the power supply (note polarity).   \n18.1. Interlock  \nThe driver has interlock. This is pin 15 of the analog control connector. If you left this pin \nopen the driver is in the locked state.  This p in must be connected to any GND pin for normal \noperation.  \nThe driver and the temperature controller can only be turned on with shorted Interlock.   \nYou can also connect something like an emergency button to this pin.   \nBy default at power up the driver is in the "allow interlock" state.  Via USB you can set the \ndriver to the "deny interlock" state. At this case the driver will ignore  interlock state and can \noperate with opened pin 15.   \n18.2. NTC Interlock  \nThe driver can only be turned on with  installed LD . When driver  is turn ed on without the \ninstalled LD, the operation and measure values  will be incorrect!  If it is necessary  to turn on the \ndriver without the installed LD, connect 10kOhm resistor to thermistor pins (2nd and 5th) on LD \nmount.   \n18.3. Change the current  limit on the Peltier module  \nIf it is necessary, the level of current limit on the Peltier module can be changed before \nconnecting the laser diode using digital control connection (see paragraph 20).  \n18.4. Change the current protection threshold of the driver  \nThe current protection threshold level sets with DRV OC potentiometer. The set level can be \nseen in the software  or requested by a digital command . Set the current protection threshold to \nthe required level before turn on the laser diode current . \nIf it is necessary, the current protection threshold can be changed using analog controls . \nMake sure that the jumper DRIV ER SHORT is installed. CURRENT control selector must be in the \nINT position to use the CURRENT potentiometer.  \nMaiman Electronics                                     SF8025, SF8075 , SF8150, SF8300  \n15 Connect the measuring instrument to the «Driver Current Monitor» pin.  \nIf it is necessary to increase the limitation level, turn the potentiometer  DRV OC clockwise \nfor a few turns.  \nTurn on the driver. Set the current equal to the desired current protection threshold with \nthe potentiometer CURRENT. Then slowly turn the potentiometer DRV OC counterclockwise until \nthe protection is activated. Restart t he driver to reset an error. Make sure that the protection is \ntrigge red at the correct current level . \nYou can also set the current level by analogue or digital signals.  \nSet current to zero, turn off the driver.  \n18.5. How to control by digital signals  \nUse the d igital control connector . You can use UART or RS -232.  The USB -UART converter can \nbe used (optional) to connect the device to computer.  \nSee paragraphs 22-23. \n18.6. How to control by analogue signals  \nCURRENT  and TEC control selectors  must be in the EXT position . \nUse the analogue  control connector .  \nIf you connect pins 2 and 3 to pin 1 (5V) before power up the device, the driver                        \nwill not turn on.  \nSee paragraph 1 6. \n18.7. How to control by board switches  \nCURRENT  and TEC control selectors must be in the INT position .  \nUse t wo-position  switch  to start/stop laser diode  driver or temperature stabilization . If you \nset onboard switch to ON before power up the device, the driver will not turn on .  \nTurn CURRENT potentiometer  (9 in Fig. 9) clockwise to increa ses the value  of driver output  \ncurrent amplitude , counterclockwise – to reduce .  \nTurn TEC potentiometer (10 in Fig. 9) clockwise to increases the desired  temperature of laser \nmodule , counterclockwise – to reduce .  \n19. PID coefficients  \nThe device allows you to set P, I and D coefficients independently of each other . The \ncoefficients can be set in software or using digital  commands.  \nThe PID regulator works regardless of the control mode , both in analog and digital modes . \nThe default values are shown in the table . In most cases, default configuration will work well \nwith butterfly laser diodes.   \nThere may be instability in the operation of the thermal controller on some DFB diodes. In \nthis case, set the configuration for DFB diodes.  \nSetup  P coefficient  I coefficient  D coefficient  \nDefault  100 1000 0 \nDFB laser  20 1000  1000  \nProportional coefficient sets direct response to the error signal . The value 100 is equal to a \nmultiplier of 1, t he value of 20 is equal to a multiplier of 0.2.  \nMaiman Electronics                                     SF8025, SF8075 , SF8150, SF8300  \n16 Larger proportiona l gain result  is larger changes in response to the error, and thus affects \nthe speed at which the controller can respond to changes in the system. While a high proportional \ngain can cause a circuit to respond swiftly, too high a value can cause oscillations. Too low a value \nand the circuit cannot efficiently respond to changes in the system.  \nIntegral control helps compensate for steady -state error . \nLow values  of the integral regulator  lead to quick compensation, but can cause oscillations.  \nToo large values lead to slow compensation . Zero  value disables the integral regulator.  \nDerivative control attempts to reduce the overshoot and ringing potential from proportional \nand integral control. Derivative control slows the response of the circuit. High gain values cause \nthe circuit to respond very slowly and can leave one susceptible to noise and high frequency \noscillation . Zero  value disables the derivative regulator.  \nBefore fine -tuning the controller learn the theoretical foundations  of PID controllers . \n20. Cooling  \nThe board does not require active cooling. Aluminum mount is designed to remove heat \nfrom the laser diode.  \n21. Internal protections  \nThe device  provides several security features to ensure the safety of the laser module .  \nThe jumper shunt s the  outputs of driver, to prot ect the laser diode from static discharges \nwhile  installing.  \nBefore installing the laser module  on the board, make sure there is a jumper! Remove the \njumper before turning on the driver.  \nReverse diode protects the l aser diode from reverse current  and reverse  voltage .  \nIn case of an over -current or an over temperature condition, the control logic disables the driver \nand the output shorts  with  2 mOhm  shunt . Setting the current protection threshold is described in \nparagraph 1 8. The current protection  threshold must be less than the laser module absolute \nmaximum ratings .  \nThe TEC current  limit allows setting  the maximum  current  safe for the Peltier module.  \n  \nMaiman Electronics                                     SF8025, SF8075 , SF8150, SF8300  \n17 22.
