**Description:**
The PE-65612NL is a digital audio isolation transformer designed for use in digital audio data transmission systems. It features a 1:1 turns ratio and is optimized for interfacing between line drivers and receivers, particularly in applications that adhere to standards such as AES 3-199X or IEC 958. The transformer helps to improve signal integrity by reducing common mode noise and electromagnetic interference (EMI), making it essential for high-quality audio transmission.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Digital Audio Transmission:** Specifically designed for use with Cirrus Logic's CS8401, CS8402, CS8403, and CS8404 digital audio interface transmit devices.
- **Signal Isolation:** Used in systems where isolation is necessary to prevent noise and interference, ensuring clear audio signals over long distances.
- **Interconnecting Medium:** Suitable for applications that require the transmission of two channels of periodically sampled audio signals over a single shielded twisted pair cable, allowing for extended cable lengths while maintaining signal quality.

This transformer is particularly valuable in professional audio equipment, digital broadcasting, and any application where high fidelity audio transmission is critical.
