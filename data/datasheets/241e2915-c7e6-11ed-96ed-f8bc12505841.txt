Data on \nthe SDA pin may change only during SCL low time periods (refer to Figure 4). Data changes during \nSCL high periods will indicate a start or stop \ncondition as defined below. \nSTART CONDITION: A high-to-low transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a start condition which must \nprecede any other command (refer to Figure 5). \nSTOP CONDITION: A low-to-high transition of SDA \nwith SCL high is a stop condition. After a read \nsequence, the stop command will place the EEPROM \nin a standby power m ode (refer to Figure 5). \nACKNOWLEDGE:  All addresses and data words are \nserially transmitted to and from the EEPROM in 8-bit \nwords. The EEPROM sends a zero to acknowledge \nthat it has received each word. This happens during the ninth clock cycle. Following receipt each \nword from the EEPROM, the microcontroller should send a zero to  EEPROM and continue to output the \nnext data word or send a stop condition to finish the \nread cycle. \nSTANDBY MODE: The FM24C02C features a \nlow-power standby mode which is enabled: (a) upon \npower-up and (b) after the receipt of the stop bit and \nthe completion of any internal operations. \nDEVICE RESET: After an interruption in protocol, \npower loss or system reset, any two-wire part can \nbe reset in following these steps: \n1. Clock up to 9 Cycles, \n2. Look for SDA high in each cycle while SCL is \nhigh and then, \n3. Create a start condition as SDA is high. \n \nBus Timing  \nFigure 2．SCL: Serial Clock, S DA: Serial Data I/O \n \ntSU.STASCL\nSDA\nIN\nSDA OUTt\nAAtHD.STA tHD.DATtLOWtFtHIGH\ntLOW\ntDHtSU.DATtR\ntSU.STO\ntBUF\n \n \n \n \n \n        D a t a  S h e e t  \nFM24C02C  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                       V e r 1 . 6                                      9 Write Cycle Timing  \nFigure 3．SCL: Serial Clock, SDA: Serial Data I/O  \n \n \n \n \nNote: 1.

A read operation is initiated if \nthis bit is high and a write operation is initiated if this bit is low. \nUpon a compare of the device address, the EEPROM \nwill output a zero.    \n  \n \n \n \n        D a t a  S h e e t  \nFM24C02C  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                       V e r 1 . 6                                      11 Write Operations   \nBYTE WRITE: A write operation requires an 8-bit \ndata word address following the device address \nword and acknowledgment. Upon receipt of this address, the EEPROM will again respond with a \nzero and then clock in the first 8-bit data word. \nFollowing receipt of the 8-bit data word, the EEPROM will output a zero and the addressing device, such as a microcontroller, must terminate \nthe write sequence with a stop condition. At this \ntime the EEPROM enters an internally timed write cycle, \ntWR, to the nonvolatile memory. All inputs are \ndisabled during this write cycle and the EEPROM \nwill not respond until the writ e is complete (refer to \nFigure 8). \nPAGE WRITE: The 2K devices are capable of \n8-byte page writes. \nA page write is initiated the same as a byte write, \nbut the microcontroller  does not send a stop \ncondition after the first data word is clocked in. Instead, after the EEPROM acknowledges receipt \nof the first data word, the microcontroller can \ntransmit up to seven more data words. The EEPROM will respond with a zero after each data word received. The microcontroller must terminate the \npage write sequence with a stop condition (refer to \nFigure 9). \nThe data word address lower three bits are internally \nincremented following the receipt of each data word. \nThe higher data word address bits are not \nincremented, retaining the memory page row location. When the word address, internally generated, reaches the page boundary, the \nfollowing byte is placed at the beginning of the \nsame page. If more than eight data words are transmitted to the EEPROM, the data word address will “roll over” and previous data w ill be overwritten. \nACKNOWLEDGE POLLING: Once the internally \ntimed write cycle has started and the EEPROM inputs are disabled, acknowledge polling can be initiated. This involves sending a start condition \nfollowed by the device address word. The \nread/write bit is representative of the operation desired. Only if the internal write cycle has completed will the EEPROM respond with a zero \nallowing the read or write sequence to continue. Read Operations  \nRead operations are initiated the same way as write \noperations with the exception that the read/write select bit in the device ad dress word is  set to one. \nThere are three read operations: current address \nread, random address read and sequential read. \nCURRENT ADDRESS READ: The internal data \nword address counter maintains the last address \naccessed during the last read or write operation, \nincremented by one. This address stays valid \nbetween operations as long as the chip power is maintained. The address “roll over” during read is from the last byte of the last memory page to the \nfirst byte of the first page. The address “roll over” during write is from the last byte of the current page to the first byte of the same page. \nOnce the device address with the read/write select \nbit set to one is clocked in and acknowledged by \nthe EEPROM, the current address data word is serially clocked out. The microcontroller does not respond with an input zero but does generate a \nfollowing stop condition (refer to Figure 10). \nRANDOM READ: A random read requires a “dummy” \nbyte write sequence to load in the data word \naddress. Once the device address word and data \nword address are clocked in and acknowledged by \nthe EEPROM, the microcontroller must generate another start condition. The microcontroller now initiates a current address read by sending a \ndevice address with the read/write select bit high. \nThe EEPROM acknowledges the device address and serially clocks out the data word. The microcontroller does not respond with a zero but \ndoes generate a following stop condition (refer to \nFigure 11). \nSEQUENTIAL READ: Sequential reads are \ninitiated by either a current address read or a \nrandom address read. After the microcontroller \nreceives a data word, it responds with an acknowledge. As long as the EEPROM receives an acknowledge, it will continue to increment the data \nword address and serially clock out sequential data \nwords. When the memory address limit is reached, the data word address will “roll over” and the sequential read will continue. The sequential read \noperation is terminated when the microcontroller \ndoes not respond with a zero but does generate a following stop condition (refer to Figure 12) \n \n \n        D a t a  S h e e t  \nFM24C02C  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                       V e r 1 . 6                                      12  \nFigure 7．Device Address   \n \n \n      M S B                                     L S B  \n1 0 1 0 0 0 0 R/W\n \n \n \n \nFigure 8．Byte Write   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 9．Page Write   \n \n \n \n \n \n        D a t a  S h e e t  \nFM24C02C  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                       V e r 1 . 6                                      13  \nFigure 10 ．Current Address Read   \n \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 11 ． Random Read  \n \n \n \n \n \nFigure 12 ． Sequential Read   \n \n \n \n \n \n        D a t a  S h e e t  \nFM24C02C  2-wrie Serial EEPROM                       V e r 1 . 6                                      14 Ordering Information  \n \nCompany Prefix\nProduct Family\nProduct Density\nPackage Type (1)FM = Shanghai Fudan Microelectronics Group Co.,ltd\n24C = 2-Wire Serial EEPROM\n02 = 2K-bit\nPD = 8-pin PDIP M2F or M2P = 8-pin Module Package     \nSO = 8-pin SOP M3F or M3P = 6-pin Module Package \nTS = 8-pin TSSOP\nDN = 8-pin TDFNST = 5-pin TSOT23FM 24C 02 -PP\nHSF ID Code (2)\nBlank or R = RoHS CompliantG = RoHS Compliant, Halogen-free, Antimony-free-H-C\nProduct Carrier\nU = TubeT = Tape and ReelR = Module ReelC\nSub-Product Family\nC = 1.7V to 5.5V\n \n \nNote:  \n1.
