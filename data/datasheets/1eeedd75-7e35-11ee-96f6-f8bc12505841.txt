The ICP cable  length  must be reduced  at the minimum. The SPI flash  \noutput  buffer  capabili ty (MISO)  is limited  compared  to the programmer  performances.  \nSo even if the programmer  is able  to drive  high capacitance,  the Serial  Flash soldered \non the application will probably  not (information  read from SPI Flash  will be wrong).  \n \nC. Smart management of the SPI Flash Vcc and SPI signals  \nIn order  to minimize the impact of the ICP method  on the chipset and application  \nboard, the programmer  supplies  the application  Serial  Flash with  Vcc and SPI signals  \nonly  during  the programmer and Serial Flash operations.  \nAdvantages:  \na) The programmer is plugged  on the application  board  with  Vcc OFF and SPI \nsignals in  High  Impedance to avoid  inrush  current.  \n \nb) All the ICP pins are protected  with  ESD high  performance protections  to \ndischarge  the Electronics  charge before  the conn ection and protect  the \napplication.  \n                                                                                                          SF100 Serial Flash Programm er \n                                                                                                        \nwww.dediprog.com                                                                                                                                        8 \nc) The Serial  Flash  Vcc and SPI signals are  provided  only  when  the user  send  the \ncommand and are switched OFF automatically when  the operation  is completed. \nTherefore, the programmer  is transparent for the application  and c an be kept  \nconnected  during  application  trials.  \n \nD. High voltage supply: Vpp/Acc  \nSpecification for the Vpp pin  \nVpp = 8.5V to 12 .5V \nIpp max  = 50mA  \nThe Vpp high  voltage  can be supplied  by the programmer  and used to speed up  \nprogramming  and erasing of the appli cation Serial Flash if  this feature  is supported  \nby the Serial Flash supplier.  \nThe Vpp supply  will be applied  automatically  by the programmer  on the Vpp pin \nonly  during erase, write, or programming  operations and only if the Vpp option has \nbeen  enabled on the software.  The programmer  will also control  the Vpp voltage  \nlevel  according  to the Serial Flash  connected and its specification.  \n \nE. I/O management: I /O1, I /O2, I/O3, I /O4 \nFour general outputs are available on the ICP connector for custom needs. The IOs \nare in HZ state if there is no software operation ongoing even if the power is \nconnected. The IOs are driven high or low when the software is running command.   \n \nI/O4 , I/O2 = driven High  \nI/O1 , I/O3 = driven Low  \n \nThese outputs can be useful to drive Wp, Hold, reset the application chipset, or \nswitch Off the MOSFET transistors in the application board. They are CMOS \ncompatible and are switched in High Impedance when the software is not executing \ncommands.  \n \nThe I/O2  can also be used as a s econd Chip Select  to upd ate a second SPI Flash \nsoldered on the board. In this case, I/O2 have to be connected to the application \nCS2 and the option “Chip 2” has to be selected in the DediProg software.  \nFor the DC characteristics please refer to table 3.  \nESD high performance prote ction  compliant with IEC61000 -4-2 level 4:  \n15kV (air discharge)  \n8kV( contact discharge)  \n \n \n \n                                                                                                          SF100 Serial Flash Programm er \n                                                                                                        \nwww.dediprog.com                                                                                                                                        9 \n3.2.2 ICP timing  \nThe IO has been designed to set the application in external programming mode before \napplying the SPI signal. They can be used to reset the chipset a nd application, to drive \nmultiplexers and switch SPI bus from application controller to programmer, to turn off \nMOSFET and isolate the SPI bus when programmer is working.  \nThis is the behavior of the IO and SPI signals on our latest firmware .  \n \nA. If No progra mmer operation is on going  \nAll our SF 100 outputs are equivalent  to high  impedance.  \n \nB. When an operation is requested on the user interface  \n-  I/O1, I /O2, I /O3 and I /O4 are first switched in Low impedance  \n-  I/O1 and I /O3 are driven low  \n-  I/O2 and I /O4 are driven high  \n \nC. 3ms after IO are switched to Low Impedance, the CS, Clock and MOSI outputs are \nswitched in low impedance too. CS1 and CS2 are driven high  \n- CS is driven high  \n- Clock and MOSI are driven low.  \n \nD. The programmer is then ready for the communication with the Ser ial Flash.  \nSo designer can use I /O3 to reset or switch the application in external programming \nmode.
