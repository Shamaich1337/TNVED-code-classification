This performance is possible while consuming less than 4.0 mW of power from a single 5 V supply. These features increase the operation time of high speed, battery-powered \nsystems without compromising dynamic performance. \nThe products have true single-supply capability with rail-to-rail \ninput and output characteristics and are specified for +2.7 V , +5 V , \nand ±5 V supplies. The input voltage range can extend to 500 mV beyond each rail. The output voltage swings to within 20 mV of each rail providing the maximum output dynamic range. \nThe AD8031 /AD8032 also offer excellent signal quality for only \n800 μA of supply current per amplifier; THD is −62 dBc with a \n2 V p-p, 1 MHz output signal, and –86 dBc for a 100 kHz, \n4.6 V p-p signal on +5 V supply. The low distortion and fast \nsettling time make them ideal as buffers to single-supply ADCs.

This is a stress \nrating only; functional operation of the device at these or any other conditions above those indicated in the operational section of this specification is not implied. Exposure to absolute maximum rating conditions for extended periods may affect device reliability.  \n MAXIMUM  POWER  DISSIPATION  \nThe maximum power that can be safely dissipated by the \nAD8031/ AD8032 is limited by the associated rise in junction \ntemperature. The maximum safe junction temperature for \nplastic encapsulated devices is determined by the glass \ntransition temperature of the plastic, approximately 150 °C. \nExceeding this limit temporarily can  cause a shift in parametric \nperformance due to a change in the stresses exerted on the die by the package.  Excee ding a junction temperature of 175°C for \nan extended period can result in device failure.  \nWhile the AD8031/ AD8032 are internally short -circuit \nprotected, this may not be sufficient to guarantee that the \nmaximum junction temperature ( 150°C) is not exceeded  under \nall conditions. To ensure proper operation, it is necessary to observe the maximum power derati ng curves shown in Figure 7. \n2.0\n1.5\n0MAXIMUM POWER DISSIPATION (W)1.0\n0.5 5-LEAD SOT-23TJ = +150°C\n8-LEAD PDIP\n8-LEAD SOIC\nAMBIENT TEMPERATURE (°C)8-LEAD MSOP\n–50 –40 –30 –20 –10 010 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90\n01056-007 \nFigure 7.

G | Page 13 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8031/ AD8032 are single and dual versions of high \nspeed, low power , voltage feedback amplifiers featuring an \ninnovative architecture th at maximizes the dynamic range \ncapability on the inputs and outputs. The l inear input common -\nmode range exceeds either supply voltage by 200 mV , and the \namplifiers show no phase reversal up to 500 mV beyond supply. The output swings to within 20 mV of either supply when driving a light load; 300 mV when driving up to 5 mA.  \nFabricated on Analog Devices , Inc.  eXtra Fast Complementary \nBipolar (XFCB) process,  the amplifier provides an impressive \n80 MHz bandwidth when used as a follower and a 30 V/µs slew \nrate at only 800 µA supply current. Careful design allows the \namplifier to operate with a supply voltage as low as 2.7 V .  \nINPUT STAGE OPERATIO N \nA simplified schematic of the input stage appears in Figure 43. \nFor common -mode voltages u p to 1.1 V  within the positive \nsupply (0 V to 3.9 V on a single 5 V supply) , tail current I2 \nflows through the PNP differential pair, Q13 and Q17. Q5 is cut off; no bias current is routed to the parallel NPN differential pair, Q2 and Q3. As the common -mode  voltage is driven within \n1.1 V of the positive supply, Q5 turns on and routes the tail \ncurrent away from the PNP pair and to the NPN pair. During \nthis transition region, the input current of the amplifier change s \nmagnitude and direction. Reusing the same tail current ensures \nthat the input stage has the same transconductance , which \ndetermines the gain and bandwidth  of the amplifier,  in both \nregions of operation.  Switching to the NPN pair as the common -mode voltage is \ndriven beyond 1 V within the positive supply allows the amplifier \nto provide useful operation for signals at either end of the \nsupply voltage range and eliminates the possibility of phase \nreversal for input signals up to 500 mV beyond either power \nsupply. Offset voltage also change s to reflect  the offset of the \ninput pair in control. The transition region is small, approximately 180 mV . These sudden changes in the dc parameters of the input stage can produce glitches that adversely affect distortion.   \nOVERDRIVING THE INPU T STAGE  \nSustained input  differential voltages greater than 3.4 V  should \nbe avoided as the input transistors can  be damaged. Input clamp \ndiodes are recommended if the possibility of this condition exists. \nThe voltages at the collectors of the input pairs are set to \n200 mV from th e power supply rails. This allows the amplifier \nto remain in linear operation for input voltages up to 500 mV beyond the supply voltages. Driving the input common -mode \nvoltage beyond that point will forward bias the collector junction  of \nthe input transist or, resulting in phase reversal. Sustaining this \ncondition for any length of time should be avoided because  it is \neasy to exceed the maximum allowed input differential voltage when the amplifier is in phase reversal.  \nQ3 Q2\nQ13 Q17Q6\nQ8Q10\n4\nQ14\n41 1\nQ7\nQ151Q11\n4\n14\nQ16\nQ18 Q4VCC\nVIN\nVIPQ5Q9\nVEEOUTPUTSTAGE,\nCOMMON-MODE\nFEEDBAC K\nR4\n2kΩR2\n2kΩR1\n2kΩI3\n25µA\nI4\n25µA\nR3\n2kΩ I1\n5µAI2\n90µA\n1.1V\nR5\n50kΩR6\n850ΩR7\n850ΩR8\n850ΩR9\n850Ω\n01056-043 \nFigure 43.

Output Stage Simplified Schematic \nThe output voltage limit depends on how much current the \noutput transistors are required to source or sink. For appl ications  \nwith low drive requirements ( for instance, a unity gain follower \ndriving another amplifier input), the AD8031 typically sw ings \nwithin 20 mV of either voltage supply. As the required current load increases, the saturation output voltage increase s linearly as  \nI\nLOAD × RC  \nwhere:  \nILOAD is the required load current . \nRC is the output transistor collector resistance.  \nFor the AD8031, the collector resistances for both output \ntransistors are typically 25 Ω. As the current load exceeds the \nrated output current of 15 mA, the amount of base drive current \nrequired to drive the output transistor into saturation reach es its \nlimit, and the a mplifier’s output swing rapidly decrease s. The open -loop gain of the AD8031 decreases approximately \nlinearly with load resistance and  depends on the output voltage. \nOpen -loop gain stays constant to within 250 mV of the positive \npower supply, 150 mV of the negative power supply , and then \ndecreases as the output transistors are driven further into saturation.  \nThe distortion performance  of the AD8031/ AD8032 amplifiers \ndiffers from conventional amplifiers. Typically , the distortion \nperformance of the amplifier degrades as the output voltage \namplitude increases.  \nUsed as a unity gain follower, the output of the AD8031/ \nAD8032 exhibit s more distortion i n the peak output voltage \nregion around V\nCC − 0.7 V . This unusual distortion characteristic  is \ncaused by the input stage architecture and is discussed in detail \nin the Input Stage Operation  section,  \nOUTPUT OVERDRIVE REC OVERY  \nOutput overdrive of an amplifier occurs when the  amplifier \nattempts to drive the output voltage to a level outside its normal range. After the overdrive condition is removed, the amplifier must recover to normal operation in a reasonable amount of time. As shown in Figure 45, the AD8031/ AD8032 recover \nwithin 100 ns from negative overdrive and within 80 ns from positive overdrive.  \nRL\n50ΩVINVOUT\n100ns 1VVS=±2.5V\nVIN=±2.5V\nRL=1kΩTO GNDRF=RG=2kΩRG RF\n01056-045 \nFigure 45.

G | Page 15 of 20 DRIVING CAPACITIVE L OADS  \nCapacitive loads interact with an op amp’s output impedance to \ncreate an extra delay in the feedback path. This reduces circuit \nstability and can cause unwanted ringing and oscillation. A \ngiven value of capacitance causes much less ringing when the amplifier is used with a higher noise gain.  \nThe capacitive load drive of the AD8031/ AD80 32 can be \nincreased by adding a low valued resistor in series with the capacitive load. Introducing a series resistor tends to isolate the capacitive load from the feedback loop, thereby diminishing its influence. Figure 46 shows the effects of a series resistor on the \ncapacitive drive for varying voltage gains. As the closed -loop \ngain is increased, the larger phase margin allows for larger capacitive loads with less overshoot. Adding a series resistor at lower closed -loop gains accomplishes the same effect. For large \ncapacitive loads, the frequency response of the amplifier is domin ated by the roll -off of the series resistor and capacitive load.  1000\n10100CAPACITIVE LOAD (pF)\nCLOSED-LOOP GAIN(V/V)1\n0 1 2 3 4 5RS=5Ω\nRS=0Ω\nRS=20Ω\nRS=20Ω\nRS=0Ω,5ΩVS=5V\n200m VSTEP\nWITH30% OVERSHOOT\nRG RF\nRS\nCLVOUT\n01056-046 \nFigure 46.

G | Page 16 of 20 APPLICATIONS \nA 2 MHz  SINGLE -SUPPLY,  BIQUAD BAND -PASS \nFILTER  \nFigure 47 shows a circuit for a single -supply , biquad band -pass \nfilter with a center frequency of 2 MHz. A 2.5 V bias level is \neasily created by connecting the noninvert ing inputs of all three \nop amps to a resistor divider consisting of two 1 kΩ resistors \nconnected between 5 V and ground. This bias point is also decoupled to ground with a 0.1 µF capacitor. The frequency \nresponse of the filter is shown in Figure 48. \nTo maintain an accurate center frequency, it is essential that the \nop amp have  sufficient loop gain at 2 MHz. This requires the \nchoice of an op amp with a significantly higher unity gain , \ncrossover frequency. The unity gain , crossover frequency of the \nAD8031/ AD8032 is 40 MHz. Multiplying the open -loop gain by \nthe feedback factors of the individual op amp circuits yields the loop gain for each gain stage. From the feedback networks of \nthe individua l op amp circuits, it  can be seen  that each op amp \nhas a loop gain of at least 21 dB. This level is high enough to \nensure that the center frequency of the filter is not affected by \nthe op amp’s bandwidth. If, for example, an op amp with a gain \nbandwidth pr oduct of 10 MHz was chosen in this application, \nthe resulting center frequency would shift by 20% to 1.6 MHz.  \n5V\n0.1µF0.1µF\n1kΩ1kΩ\nAD80315V\nVOUTC2\n50pFC1\n50pFR6\n1kΩ\nR4\n2kΩ\n1/2\nAD80321/2\nAD8032R5\n2kΩR1\n3kΩVINR2\n2kΩ\nR3\n2kΩ0.1µF\n01056-047 \nFigure 47.

With the outpu t driving a back -terminated \n50 Ω line, the overall gain from V IN to V OUT is unity. In ad dition \nto minimizing reflections, the 50 Ω  back termination resistor \nprotects the transistor from damage if the cable is short circuited. The emitter follower, which is inside the feedback loop, ensures that the output voltage from the AD8031 stays about 700 mV \nabove ground. Using this circuit, low distortion is attainable even when the output signal swings to within 50  mV of ground. \nThe circuit was tested at 500 kHz and 2 MHz.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD8031/AD8032  \n \nRev.

THD of Low Distortion Line Driver at 500 k Hz \nFigure 52 and Figure 53 show the output signal swing and \nfrequency spectrum at 2 MHz. As expected, there is some degradation in signal quality at the higher frequency. When the output signal has a pe ak-to-peak swing of 1.45 V (sw inging \nfrom 50 mV to 1.5 V), the THD is −55 dB (SFDR = −60 dB).  This circuit could also be used to drive the analog input of a single -supply , high speed ADC whose input voltage range is \nreferenced to ground ( for example , 0 V to 2 V or 0 V to 4 V). In \nthis case, a back termination resistor is not necessary (assuming \na short physical distance from transistor to ADC) ; therefore,  the \nemitter of the external transistor would be connected directly to the ADC input. The available output voltage swing of the circu it \nwould therefore be doubled.  \n50mV10\n0%100\n901.5V\n0.2V 200ns\n01056-052 \nFigure 52.
