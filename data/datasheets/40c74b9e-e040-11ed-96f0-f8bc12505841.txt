This inverting schemeis ideal for generating a negative rail in single power supply\nsystems. Only two small external capacitors are needed for the\ncharge pump. Output currents up to 50 mA with greater than90% efficiency are achievable, while 100 mA achieves greater\nthan 80% efficiency.\nA Frequency Control (FC) input pin is used to select either\n25 kHz or 120 kHz charge-pump operation. This is used tooptimize capacitor size and quiescent current. With 25 kHz\nselected, a 10 µF external capacitor is suitable, while with 120 kHz\nthe capacitor may be reduced to 2.2 µF. The oscillator frequency\non the ADM660 can also be controlled with an external capacitor\nconnected to the OSC input or by driving this input with anexternal clock. In applications where a higher supply voltage isdesired it is possible to use the ADM660 to double the input\nvoltage. With input voltages from 2.5 V to 7 V, output voltages\nfrom 5 V to 14 V are achievable with up to 100 mA output current.\nThe ADM8660 features a low power shutdown (SD) pin instead\nof the external oscillator (OSC) pin. This can be used to disablethe device and reduce the quiescent current to 300 nA.The ADM660 is a pin compatible upgrade for the MAX660,MAX665, ICL7660, and LTC1046.\nThe ADM660/ADM8660 is available in 8-lead DIP and\nnarrow- body SOIC.

Output Resistance vs. Temperature\nGENERAL INFORMATION\nThe ADM660/ADM8660 is a switched capacitor voltage con-\nverter that can be used to invert the input supply voltage. TheADM660 can also be used in a voltage doubling mode. The\nvoltage conversion task is achieved using a switched capacitor\ntechnique using two external charge storage capacitors. An on-board oscillator and switching network transfers charge between\nthe charge storage capacitors. The basic principle behind thevoltage conversion scheme is illustrated in Figures 1 and 2.\n+\n+V+S1\nS2S3S4CAP+\nCAP–C1\nC2OUT = –V+\nΦ1 Φ2 + 2\nOSCILLATOR\nFigure 1. Voltage Inversion Principle\n+ +V+S1S2S3S4CAP+\nCAP–C1 C2V\nOUT = 2V+\nΦ1 Φ2 + 2\nOSCILLATORV+\nFigure 2. Voltage Doubling Principle\nFigure 1 shows the voltage inverting configuration, while Figure 2\nshows the configuration for voltage doubling. An oscillator\ngenerating antiphase signals φ1 and φ2 controls switches S1, S2,\nand S3, S4. During φ1, switches S1 and S2 are closed charging\nC1 up to the voltage at V+. During φ2, S1 and S2 open and S3\nand S4 close. With the voltage inverter configuration during φ2,\nthe positive terminal of C1 is connected to GND via S3 and the\nnegative terminal of C1 connects to V OUT via S4. The net result\nis voltage inversion at V OUT wrt GND. Charge on C1 is trans-\nferred to C2 during φ2. Capacitor C2 maintains this voltage\nduring φ1. The charge transfer efficiency depends on the on-\nresistance of the switches, the frequency at which they are being\nswitched, and also on the equivalent series resistance (ESR) of\nthe external capacitors. The reason for this is explained in the\nfollowing section. For maximum efficiency, capacitors with lowESR are, therefore, recommended.\nThe voltage doubling configuration reverses some of the con-\nnections, but the same principle applies.Switched Capacitor Theory of Operation\nAs already described, the charge pump on the ADM660/ADM8660\nuses a switched capacitor technique in order to invert or double\nthe input supply voltage. Basic switched capacitor theory is\ndiscussed below.\nA switched capacitor building block is illustrated in Figure 3.\nWith the switch in position A, capacitor C1 will charge to voltage\nV1. The total charge stored on C1 is q1 = C1V1. The switch isthen flipped to position B discharging C1 to voltage V2. Thecharge remaining on C1 is q2 = C1V2. The charge transferredto the output V2 is, therefore, the difference between q1 and\nq2, so ∆q = q1–q2 = C1 (V1–V2).\nV1AB\nC1C2 RLV2\nFigure 3. Switched Capacitor Building Block\nAs the switch is toggled between A and B at a frequency f, thecharge transfer per unit time or current is:\n    I=f(∆q)=f(C1)(V1–V2)\nTherefore,\n    I=(V1–V2)/(1/ fC1)=(V1–V2)/(REQ)\nwhere REQ = 1/fC1\nThe switched capacitor may, therefore, be replaced by an equivalent\nresistance whose value is dependent on both the capacitor size\nand the switching frequency. This explains why lower capacitor\nvalues may be used with higher switching frequencies. It should\nbe remembered that as the switching frequency is increased thepower consumption will increase due to some charge being lost\nat each switching cycle. As a result, at high frequencies, the power\nefficiency starts decreasing. Other losses include the resistance\nof the internal switches and the equivalent series resistance (ESR)\nof the charge storage capacitors.\nV1REQ\nREQ = 1/fC1V2\nC2 RL\nFigure 4.

As in the inverting mode, only two external\ncapacitors are required. The doubling function is achieved byreversing some connections to the device. The input voltage is\napplied to the GND pin and V+ is used as the output. Input\nvoltages from 2.5 V to 7 V are allowable. In this configuration,pins LV, OUT must be connected to GND.\nThe unloaded output voltage in this configuration is 2 (V\nIN).\nOutput resistance and ripple are similar to the voltage inverting\nconfiguration.\nNote that the ADM8660 cannot be used in the voltage\ndoubling configuration.\n+\n10/H9262FDOUBLED\nPOSITIVEOUTPUT ADM660FC\nCAP+\nGND\nCAP–V+\nOSC\nLV\nOUT\n+\n10/H9262F\n+2.5V\nTO +7V\nINPUT\nFigure 8. Voltage Doubler Configuration\nShutdown Input\nThe ADM8660 contains a shutdown input that can be used to\ndisable the device and thus reduce the power consumption. Alogic high level on the SD input shuts the device down reducing\nthe quiescent current to 0.3 µA. During shutdown, the output\nvoltage goes to 0 V. Therefore, ground referenced loads are not\npowered during this state. When exiting shutdown, it takes\nseveral cycles (approximately 500 µs) for the charge pump to\nreach its final value. If the shutdown function is not being used,\nthen SD should be hardwired to GND.\nCapacitor Selection\nThe optimum capacitor value selection depends the charge-pump\nfrequency. With 25 kHz selected, 10 µF capacitors are recommended,\nwhile with 120 kHz selected, 2.2 µF capacitors may be used.\nOther frequencies allow other capacitor values to be used. Formaximum efficiency in all cases, it is recommended that capaci-tors with low ESR are used for the charge-pump. Low ESR\ncapacitors give both the lowest output resistance and \nlowest\nripple voltage. High output resistance degrades the overall  power\nefficiency and causes voltage drops, especially at high outputInverting Negative Voltage Generator\nFigures 5 and 6 show the ADM660/ADM8660 configured to\ngenerate a negative output voltage. Input supply voltages from\n1.5 V up to 7 V are allowable. For supply voltage less than 3 V,\nLV must be connected to GND. This bypasses the internalregulator circuitry and gives best performance in low voltage\napplications. With supply voltages greater than 3 V, LV may\nbe either connected to GND or left open. Leaving it open facili-tates direct substitution for the ICL7660.\n+\n++1.5V TO +7V\nINPUT\nC1\n10/H9262F\nC2\n10/H9262FINVERTEDNEGATIVEOUTPUTADM660FC\nCAP+\nGND\nCAP–V+\nOSC\nLV\nOUT\nFigure 5.

ADM8660 Voltage Inverter Configuration\nOSCILLATOR FREQUENCY\nThe internal charge-pump frequency may be selected to be\neither 25 kHz or 120 kHz using the Frequency Control (FC)input. With FC unconnected (ADM660) or connected to GND\n(ADM8660), the internal charge pump runs at 25 kHz while, if\nFC is connected to V+, the frequency is increased by a factor offive. Increasing the frequency allows smaller capacitors to be\nused for equivalent performance or, if the capacitor size is un-\nchanged, it results in lower output impedance and ripple.\nIf a charge-pump frequency other than the two fixed values is\ndesired, this is made possible by the OSC input, which can\neither have a capacitor connected to it or be overdriven by an\nexternal clock. Refer to the Typical Performance Characteris-tics, which shows the variation in charge-pump frequency versus\ncapacitor size. The charge-pump frequency is one-half the oscil-\nlator frequency applied to the OSC pin.\nIf an external clock is used to overdrive the oscillator, its levels\nshould swing to within 100 mV of V+ and GND. A CMOS\ndriver is, therefore, suitable. When OSC is overdriven, FC has\nno effect but LV must be grounded.\nNote that overdriving is permitted only in the voltage inverter\nconfiguration.\nTable I.

ADM660/ADM8660\n–9–current levels. The ADM660/ADM8660 is tested using low\nESR, 10 µF, capacitors for both C1 and C2. Smaller values of\nC1 increase the output resistance, while increasing C1 will\nreduce the output resistance. The output resistance is also depen-\ndent on the internal switches on resistance as well as thecapacitors ESR, so the effect of increasing C1 becomes negligible\npast a certain point.\nFigure 9 shows how the output resistance varies with oscillator\nfrequency for three different capacitor values. At low oscillatorfrequencies, the output impedance is dominated by the 1/f\nC\nterm. This explains why the output impedance is higher forsmaller capacitance values. At high oscillator frequencies, the1/f\nC term becomes insignificant and the output impedance is\ndominated by the internal switches on resistance. From an out-put impedance viewpoint, therefore, there is no benefit to begained from using excessively large capacitors.\nOSCILLATOR FREQUENCY – kHz500\n400\n0\n0.1 100 11 0300\n200\n100C1 = C2 = 2.2/H9262F\nC1 = C2 = 1/H9262F\nC1 = C2 = 10/H9262FOUTPUT RESISTANCE – /H9024\nFigure 9. Output Impedance vs. Oscillator FrequencyCapacitor C2\nThe output capacitor size C2 affects the output ripple. Increas-\ning the capacitor size reduces the peak-to-peak ripple. The ESRaffects both the output impedance and the output ripple.\nReducing the ESR reduces the output impedance and ripple.\nFor convenience it is recommended that both C1 and C2 be the\nsame value.\nTable III.

As the\noscillator frequency is increased, the quiescent current increases.\nThis happens as a result of a finite charge being lost at eachswitching cycle. The charge loss per unit cycle at very high\nfrequencies can be significant, thereby reducing the power effi-\nciency. Since the power efficiency is also degraded at low oscillator\nfrequencies due to an increase in output impedance, this meansthat there is an optimum frequency band for maximum power\ntransfer. Refer to the Typical Performance Characteristics section.\nBypass Capacitor\nThe ac impedance of the ADM660/ADM8660 may be reducedby using a bypass capacitor on the input supply. This capacitor\nshould be connected between the input supply and GND. Itwill provide instantaneous current surges as required.

#### Description:
The ADM660ARZ is a CMOS switched-capacitor voltage converter designed to either invert the input supply voltage or double it (ADM660 variant). It operates with input voltages ranging from +1.5 V to +7 V, making it suitable for generating negative voltage rails in single-supply systems. The device requires only two external capacitors for operation, which simplifies the design and reduces component count.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Handheld Instruments:** Provides necessary negative voltage rails for operational amplifiers and other analog circuits.
- **Portable Computers:** Used in power management circuits to generate required voltage levels.
- **Remote Data Acquisition:** Supplies stable voltage levels for sensors and data acquisition systems.
- **Operational Amplifier Power Supplies:** Ideal for applications requiring dual supply voltages from a single supply.

The ADM660ARZ is particularly useful in applications where space and power efficiency are critical, as it allows for the generation of negative voltages without the need for bulky transformers or additional power supplies.
