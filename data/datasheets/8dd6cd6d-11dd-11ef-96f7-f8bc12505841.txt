The devices operate with a single +5V supply ordual ±5V supplies. The analog inputs are software con-figurable for unipolar/bipolar and single-ended/differen-tial operation.\nThe 4-wire serial interface directly connects to SPI,\nQSPI™ and MICROWIRE ®devices without external\nlogic. A serial strobe output allows direct connection toTMS320 family digital signal processors. TheMAX186/MAX188 use either the internal clock or anexternal serial-interface clock to perform successive-approximation A/D conversions. The serial interface canoperate beyond 4MHz when the internal clock is used.\nThe MAX186 has an internal 4.096V reference while the\nMAX188 requires an external reference. Both parts havea reference-buffer amplifier that simplifies gain trim .\nThe MAX186/MAX188 provide a hard-wired SHDN pin\nand two software-selectable power-down modes.\nAccessing the serial interface automatically powers upthe devices, and the quick turn-on time allows theMAX186/MAX188 to be shut down between every con-version. Using this technique of powering downbetween conversions, supply current can be cut tounder 10µA at reduced sampling rates.\nThe MAX186/MAX188 are available in 20-pin PDIP and\nSO packages, and in a shrink small-outline package(SSOP), that occupies 30% less area than an 8-pinPDIP. For applications that call for a parallel interface,see the MAX180/MAX181 data sheet. For anti-aliasingfilters, consult the MAX274/MAX275 data sheet.\n________________________Applications\nPortable Data Logging\nData-Acquisition High-Accuracy Process ControlAutomatic TestingRoboticsBattery-Powered InstrumentsMedical Instruments____________________________Features\no8-Channel Single-Ended or 4-Channel \nDifferential Inputs\noSingle +5V or ±5V Operation\noLow Power: 1.5mA (Operating Mode)\n2µA (Power-Down Mode)\noInternal Track/Hold, 133kHz Sampling Rate\noInternal 4.096V Reference (MAX186)\noSPI-/QSPI-/MICROWIRE-/TMS320-Compatible 4-Wire Serial Interface\noSoftware-Configurable Unipolar or Bipolar Inputs\no20-Pin PDIP, SO, SSOP Packages\noEvaluation Kit Available\nOrdering Information\n20\n19\n18\n17\n16\n1514\n13\n12111\n2\n3456\n7\n8\n9\n10TOP VIEW\nPDIP/SO/SSOPVDD\nSCLK\nCS\nDIN\nSSTRB\nDOUTDGND\nAGND\nREFADJ\nVREF SHDNV\nSSCH7CH6CH5CH4CH3CH2CH1CH0\nMAX186\nMAX188+____________________ Pin Configuration\nQSPI is a trademark of Motorola.\nMICROWIRE is a registered trademark of National\nSemiconductor.\n19-0123; Rev 5; 1/12Ordering Information continued on last page.\n†Parts are offered in grades A, B, C and D (grades defined in\nElectrical Characteristics).

No external hold capacitors arerequired. Figure 3 shows the block diagram for theMAX186/MAX188.\nPseudo-Differential Input\nThe sampling architecture of the ADC’s analog com-parator is illustrated in the Equivalent Input Circuit(Figure 4). In single-ended mode, IN+ is internallyswitched to CH0-CH7 and IN- is switched to AGND. Indifferential mode, IN+ and IN- are selected from pairsof CH0/CH1, CH2/CH3, CH4/CH5 and CH6/CH7.Configure the channels with Table 3 and Table 4. \nIn differential mode, IN- and IN+ are internally switched\nto either one of the analog inputs. This configuration ispseudo-differential to the effect that only the signal atIN+ is sampled. The return side (IN-) must remain sta-ble within ±0.5LSB (±0.1LSB for best results) withrespect to AGND during a conversion. Accomplish thisby connecting a 0.1µF capacitor from AIN- (the select-ed analog input, respectively) to AGND.\nDuring the acquisition interval, the channel selected as\nthe positive input (IN+) charges capacitor C\nHOLD . The\nacquisition interval spans three SCLK cycles and endson the falling SCLK edge after the last bit of the inputcontrol word has been entered. At the end of the acqui-sition interval, the T/H switch opens, retaining chargeon C\nHOLD as a sample of the signal at IN+. \nThe conversion interval begins with the input multiplex-er switching C\nHOLD from the positive input (IN+) to the\nnegative input (IN-). In single-ended mode, IN- is sim-ply AGND. This unbalances node ZERO at the input ofthe comparator. The capacitive DAC adjusts during theremainder of the conversion cycle to restore nodeZERO to 0V within the limits of 12-bit resolution. Thisaction is equivalent to transferring a charge of 16pF x[(V\nIN+) - (V IN-)] from C HOLD to the binary-weighted\ncapacitive DAC, which in turn forms a digital represen-tation of the analog input signal. \nTrack/Hold\nThe T/H enters its tracking mode on the falling clockedge after the fifth bit of the 8-bit control word has beenshifted in. The T/H enters its hold mode on the fallingclock edge after the eighth bit of the control word hasbeen shifted in. If the converter is set up forsingle-ended inputs, IN- is connected to AGND, andthe converter samples the “+” input. If the converter isset up for differential inputs, IN- connects to the “-”input, and the difference of \n|IN+ - IN- |is sampled. At\nthe end of the conversion, the positive input connectsback to IN+, and C\nHOLD charges to the input signal.\nThe time required for the T/H to acquire an input signalis a function of how quickly its input capacitance ischarged. If the input signal’s source impedance is high,the acquisition time lengthens and more time must beallowed between conversions. Acquisition time is cal-culated by:\nt\nAZ= 9 x (R S+ RIN) x 16pF, \nwhere R IN= 5kΩ , RS= the source impedance of the\ninput signal, and t AZis never less than 1.5µs. Note that\nsource impedances below 5kΩ do not significantly\naffect the AC performance of the ADC. Higher sourceimpedances can be used if an input capacitor is con-nected to the analog inputs, as shown in Figure 5. Notethat the input capacitor forms an RC filter with the inputsource impedance, limiting the ADC’s signal bandwidth.\nInput Bandwidth\nThe ADC’s input tracking circuitry has a 4.5MHzsmall-signal bandwidth, so it is possible to digitizehigh-speed transient events and measure periodic sig-nals with bandwidths exceeding the ADC’s samplingrate by using undersampling techniques. To avoidhigh-frequency signals being aliased into the frequencyband of interest, anti-alias filtering is recommended.Low-Power, 8-Channel,\nSerial 12-Bit ADCs\n8 Maxim IntegratedMAX186/MAX188\nCH0\nCH1\nCH2\nCH3\nCH4CH5\nCH6\nCH7\nAGNDC\nSWITCH\nTRACK\nT/H\nSWITCH10kΩ\nRSCHOLD\nHOLD12-BIT CAPACITIVE DAC\nVREF\nZEROCOMPARATOR\n– +\n16pF\nSINGLE-ENDED MODE:  IN+ = CHO-CH7, IN– = AGND.DIFFERENTIAL MODE:    IN+ AND IN– SELECTED FROM PAIRS OF                                        CH0/CH1, CH2/CH3, CH4/CH5, CH6/CH7.AT THE SAMPLING INSTANT,THE MUX INPUT SWITCHES FROM THE SELECTED IN+ CHANNEL TO THE SELECTED IN– CHANNEL.INPUT\nMUX\nFigure 4. Equivalent Input Circuit\nFull ScaleVREFADJ x A*Analog Input Range and Input Protection\nInternal protection diodes, which clamp the analog\ninput to V DDand V SS, allow the channel input pins to\nswing from V SS- 0.3V to V DD+ 0.3V without damage.\nHowever, for accurate conversions near full scale, theinputs must not exceed V\nDDby more than 50mV, or be\nlower than V SSby 50mV.\nIf the analog input exceeds 50mV beyond the sup-plies, do not forward bias the protection diodes ofoff-channels over two milliamperes, as excessivecurrent will degrade the conversion accuracy of theon-channel.\nThe full-scale input voltage depends on the voltage at\nVREF. See Tables 1a and 1b.\nQuick Look\nTo evaluate the analog performance of theMAX186/MAX188 quickly, use the circuit of Figure 5.The MAX186/MAX188 require a control byte to be writ-ten to DIN before each conversion.

In external clock mode, the SSTRB output pulseshigh for one clock period before the most significant bitof the 12-bit conversion result comes out of DOUT.Varying the analog input to CH7 should alter thesequence of bits from DOUT. A total of 15 clock cyclesis required per conversion. All transitions of the SSTRBand DOUT outputs occur on the falling edge of SCLK.\nHow to Start a Conversion\nA conversion is started on the MAX186/MAX188 by\nclocking a control byte into DIN. Each rising edge onSCLK, with CS low, clocks a bit from DIN into the\nMAX186/MAX188’s internal shift register. After CSfalls,\nthe first arriving logic “1” bit defines the MSB of thecontrol byte. Until this first “start” bit arrives, any num-ber of logic “0” bits can be clocked into DIN with noeffect. Table 2 shows the control-byte format.The MAX186/MAX188 are fully compatible with\nMicrowire and SPI devices. For SPI, select the correctclock polarity and sampling edge in the SPI control reg-isters: set CPOL = 0 and CPHA = 0. Microwire and SPIboth transmit a byte and receive a byte at the sametime. Using the \nTypical Operating Circuit , the simplest\nsoftware interface requires only three 8-bit transfers toperform a conversion (one 8-bit transfer to configurethe ADC, and two more 8-bit transfers to clock out the12-bit conversion result).\nExample:  Simple Software Interface\nMake sure the CPU’s serial interface runs in mastermode so the CPU generates the serial clock. Choose aclock frequency from 100kHz to 2MHz.\n1) Set up the control byte for external clock mode, call\nit TB1. TB1 should be of the format:  1XXXXX11Binary, where the Xs denote the particular channeland conversion-mode selected.Low-Power, 8-Channel,\nSerial 12-Bit ADCs\n10 Maxim IntegratedMAX186/MAX188\nBit 7 Bit 6 Bit 5 Bit 4 Bit 3 Bit 2 Bit 1 Bit 0\n(MSB) (LSB)\nSTART SEL2 SEL1 SEL0 UNI/ BIP SGL/DIF PD1 PD0\nBit Name Description\n7(MSB) START The first logic “ 1” bit after CSgoes low defines the beginning of the control byte.\n6 SEL2 These three bits select which of the eight channels are used for the conversion.\n5 SEL1 See Tables 3 and 4.\n4 SEL0\n3 UNI/BIP 1= unipolar, 0 = bipolar.

In unipolar     \nmode, an analog input signal from 0V to VREF can be converted; in bipolar mode, the\nsignal can range from -VREF/2 to +VREF/2. \n2 SGL/DIF 1= single ended, 0 = differential. Selects single-ended or differential conversions. In\nsingle-ended mode, input signal voltages are referred to AGND. In differential mode,\nthe voltage difference between two channels is measured.

Bytes RB2\nand RB3 will contain the result of the conversionpadded with one leading zero and three trailing zeros.The total conversion time is a function of the serialclock frequency and the amount of dead time between8-bit transfers. Make sure that the total conversion timedoes not exceed 120µs, to avoid excessive T/H droop.\nDigital Output\nIn unipolar input mode, the output is straight binary(see Figure 15). For bipolar inputs, the output istwos-complement (see Figure 16). Data is clocked outat the falling edge of SCLK in MSB-first format.Low-Power, 8-Channel,\nSerial 12-Bit ADCs\nMaxim Integrated 11MAX186/MAX188\nSEL2 SEL1 SEL0 CH0 CH1 CH2 CH3 CH4 CH5 CH6 CH7 AGND\n00 0 + –\n10 0 + –\n00 1 + –\n10 1 + –\n01 0 + –\n11 0 + –\n01 1 + –\n11 1 +  –Table 3.

Channel Selection in Differential Mode (SGL/ DDIIFFFF= 0) \nInternal and External Clock Modes\nThe MAX186/MAX188 may use either an external serial\nclock or the internal clock to perform thesuccessive-approximation conversion. In both clockmodes, the external clock shifts data in and out of theMAX186/MAX188. The T/H acquires the input signal asthe last three bits of the control byte are clocked intoDIN. Bits PD1 and PD0 of the control byte program theclock mode. Figures 7 through 10 show the timingcharacteristics common to both modes.\nExternal Clock\nIn external clock mode, the external clock not only shiftsdata in and out, it also drives the analog-to-digital con-version steps. SSTRB pulses high for one clock periodafter the last bit of the control byte. Successive-approxi-mation bit decisions are made and appear at DOUT oneach of the next 12 SCLK falling edges (see Figure 6).SSTRB and DOUT go into a high-impedance state whenCSgoes high; after the next CS falling edge, SSTRB will\noutput a logic low. Figure 8 shows the SSTRB timing inexternal clock mode. \nThe conversion must complete in some minimum time, or\nelse droop on the sample-and-hold capacitors maydegrade conversion results. Use internal clock mode if theclock period exceeds 10µs, or if serial-clock interruptionscould cause the conversion interval to exceed 120µs.Low-Power, 8-Channel,\nSerial 12-Bit ADCs\n12 Maxim IntegratedMAX186/MAX188\nSSTRBCS\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUT14 8 1 2 1 6 2 0 2 4\nSTART SEL2 SEL1 SEL0UNI/\nBIPSCL/\nDIFFPD1 PD0\nB11\nMSBB10 B9 B8 B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1B0\nLSB\nACQUISITION\n1.5μ s  (CLK = 2MHz)IDLEFILLED WITH \nZEROS\nIDLE CONVERSIONtACQ\nA/D STATERB1RB2 RB3\n• • •\n• • •\n• • •\n• • •CS\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUTtCSHtCSStCL\ntDS\ntDH\ntDVtCH\ntDO tTRtCSHFigure 6. 24-Bit External Clock Mode Conversion Timing (SPI, QSPI and Microwire Compatible)\nFigure 7. Detailed Serial-Interface Timing\nInternal Clock\nIn internal clock mode, the MAX186/MAX188 generate\ntheir own conversion clock internally. This frees themicroprocessor from the burden of running the SAR con-version clock, and allows the conversion results to beread back at the processor’s convenience, at any clockrate from zero to typically 10MHz. SSTRB goes low at thestart of the conversion and then goes high when the con-version is complete. SSTRB will be low for a maximum of10µs, during which time SCLK should remain low for bestnoise performance. An internal register stores data whenthe conversion is in progress. SCLK clocks the data outat this register at any time after the conversion is com-plete. After SSTRB goes high, the next falling clock edgewill produce the MSB of the conversion at DOUT, fol-lowed by the remaining bits in MSB-first format (seeFigure 9). CS does not need to be held low once a con-\nversion is started. Pulling CS high prevents data from\nbeing clocked into the MAX186/MAX188 and three-states DOUT, but it does not adversely effect an internalclock-mode conversion already in progress. When inter-nal clock mode is selected, SSTRB does not go into ahigh-impedance state when CSgoes high. \nFigure 10 shows the SSTRB timing in internal clockmode. In internal clock mode, data can be shifted in andout of the MAX186/MAX188 at clock rates exceeding4.0MHz, provided that the minimum acquisition time, t\nAZ,\nis kept above 1.5µs.

External Clock Mode SSTRB Detailed Timing\nFigure 9. Internal Clock Mode Timing\nData Framing\nThe falling edge of CS does not start a conversion on the\nMAX186/MAX188. The first logic high clocked into DIN is\ninterpreted as a start bit and defines the first bit of thecontrol byte. A conversion starts on the falling edge ofSCLK, after the eighth bit of the control byte (the PD0 bit)is clocked into DIN. The start bit is defined as: \nThe first high bit clocked into DIN with CSlow any-\ntime the  converter is idle, e.g. after V\nCCis applied.\nOR\nThe first high bit clocked into DIN after bit 5 of a\nconversion in progress is clocked onto the DOUT pin.\nIf a falling edge on CSforces a start bit before bit 5\n(B5) becomes available, then the current conversion\nwill be terminated and a new one started. Thus, thefastest the MAX186/MAX188 can run is 15 clocks perconversion. Figure 11a shows the serial-interface timingnecessary to perform a conversion every 15 SCLKcycles in external clock mode. If CS is low and SCLK is\ncontinuous, guarantee a start bit by first clocking in 16zeros.\nMost microcontrollers require that conversions occur in\nmultiples of 8 SCLK clocks; 16 clocks per conversionwill typically be the fastest that a microcontroller candrive the MAX186/MAX188. Figure 11b shows theserial-interface timing necessary to perform a conver-sion every 16 SCLK cycles in external clock mode. __________ Applications Information\nPower-On Reset\nWhen power is first applied and if SHDN is not pulled\nlow, internal power-on reset circuitry will activate theMAX186/MAX188 in internal clock mode, ready to con-vert with SSTRB = high. After the power supplies havebeen stabilized, the internal reset time is 100µs and noconversions should be performed during this phase.SSTRB is high on power-up and, if CS is low, the first\nlogical 1 on DIN will be interpreted as a start bit. Until aconversion takes place, DOUT will shift out zeros. \nReference-Buffer Compensation\nIn addition to its shutdown function, the SHDN pin also\nselects internal or external compensation. The compen-sation affects both power-up time and maximum conver-sion speed. Compensated or not, the minimum clockrate is 100kHz due to droop on the sample-and-hold. \nTo select external compensation, open SHDN. See the\nTypical Operating Circuit , which uses a 4.7µF capacitor at\nVREF. A value of 4.7µF or greater ensures stability and\nallows operation of the converter at the full clock speed of2MHz. External compensation increases power-up time (seethe \nChoosing Power-Down Mode section, and Table 5).\nInternal compensation requires no external capacitor atVREF, and is selected by pulling SHDN high. Internal com-\npensation allows for shortest power-up times, but is onlyavailable using an external clock and reduces the maxi-mum clock rate to 400kHz.

Pull SHDN low at any time to\nshut down the converter completely. SHDN overrides\nbits 7 and 8 of DIN word (see Table 7).\nFull power-down mode turns off all chip functions that draw\nquiescent current, reducing I\nDDand I SStypically to 2µA. \nFast power-down mode turns off all circuitry except thebandgap reference. With the fast power-down mode, thesupply current is 30µA. Power-up time can be shortenedto 5µs in internal compensation mode. \nIn both software shutdown modes, the serial interface\nremains operational, however, the ADC will not convert.Table 5 illustrates how the choice of reference-buffercompensation and power-down mode affects bothpower-up delay and maximum sample rate. \nIn external compensation mode, the power-up time is\n20ms with a 4.7µF compensation capacitor (200ms witha 33µF capacitor) when the capacitor is fully discharged.In fast power-down, you can eliminate start-up time byusing low-leakage capacitors that will not dischargemore than 1/2LSB while shut down. In shutdown, thecapacitor has to supply the current into the reference(1.5µA typ) and the transient currents at power-up.\nFigures 12a and 12b illustrate the various power-down\nsequences in both external and internal clock modes.\nSoftware Power-Down \nSoftware power-down is activated using bits PD1 and\nPD0 of the control byte. As shown in Table 6, PD1 andPD0 also specify the clock mode. When software shut-down is asserted, the ADC will continue to operate inthe last specified clock mode until the conversion iscomplete. Then the ADC powers down into a low quies-cent-current state. In internal clock mode, the interfaceremains active and conversion results may be clockedout while the MAX186/MAX188 have already entered asoftware power-down. \nThe first logical 1 on DIN will be interpreted as a start\nbit, and powers up the MAX186/MAX188. Following thestart bit, the data input word or control byte also deter-mines clock and power-down modes. For example, ifthe DIN word contains PD1 = 1, then the chip willremain powered up. If PD1 = 0, a power-down willresume after one conversion.Low-Power, 8-Channel,\nSerial 12-Bit ADCs\nMaxim Integrated 15MAX186/MAX188\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUTCS\nS CONTROL BYTE 0 CONTROL BYTE 1 S\nCONVERSION RESULT 0B11  B10  B9  B8  B7  B6  B5  B4  B3  B2  B1  B0\nCONVERSION RESULT 1\nSSTRBB11 B10 B9 B8 B7 B6 B5 B4 B3 B2 B1 B0CONTROL BYTE 2S1 81 81\nCS\nSCLK\nDIN\nDOUTS CONTROL BYTE 0 CONTROL BYTE 1 S\nCONVERSION RESULT 0B11  B10  B9  B8  B7  B6  B5  B4  B3  B2  B1  B0 B11   B10   B9   B8\nCONVERSION RESULT 1• • •• • •\n• • •\n• • •Figure 11a.

Unlike with the software shut-down\nmodes, conversion is not completed. It stops coinci-dentally with SHDN being brought low. There is no\npower-up delay if an external reference is used and  isnot shut down. The SHDN pin also selects internal or\nexternal reference compensation (see Table 7).\nPower-Down Sequencing\nThe MAX186/MAX188 auto power-down modes cansave considerable power when operating at less thanmaximum sample rates. The following discussion illus-trates the various power-down sequences. Lowest Power at up to 500\nConversions/Channel/Second\nThe following examples illustrate two different power-downsequences. Other combinations of clock rates, compen-sation modes, and power-down modes may give lowestpower consumption in other applications.\nFigure 14a depicts the MAX186 power consumption for\none or eight channel conversions utilizing fullpower-down mode and internal reference compensation.A 0.01µF bypass capacitor at REFADJ forms an RC filterwith the internal 20kΩ reference resistor with a  0.2ms\ntime constant. To achieve full 12-bit accuracy, 10 timeconstants or 2ms are required after power-up. Waiting2ms in FASTPD mode instead of full power-up will reducethe power consumption by a factor of 10 or more. This isachieved by using the  sequence shown in Figure 13.Figure 12b. Timing Diagram Power-Down Modes, Internal Clock\nFigure 13. MAX186 FULLPD/FASTPD Power-Up Sequence\nLowest Power at Higher Throughputs\nFigure 14b shows the power consumption with\nexternal-reference compensation in fast power-down,with one and eight channels converted. The external4.7µF compensation requires a 50µs wait after power-up,accomplished by 75 idle clocks after a dummy conver-sion. This circuit combines fast multi-channel conversionwith lowest power consumption possible. Fullpower-down mode may provide increased power sav-ings in applications where the MAX186/MAX188 areinactive for long periods of time, but where intermittentbursts of high-speed conversions are required.\nExternal and Internal References \nThe MAX186 can be used with an internal or externalreference, whereas an external reference is required forthe MAX188. Diode D1 shown in the \nTypical Operating\nCircuit ensures correct start-up. Any standard signal\ndiode can be used. For both parts, an external refer-ence can either be connected directly at the VREF ter-minal or at the REFADJ pin. \nAn internal buffer is designed to provide 4.096V at\nVREF for both the MAX186 and MAX188. TheMAX186’s internally trimmed 2.46V reference isbuffered with a gain of 1.678. The MAX188's buffer  istrimmed with a buffer gain of 1.638  to scale an external2.5V reference at REFADJ to 4.096V at VREF. \nMAX186 Internal Reference\nThe full-scale range of the MAX186 with internal referenceis 4.096V with unipolar inputs, and ±2.048V with bipolarinputs. The internal reference voltage is adjustable to±1.5% with the Reference-Adjust Circuit of Figure 17.External Reference\nWith both the MAX186 and MAX188, an external refer-\nence can be placed at either the input (REFADJ) or theoutput (VREF) of the internal buffer amplifier. TheREFADJ input impedance is typically 20kΩ for the\nMAX186 and higher than 100kΩ for the MAX188, where\nthe internal reference is omitted. At VREF, the inputimpedance is a minimum of 12kΩ for DC currents.\nDuring conversion, an external reference at VREF mustbe able to deliver up to 350µA DC load current and havean output impedance of 10 Ωor less. If the reference has\nhigher output impedance or is noisy, bypass it close tothe VREF pin with a 4.7µF capacitor.

To use the direct VREF input,disable the internal buffer by tying REFADJ to V\nDD.\nTransfer Function and Gain Adjust\nFigure 15 depicts the nominal, unipolar input/output\n(I/O) transfer function, and Figure 16 shows the bipolarinput/output transfer function. Code transitions occurhalfway between successive integer LSB values. Outputcoding is binary with 1 LSB = 1.00mV (4.096V/4096) forunipolar operation and 1 LSB = 1.00mV ((4.096V/2 --4.096V/2)/4096) for bipolar operation.\nFigure 17, the MAX186 Reference-Adjust Circuit, shows\nhow to adjust the ADC gain in applications that use theinternal reference. The circuit provides ±1.5%(±65LSBs) of gain adjustment range. \nLayout, Grounding, Bypassing\nFor best performance, use printed circuit boards.Wire-wrap boards are not recommended. Board layoutshould ensure that digital and analog signal lines areseparated from each other. Do not run analog and digi-tal (especially clock) lines parallel to one another, ordigital lines underneath the ADC package.\nFigure 18 shows the recommended system ground\nconnections. A single-point analog ground (“star”ground point) should be established at AGND, sepa-rate from the logic ground. All other analog groundsand DGND should be connected to this ground. Noother digital system ground should be connected tothis single-point analog ground. The ground return tothe power supply for this ground should be low imped-ance and as short as possible for noise-free operation.\nHigh-frequency noise in the V\nDDpower supply may\naffect the high-speed comparator in the ADC.

ThisQSPI circuit can be programmed to do a conversion oneach of the eight channels. The result is stored in mem-ory without taxing the CPU since QSPI incorporates itsown micro-sequencer. Figure 19 depicts the MAX186,but the same circuit could be used with the MAX188 byadding an external reference to VREF and connectingREFADJ to V\nDD.\nFigure 20 details the code that sets up QSPI forautonomous operation. In external clock mode, theMAX186/MAX188 perform a single-ended, unipolar con-version on each of their eight analog input channels.Figure 21, QSPI Assembly-Code Timing, shows the tim-ing associated with the assembly code of Figure 20. Thefirst byte clocked into the MAX186/MAX188 is the controlbyte, which triggers the first conversion on CH0. The lasttwo bytes clocked into the MAX186/MAX188 are all zeroand clock out the results of the CH7 conversion.Low-Power, 8-Channel,\nSerial 12-Bit ADCs\n20 Maxim IntegratedMAX186/MAX188\n+5V -5V GNDSUPPLIES\nDGND +5V DGND V SS AGND VDD\nDIGITAL\nCIRCUITRYMAX186/MAX188R* = 10Ω\n* OPTIONAL\nFigure 18.
