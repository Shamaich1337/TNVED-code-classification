The controlled slew \nrate limits the data rate to 500 kbps. The device’s input impedance is 96 kΩ, allowing up to 256 transceivers on the bus. Its driver has an active -high enable  feature . The driver differential outputs \nand receiver differential inputs are connected internally to form a differential input/output ( I/O) port.  When the driver is disabled or when V\nDD1 or V DD2 = 0 V , this \nimposes minimal loading  on the bus. An active -high receiver \ndisable  feature , which causes the receive output to enter a high \nimpedance state, is provided as well.  \nThe receiver inputs have a true fail- safe feature that ensures a \nlogic -high receiver output level when the inputs ar e open or \nshorted. This guarantees that the receiver outputs are in a known state before communication begins and at the point \nwhen communication ends.  \nCurrent limiting and thermal shutdown features protect against \noutput short circuits and bus contention situations that might \ncause excessive power dissipation. The part is fully specified over the industrial temperature range and is available in a \n16-lead, wide body SOIC package.  \nADM2483  Data Sheet \nRev.

F | Page 14 of 18 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nELECTRICAL ISOLATION \nIn the ADM2483 , electrical isolation is implemented on the \nlogic side of the interface. Therefore, the part has two main \nsections: a digital isolation section and a transceiver section (see Figure 26). Driver input and data enable signals, applied to the \nTxD and DE pins, respectively, and referenced to logic ground \n(GND\n1), are coupled across an isolation barrier to appear at the \ntransceiver section referenced to isolated ground (GND 2). \nSimilarly, the receiver output, referenced to isolated ground in the transceiver section, is coupled across the isolation barrier to \nappear at the RxD pin referenced to logic ground.  iCoupler Technology \nThe digital signals are transmitted across the isolation barrier \nusing iCoupler technology. This technique uses chip scale trans-\nformer windings to couple the digital signals magnetically from \none side of the barrier to the other. Digital inputs are encoded into waveforms that are capable of exciting the primary transformer winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are \nthen decoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted.  \n \n \n04736-025RETxD DECODE ENCODE\nDE DECODE ENCODE\nRxD DECODE ENCODEISOLATION\nBARRIER\nDIGITAL ISOLATION TRANSCEIVERD\nRAVDD1 VDD2\nGND 1 GND 2B\n \nFigure 26.

When the V DD1 power -down threshold \nis crossed, the ADM2483 output signals reach their unpowered \nstates within 4 µs.  \nTable 12. Power -Up/Power -Down Thresholds  \nSupply  Transition  Threshold (V)  \nVDD1 Power -up 2.0 \nVDD1 Power -down  1.0 \nVDD2 Power -up 3.3 \nVDD2 Power -down  2.4 THERMAL SHUTDOWN  \nThe ADM2483 contains thermal shutdown circuitry that protects  \nthe part  from excessive power dissipation during fault conditions. \nShorting t he driver outputs to a low impedance source can result \nin high driver currents. The thermal sensing circuitry detects \nthe inc rease in die temperature under  this condition and disable s \nthe driver outputs. This circuitry is designed to disable the \ndriver outputs when a die temperature of 150°C is reached. As the device cools, the drivers are re -enabled at a temperature of \n140°C.  \nTRUE FAIL -SAFE RECEIVER INPUTS  \nThe receiver inputs have a true fail -safe feature, which ensures \nthat the receiver output is high when the inputs are open or shorted. During line -idle conditions, when no driver on the bus \nis enabled, the voltage across a terminating resistance at the rec eiver \ninput decays to 0 V . With traditional transceivers, receiver input thresholds specified between −200 mV and +200  mV mean that \nextern al bias resistors are required on the A  and B pins to ensure  \nthat the receiver outputs are in a known state. The true fail -safe \nreceiver input feature eliminates the need for bias resistors by specifying the receiver input threshold between −30 mV and \n−200 mV . The guaranteed negative threshold means that when \nthe voltage between A and B decays to 0 V , the receiver output is \nguaranteed to be high.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD IMMUN ITY \nBecause iCouplers use a coreless technology, no magnetic \ncompo nents are present, and the problem of magnetic saturat ion \nof the core material does not exist. Therefore, iCouplers have \nessentially infinite dc  field immunity. The analysis that follows \ndefines the conditions under which this might occur. The 3 V \noperating condition  of the ADM2483 is examined because it \nrepresents the most susceptible mode of operation.  \nThe limitation on the iCoupler’s ac magnetic field immunity is \nset by the condition in which the induced error voltage in the \nreceiving coil (the bottom coil in this case) is made sufficiently \nlarge, either to falsely set or reset the de coder. The voltage \ninduced across the bottom coil is given by  \n;π2\nnrdtdV ∑\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8ebβ−=  N n ,...,2,1=  \nwhere if the pulses at the transformer output are greater than \n1.0 V in amplitude:  \nβ= magnetic flux density (gauss)  \nN= number of turns in receiving coil  \nrn = radius of nth turn in receiving coil (cm)  \nThe decoder has a sensing threshold of about 0.5 V; therefore, \nthere is a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be tolerated.   \nGiven the geometry o f the receiving coil and an imposed \nrequirement that the induced voltage is, at most, 50% of the  \n0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable magnetic field is calculated, as shown in Figure 27.  \nADM2483 Data Sheet \n \nRev.

Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maxi -\nmum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kGauss induces a voltage \nof 0.25 V at  the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing \nthreshold  and does not cause a faulty output transition. Similarly,  if \nsuch an event occurs during a transmitted pulse and is the worst-\ncase p olarity, it reduces the rec eived pulse from >1.0 V to 0.75  V. \nThis is well above the 0.5 V sensing threshold of the decoder. \nThese magnetic flux density values are shown in Figure 28, \nusing more familiar quantities such as maxi mum allowable \ncurrent flow, at given distances away from the ADM2483 \ntransformers.  1000.00\n100.00\n0.101.0010.00\n0.01\n1k 10k 100k 1M 10M 100M\n04736-028\nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)DISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 5mm\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n \nFigure 28.

To avoid this possibility, care should be taken in the \nlayout of such traces.  \n \nData Sheet ADM2483\n \nRev. F | Page 17 of 18 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nPOWER_VALID INPUT \nTo avoid chatter on the A and B outputs caused by slow power-up \nand power-down transients on V DD1 (>100 μs/V), the ADM2483  \nfeatures a power_valid (PV) digital input. This pin should be \ndriven low until V DD1 exceeds 2.0 V . When V DD1 is greater than \n2.0 V , the pin should be driven high. Conversely, upon power-\ndown, the PV should be driven low before V DD1 reaches 2.0 V . \nThe power_valid input can be driven, for example, by the output of \na system reset circuit such as the ADM809Z, which has a threshold \nvoltage of 2.32 V . \n04736-029VDD12.32V\ntPOR2.0V2.32V2.0V\nRESETRESETADM809ZADM2483VDD1\nPV\nGND1VDD1\n \nFigure 29. Driving PV with  ADM809Z  ISOLATED POWER SUPPLY CIRCUIT \nThe ADM2483  requires isolated power capable of 5 V at 100 mA \nto be supplied between the V DD2 and GND 2 pins. If no suitable \nintegrated power supply is available, a discrete circuit, such as the one in Figure 30, can be used. A center-tapped transformer \nprovides electrical isolation. The primary winding is excited \nwith a pair of square waveforms that are 180° out of phase with each other. A pair of Schottky diodes and a smoothing capacitor are used to create a rectified signal from the secondary winding. The ADP667  linear voltage regulator provides a regulated \npower supply to the ADM2483 ’s bus-side circuitry. \nTo create the pair of square waves, a D-type flip-flop with comple-\nmentary Q/ Q\n outputs is used. The flip-flop can be connected so \nthat output Q follows the clock input signal. If no local clock \nsignal is available, a simple digital oscillator can be implemented \nwith a hex-inverting Schmitt trigger and a resistor and capacitor. \nIn this case, values of 3.9 kΩ and 1 nF generate a 364 kHz square \nwave. A pair of discrete NMOS transistors, switched by the Q/ Q \nflip-flop outputs, conduct current through the center tap of the primary transformer, winding in an alternating fashion. \n \n  \n04736-0303.9k\uf057\n100nF\n1nF74HC14VCC\n74HC74APR CLR\nDQ\nCLK QBS107A\nBS107AVCCISOLATION\nBARRIER\nSD103C\n22\uf06dF\nSD103C78253100nFVCC\nIN OUT5V\nSET SHDN GNDADP667\nVDD1 VDD2\nGND 1 GND 2ADM2483VCC\n \nFigure 30.
