### Component Summary: LFCN-2500+

**Description:**
The LFCN-2500+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed for RF applications. It operates within a frequency range of DC to 2500 MHz and is suitable for applications requiring harmonic rejection and signal integrity. The filter is constructed using LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) technology, which provides excellent temperature stability and power handling capabilities.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; however, the RF power input is rated at 10W max at 25°C.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; current handling is typically inferred from power ratings.
- **Power Consumption:** RF Power Input: 10W max at 25°C.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (small size).
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling (10W).
  - Temperature stable.
  - 7 sections for improved performance.
  - Protected by U.S. Patent 6,943,646.
  - RoHS compliant.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Typical Performance Data at 25°C:**
- **Insertion Loss:** 
  - DC to 2500 MHz: ≤ 1.0 dB
  - Cut-off Frequency (3075 MHz): ≤ 3.0 dB
- **VSWR (Voltage Standing Wave Ratio):** 
  - DC to 2500 MHz: ≤ 1.2:1
- **Stop Band Rejection Loss:**
  - 3675 MHz: ≥ 20 dB
  - 3800-6100 MHz: ≥ 30 dB
  - 8000 MHz: ≥ 20 dB

**Typical Applications:**
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in systems where unwanted harmonics need to be filtered out.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Ideal for communication systems operating in VHF and UHF bands.
- **Laboratory Use:** Suitable for testing and measurement applications requiring precise signal filtering.

This low pass filter is particularly useful in RF applications where maintaining signal integrity while minimizing unwanted high-frequency signals is critical. Its compact size and robust performance make it a versatile choice for various electronic designs.
