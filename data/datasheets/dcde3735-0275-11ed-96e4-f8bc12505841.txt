### Component Summary: AP0809ES3-S

**Description:**
The AP0809ES3-S is a three-pin microprocessor reset chip designed to monitor supply voltage levels in microcontrollers and other logic systems. It is packaged in a compact SOT23-3L format, making it suitable for portable and battery-powered devices. The chip generates a reset signal when the supply voltage falls below a preset threshold, ensuring reliable operation during power-up, power-down, and power-saving conditions.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Operating Voltage (VCC): 1.1V to 5.5V
  - Reset Threshold Voltage (VT): Specific values for different versions (e.g., 2.63V, 2.93V, 3.08V)
  
- **Current Ratings:**
  - Supply Current (Icc): 2µA (typical)
  - Output Current: 20mA (maximum)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Power Dissipation: 320mW (at 70°C), with a derating of 4mW/°C above 70°C

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40°C to +105°C

- **Package Type:**
  - SOT23-3L

- **Special Features:**
  - No external components required for operation
  - Valid reset output is active low
  - Reset signal duration: 140ms (minimum), 250ms (typical)
  - Low supply current makes it ideal for battery-operated devices

- **Moisture Sensitive Level:**
  - Level 1 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The AP0809ES3-S is commonly used in:
- Microprocessor systems
- Computers
- Controllers
- Smart instruments
- Portable and battery-powered devices

This reset chip is essential for ensuring that microcontrollers operate reliably by providing a reset signal during critical power conditions, thus preventing erratic behavior due to voltage fluctuations.
