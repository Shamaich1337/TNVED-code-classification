Duty Cycle Control\n•Under-Voltage Lockout with Hysteresis\n•Low Start Up Current (1.1mA)The UC1825 family of PWM control ICs is optimized for high fre -\nquency switched mode power supply applications. Particular care\nwas given to minimizing propagation delays through the comparatorsand logic circuitry while maximizing bandwidth and slew rate of theerror amplifier. This controller is designed for use in either cur -\nrent-mode or voltage mode systems with the capability for input volt -\nage feed-forward.\nProtection circuitry includes a current limit comparator with a 1V\nthreshold, a TTL compatible shutdown port, and a soft start pinwhich will double as a maximum duty cycle clamp. The logic is fullylatched to provide jitter free operation and prohibit multiple pulses atan output.An under-voltage lockout section with 800mV of hysteresisassures low start up current. During under-voltage lockout, the out -\nputs are high impedance.\nThese devices feature totem pole outputs designed to source and\nsink high peak currents from capacitive loads, such as the gate of apower MOSFET.The on state is designed as a high level.High Speed PWM Controller\nFEATURES DESCRIPTIONapplication\nINFO\navailable\nUDG-92030-2\n2UC1825\nUC2825UC3825CONNECTION  DIAGRAMS\nDIL-16 (Top View)\nJ or N Package\nSOIC-16 (Top View)\nDW  PackagePACKAGE PIN FUNCTION\nFUNCTION PIN\nN/C 1\nINV 2NI 3E/A Out 4Clock 5N/C 6R\nT 7\nCT 8\nRamp 9Soft Start 10N/C 11ILIM/SD 12Gnd 13Out A 14Pwr Gnd 15N/C 16V\nC 17\nOut B 18V\nCC 19\nVREF5.1V 20PLCC-20 & LCC-20\n(Top View)Q & L PackagesABSOLUTE  MAXIMUM  RATINGS (Note 1)\nSupply Voltage (Pins 13, 15). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30V\nOutput Current, Source or Sink (Pins 11, 14)DC . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 0.5APulse (0.5 /c109s) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2.0A\nAnalog Inputs(Pins 1, 2, 7). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.3V to 7V(Pin 8, 9) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -0.3V to 6VClock Output Current (Pin 4). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -5mAError Amplifier Output Current (Pin 3) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 5mASoft Start Sink Current (Pin 8) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 20mAOscillator Charging Current (Pin 5). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . -5mAPower Dissipation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1WStorage Temperature Range. . . . . . . . . . . . . . -65°C to +150°CLead Temperature (Soldering, 10 seconds) . . . . . . . . . . 300°C\nPackage /c81JA /c81JC\nDIL-16J 80-120 28(2)\nDIL-16N 90(1)45\nPLCC-20 43-75(1) 34\nLCC-20 70-80 20(2)\nSOIC-16 50-120(1)35THERMAL RATINGS TABLE\n/c81\n/c81\n3UC1825\nUC2825UC3825\nELECTRICAL  CHARACTERISTICS:\nUnless otherwise stated, these specifications apply for , R T= 3.65k, C T= 1nF, V CC\n= 15V,  -55 °C<TA<125°C for the UC1825, –40 °C<TA<85°C for the UC2825, and 0 °C<TA<70°C for the UC3825,  T A=TO.\nUC1825UC3825PARAMETERS TEST CONDITIONS UC2825\nMIN TOP MAX MIN TOP MAX UNITS\nReference Section\nOutput Voltage T O= 25°C, IO= 1mA 5.05 5.10 5.15 5.00 5.10 5.20 V\nLine Regulation 10V < V CC< 30V 2 20 2 20 mV\nLoad Regulation 1mA < I O< 10mA 5 20 5 20 mV\nTemperature Stability* T MIN< TA<TMAX 0.2 0.4 0.2 0.4 mV/ °C\nTotal Output Variation* Line, Load, Temperature 5.00 5.20 4.95 5.25 VOutput Noise Voltage* 10Hz < f < 10kHz 50 50 µV\nLong Term Stability* T\nJ= 125°C, 1000hrs. 5 25 5 25 mV\nShort Circuit Current V REF= 0V -15 -50 -100 -15 -50 -100 mA\nOscillator Section\nInitial Accuracy* T J= 2°C 360 400 440 360 400 440 kHz\nVoltage Stability* 10V < V CC< 30V 0.2 2 0.2 2 %\nTemperature Stability* T MIN< TA<TMAX 55 %\nTotal Variation* Line, Temperature 340 460 340 460 kHz\nOscillator Section (cont.)\nClock Out High 3.9 4.5 3.9 4.5 VClock Out Low 2.3 2.9 2.3 2.9 VRamp Peak * 2.6 2.8 3.0 2.6 2.8 3.0 V\nRamp Valley * 0.7 1.0 1.25 0.7 1.0 1.25 V\nRamp Valley to Peak * 1.6 1.8 2.0 1.6 1.8 2.0 V\nError Amplifier Section\nInput Offset Voltage 10 15 mVInput Bias Current 0.6 3 0.6 3 µA\nInput Offset Current 0.1 1 0.1 1 µA\nOpen Loop Gain 1V < V\nO< 4V 60 95 60 95 dB\nCMRR 1.5V < V CM< 5.5V 75 95 75 95 dB\nPSRR 10V < V CC< 30V 85 110 85 110 dB\nOutput Sink Current V PIN 3= 1V 1 2.5 1 2.5 mA\nOutput Source Current V PIN 3= 4V -0.5 -1.3 -0.5 -1.3 mA\nOutput High Voltage I PIN 3= -0.5mA 4.0 4.7 5.0 4.0 4.7 5.0 V\nOutput Low Voltage I PIN 3= 1mA 0 0 .5 1.0 0 0.5 1.0 V\nUnity Gain Bandwidth * 3 5.5 3 5.5 MHz\nSlew Rate * 6 12 6 12 V/ µs\n4UC1825\nUC2825UC3825\nUC1825UC3825PARAMETERS TEST CONDITIONS UC2825\nMIN TOP MAX MIN TOP MAX UNITS\nPWM Comparator Section\nPin 7 Bias Current V PIN 7= 0V -1 -5 -1 -5 µA\nDuty Cycle Range 0 80 0 85 %Pin 3 Zero DC Threshold V\nPIN 7= 0V 1.1 1.25 1.1 1.25 V\nDelay to Output * 50 80 50 80 ns\nSoft-Start Section\nCharge Current V PIN 8= 0.5V 3 9 20 3 9 20 µA\nDischarge Current V PIN 8= 1V 1 1 mA\nCurrent Limit / Shutdown Section\nPin 9 Bias Current 0 < V PIN 9< 4V 15 10 µA\nCurrent Limit Threshold 0.9 1.0 1.1 0.9 1.0 1.1 VShutdown Threshold 1.25 1.40 1.55 1.25 1.40 1.55 VDelay to Output 50 80 50 80 ns\nOutput Section\nOutput Low Level I\nOUT= 20mA 0.25 0.40 0.25 0.40 V\nIOUT= 200mA 1.2 2.2 1.2 2.2 V\nOutput High Level I OUT= -20mA 13.0 13.5 13.0 13.5 V\nIOUT= -200mA 12.0 13.0 12.0 13.0 V\nCollector Leakage V C= 30V 100 500 10 500 µA\nRise/Fall Time * CL = 1nF 30 60 30 60 ns\nUnder-Voltage Lockout Section\nStart Threshold 8.8 9.2 9.6 8.8 9.2 9.6 VUVLO Hysteresis 0.4 0.8 1.2 0.4 0.8 1.2 V\nSupply Current Section\nStart Up Current V\nCC= 8V 1.1 2.5 1.1 2.5 mA\nICC V PIN 1, VPIN 7, VPIN 9= 0V;

To assure proper perfor -\nmance of the UC1825 follow these rules:1) Use a ground\nplane. 2) Damp or clamp parasitic inductive kick energyfrom the gate of driven MOSFETs. Do not allow the out -\nput pins to ring below ground. A series gate resistor or a\nshunt 1 Amp Schottky diode at the output pin will servethis purpose. 3) Bypass V\nCC,VC, and V REF. Use 0.1 µF\nmonolithic ceramic capacitors with low equivalent seriesinductance. Allow less than 1 cm of total lead length foreach capacitor between the bypassed pin and the groundplane. 4) Treat the timing capacitor, CT, like a bypass ca -\npacitor.\nOpen Loop Frequency Response Unity Gain Slew RateSimplified SchematicError Amplifier Circuit\nPWM Applications\nConventional (Voltage Mode)Current-ModePrinted Circuit Board Layout Considerations\n6UC1825\nUC2825UC3825 Oscillator Circuit\nTiming Resistance vs Frequency\n80100120140160\n10k 100k470pF1.0nF\n1MFREQ (Hz)T (ns)DDeadtime vs Frequency\nSynchronized Operation\nTwo Units in Close Proximity Generalized SynchronizationµDeadtime vs C T(3k RT100k)\n7UC1825\nUC2825UC3825 Forward Technique for Off-Line Voltage Mode Application\nConstant Volt-Second Clamp Circuit\nThe circuit shown here will achieve a constant\nvolt-second product clamp over varying input voltages.The ramp generator components, R\nTand CRare cho-\nsen so that the ramp at Pin 9 crosses the 1V threshold\nat the same time the desired maximum volt-secondproduct is reached.
