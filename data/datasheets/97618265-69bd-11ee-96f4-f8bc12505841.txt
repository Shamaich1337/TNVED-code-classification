#### Description:
The LFCN-80+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed to allow signals below a certain frequency (80 MHz) to pass while attenuating signals above this frequency. It is constructed using Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic (LTCC) technology, which provides excellent thermal stability and power handling capabilities. The filter is compact, featuring a seven-section design that enhances its performance characteristics.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in applications where it is critical to suppress unwanted harmonic frequencies.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Ideal for communication systems operating in the VHF and UHF bands, where filtering out higher frequency noise is essential for signal clarity.
- **RF Signal Processing:** Suitable for various RF applications where low pass filtering is required to maintain signal integrity.

This low pass filter is particularly useful in RF design, ensuring that only the desired frequency components are transmitted while minimizing interference from higher frequency signals.
