The \ntransmitters are easily identified by the light gray color connector port. The receivers are easily identified by the dark gray \ncolor connector port. (Black color for the conductive port.) The package is designed for pick and place and wave soldering, \nso it is ideal for high volume production applications.\nHandling and Design Information\nEach part comes with a protective port cap or plug covering the optics. \nNOTE: This plastic or rubber port cap is made to protect the optical path during assembly. It is not meant to remain on the \npart for a long period. These caps/plugs will vary by port style. When soldering, it is advisable to leave the protective \ncap on the unit to keep the optics clean. Good system performance requires clean port optics and cable ferrules \nto avoid obstructing the optical path.\nClean compressed air often is sufficient to remove particles of dirt; methanol on a cotton swab also works well.\nRecommended Chemicals for Cleaning/Degreasing 820 nm Miniature Link \nProducts\n\uf06eAlcohols: methyl, isopropyl, isobutyl.\n\uf06eAliphatics: hexane, heptane, Other: soap solution, naphtha.\nDo not use partially halogenated hydrocarbons (such as 1.1.1 trichloroethane), ketones (such as MEK), acetone, chloroform, \nethyl acetate, methylene dichloride, phenol, methylene chloride, or N-methylpyrolldone. Also, Broadcom does not \nrecommend the use of cleaners that use halogenated hydrocarbons because of their potential environmental harm.\nBroadcom AV02-0176EN\n7HFBR-14xxZ and HFBR-24xxZ Series  Data Sheet Low-Cost, 820 nm Miniature Link Fiber-Optic Components with ST, SMA, SC, and FC Ports\nMechanical Dimensions (SMA Port)\nHFBR-x40xZ\nDimensions in mm (inches).\nMechanical Dimensions (ST Port)\nHFBR-x41xZ\nDimensions in mm (inches).6.35\n(0.25)\n2.54\n(0.10)3.81\n(0.15)6.4\n(0.25)DIA.12.7\n(0.50)12.7\n(0.50)\n22.2\n(0.87)\n5.1\n(0.20)10.2\n(0.40)3.6\n(0.14)\n1.27\n(0.05)\n2.54\n(0.10)PINS 1,4,5,8\n0.51 X 0.38\n(0.020 X 0.015)\nPINS 2,3,6,7\n0.46\n(0.018)DIA.\n81 3\n52 4\n6 7\nPIN NO. 1\nINDICATOR1/4 - 36 UNS 2A THREADAVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x40xZ\nTX/RX   YYWW\n8.2\n(0.32)\n6.35\n(0.25)12.7\n(0.50)\n27.2\n(1.07)\n5.1\n(0.20)10.2\n(0.40)3.6\n(0.14)\n1.27\n(0.05)\n2.54\n(0.10)81 3\n52 4\n6 7\nPIN NO. 1\nINDICATOR2.54\n(0.10)3.81\n(0.15)DIA.12.7\n(0.50)\n7.0\n(0.28)4.9\n(0.193)max.\nPINS 1,4,5,8\n  0.51 X 0.38  (0.020 X 0.015)\nPINS 2,3,6,7\nØ0.46\n    (0.018)\nAVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x41xZ\nTX/RX   YYWW\nBroadcom AV02-0176EN\n8HFBR-14xxZ and HFBR-24xxZ Series  Data Sheet Low-Cost, 820 nm Miniature Link Fiber-Optic Components with ST, SMA, SC, and FC Ports\nMechanical Dimensions (Metal ST Port)\nHFBR-x41xMZ\nDimensions in mm (inches).\nMechanical Dimensions (Threaded ST Port)\nHFBR-x41xTZ\nDimensions in mm (inches).PIN NO. 1\nINDICATORPINS 1,4,5,8\n0.51 × 0.38\n(0.020 × 0.015)\nPINS 2,3,6,7\n0.46 DIA.\n(0.018) DIA.4.9\n(0.193)\n8.4\n(0.33)\n6.35\n(0.25)\n5.1(0.20)10.2\n(0.40)3.6\n(0.14)\n1.27\n(0.05)\n2.54\n(0.10)12.7\n(0.50)\n27.2\n(1.07)\n12.7\n(0.50)\n2.54\n(0.10)3.81\n(0.15)DIA. 7.0\n(0.28)81 3\n52 4\n6 7MAX.AVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x41xMZ\nTX/RX   YYWW\n5.1\n(0.20)\n3/8 - 32 UNEF - 2A8.4\n(0.33)\n6.35\n(0.25)12.7\n(0.50)\n27.2\n(1.07)\n5.1\n(0.20)10.2\n(0.40)3.6\n(0.14)\n1.27\n(0.05)\n2.54\n(0.10)PINS 1,4,5,8\n0.51 × 0.38\n(0.020 × 0.015)\nPINS 2,3,6,7\n0.46\n(0.018)DIA.\n81 3\n52 4\n6 7\nPIN NO. 1\nINDICATOR2.54\n(0.10)3.81\n(0.15)DIA.12.7\n(0.50)\n7.1\n(0.28)\nDIA.7.6\n(0.30)4.9\n(0.193)MAX.AVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x41xTZ\nTX/RX   YYWW\nBroadcom AV02-0176EN\n9HFBR-14xxZ and HFBR-24xxZ Series  Data Sheet Low-Cost, 820 nm Miniature Link Fiber-Optic Components with ST, SMA, SC, and FC Ports\nMechanical Dimensions (FC Port)\nHFBR-x42xZ\nDimensions in mm (inches).\nMechanical Dimensions (SC Port)\nHFBR-x4ExZ\nDimensions in mm (inches).M8 x 0.75 6G\nTHREAD (METRIC)\n2.54\n(0.10)3.81\n(0.15)7.9\n(0.31)12.7\n(0.50)12.7\n(0.50)\n5.1\n(0.20)10.2\n(0.40)3.6\n(0.14)81 3\n52 4\n6 7\nPIN NO. 1\nINDICATOR19.6\n(0.77)\n2.54\n(0.10)PINS 1,4,5,80.51 X 0.38\n(0.020 X 0.015)\nPINS 2,3,6,7 Ø 0.46\n    (0.018)AVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x42xZ\nTX/RX   YYWW\n28.65\n(1.128)\n15.95\n(0.628)10.0\n(0.394)\n12.7\n(0.50)12.7\n(0.50)\n2.54\n(0.10)3.81\n(0.15)6.35\n(0.25)\n5.1\n(0.20)10.38\n(0.409)3.60\n(0.14)\n1.27\n(0.05)\n2.54\n(0.10)\nPINS 1,4,5,8\n  0.51 × 0.38  (0.020 × 0.015)\nPINS 2,3,6,7\nØ 0.46\n    (0.018)\n81 3\n52 4\n67\nPIN NO. 1\nINDICATORAVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x4ExZ\nTX/RX   YYWW\nBroadcom AV02-0176EN\n10HFBR-14xxZ and HFBR-24xxZ Series  Data Sheet Low-Cost, 820 nm Miniature Link Fiber-Optic Components with ST, SMA, SC, and FC Ports\nCross-Sectional View\nFigure 1:  HFBR-x41xTZ ST Series Cross-Sectional View\nPanel Mount Hardware\nDimensions in mm (inches).\nPort Cap Hardware\n\uf06eHFBR-4402Z: 500 SMA Port Caps\n\uf06eHFBR-4120Z: 500 ST Port PlugsHOUSING\nCONNECTOR PORT\nHEADER\nEPOXY BACKFILL\nPORT GROUNDING PATH INSERTLED OR DETECTOR IC\nLENS–SPHERE\n(ON TRANSMITTERS ONLY)\nLENS–WINDOW\n(Each HFBR-4401Z and HFBR-4411Z kit consists of 100 nuts and 100 washers).7.87\n(0.310)7.87\n(0.310)DIA.1/4 - 36 UNEF -\n2B THREAD\n1.65\n(0.065)\nTYP.\nDIA.\n6.61\n(0.260)DIA.HEX-NUT\nWASHER0.14\n(0.005)14.27\n(0.563)12.70\n(0.50)DIA.3/8 - 32 UNEF -\n2B THREAD\n1.65\n(0.065)\nTYP.\nDIA.\n10.41\n(0.410)MAX.\nDIA.HEX-NUT\nWASHER0.46\n(0.018)3/8 - 32 UNEF - \n2A THREADING0.2 IN.\nWALL\nWASHERNUT1 THREAD AVAILABLEDATE CODE\nPARTNUMBER\nAVAGO\nCOUNTRY OF\nORIGIN\nHFBR-x40xZ\nTX/RX   YYWWHFBR-4401Z: for SMA Ports HFBR-4411Z: for ST Ports\nBroadcom AV02-0176EN\n11HFBR-14xxZ and HFBR-24xxZ Series  Data Sheet Low-Cost, 820 nm Miniature Link Fiber-Optic Components with ST, SMA, SC, and FC Ports\nTypical Link Data\nThe following technical data is taken from 5 MBaud and 155 MBaud link using the 820 nm Miniature Link Series.

Depending on the actual gate used, the voltage drop on the output port Vport could be neglected. \nThe forward voltage value, VF, of the LED depends on the desired LED current and on the temperature (see Figure 9). Make \nsure you take this behavior into account for the calculations.\nThe curves in Figure 3, Figure 4, and Figure 5 are constructed assuming no inline splice or any additional system loss. \nBesides fiber attenuation, for correct power budget calculation, make sure you take into account the effect of bending, \nhumidity, ambient temperature, aging and other relevant influences. All these additional losses reduce the achievable link \ndistance accordingly.\nFor calculating the LED's aging effect, an additional loss of about 1.5 dB is recognized.\nThe following example illustrates the technique for selecting the appropriate value of IF and R1:\nMaximum distance required = 2000 meters by using HFBR-14x4Z/24x2Z logic link with 62.5/125 µm fiber. \nFigure 4 shows the “worst-case” drive current of about 43 mA for reaching a distance of about 2000 meters.\nFigure 9 shows the transmitter forward voltage of about VF = 1.62V. If the typical circuit configuration ( Figure 2) is used at \nVcc = 5.0V, the resistor value “R1” should be chosen to 78.6Ω (3.38V / 43 mA) for reaching driver current of about 43 mA.\nHFBR-14x4Z Output Power Measured Out of 1 Meter of Cable  shows the guaranteed HFBR-14x4Z’s optical output power \nlimit of –16.0 dBm (for driver current of 60 mA) over the entire temperature range.\nFigure 10  shows the normalized typical output power. When the transmitter will be driven with 43 mA, the optical output \npower is about 0.70 or –1.55 dB lower than at 60 mA.\nWith an assumed fiber attenuation of 3.2 dB/km and the reduced driver current of 43 mA, the minimum optical output power \nat fiber end is about –24 dBm, which is equal to the receiver sensitivity over the entire temperature range.\nFor balancing the individual additional system losses, the driver current must be increased accordingly.\nFigure 2:  Typical Circuit Configuration\nNOTE: A bypass capacitor (0.01 µF to 0.1 µm ceramic) must be connected from pin 2 to pin 7 of the receiver.

This \nallows the designer flexibility in choosing the fiber size. The HFBR-14xxZ is designed to operate with the Broadcom® \nHFBR -24xxZ fiber-optic receivers.\nThe HFBR-14xxZ transmitter’s high coupling efficiency allows the emitter to be driven at low current levels resulting in low \npower consumption and increased reliability of the transmitter. The HFBR-14x4Z high power transmitter is optimized for \nsmall size fiber and typically can launch –15.8 dBm optical power at 60 mA into 50/125 µm fiber and –12 dBm into \n62.5/125 µm fiber. The HFBR-14x2Z standard transmitter typically can launch –12 dBm of optical power at 60 mA into \n100/140 µm fiber cable. It is ideal for large size fiber, such as 100/140 µm. The high launched optical power level is useful \nfor systems where star couplers, taps, or inline connectors create large fixed losses.\nFor 820 nm Miniature Link transmitters with protection improved option “P”, a Zener diode parallel to the LED was \nimplemented. Therefore, a higher ESD capability could be attained.\nNOTE: Parameters “reverse input voltage” and “diode capacitance” for “HFBR-141xPxZ” transmitters deviate from the non \nP-parts.\nConsistent coupling efficiency is assured by the double-lens optical system ( Figure 1). Power coupled into any of the three \nfiber types varies less than 5 dB from part to part at a given drive current and temperature. Consistent coupling efficiency \nreduces receiver dynamic range requirements, which allows for longer link lengths.\nHoused Product\nRegulatory Compliance – Targeted Specifications\nFeature Performance Reference\nElectrostatic Discharge (ESD) Class 1C (>1000V, <2000V) – Human Body Model Notes a, b\na.

The HFBR-24x2Z is designed for direct interfacing to popular logic families. The absence \nof an internal pull-up resistor allows the open-collector output to be used with logic families such as CMOS requiring voltage \nexcursions much higher than VCC.\nBoth the open-collector Data output Pin 6 and VCC Pin 2 are referenced to Com Pins 3 and 7. The Data output allows busing, \nstrobing and wired OR circuit configurations. The transmitter is designed to operate from a single +5V supply.

Propagation delay through the system is the result of several sequentially occurring phenomena. Consequently, it is a combination of \ndata-rate-limiting effects and of transmission-time effects. Because of this, the data-rate limit of the system must be described in terms of time \ndifferentials between delays imposed on falling and rising edges. As the cable length is increased, the propagation delays increase at 5 ns \nper meter of length. Data rate, as limited by pulse width distortion, is not affected by increasing cable length if the optical power level at the \nreceiver is maintained.Propagation Delay HIGH to LOW tPHLR — 49 — ns\nBroadcom AV02-0176EN\n25HFBR-14xxZ and HFBR-24xxZ Series  Data Sheet Low-Cost, 820 nm Miniature Link Fiber-Optic Components with ST, SMA, SC, and FC Ports\nHFBR-24x6Z Low-Cost 125 MHz Receiver\nDescription\nThe HFBR-24x6Z fiber-optic receiver is designed to operate with the Broadcom HFBR-14xxZ fiber-optic transmitters and \n50/125 µm, 62.5/125 µm, 100/140 µm, and 200 µm Plastic-Clad Silica (PCS) fiber-optic cable. Consistent coupling into the \nreceiver is assured by the lensed optical system ( Figure 1). Response does not vary with fiber size for core diameters of \n100 µm or less.\nThe receiver output is an analog signal which allows follow-on circuitry to be optimized for a variety of distance/data rate \nrequirements. Low-cost external components can be used to convert the analog output to logic compatible signal levels for \nvarious data formats and data rates up to 175 MBaud. This distance/data rate trade-off results in increased optical power \nbudget at lower data rates, which can be used for additional distance or splices.\nThe HFBR-24x6Z receiver contains a PIN photodiode and low noise transimpedance preamplifier integrated circuit. The \nHFBR-24x6Z receives an optical signal and converts it to an analog voltage. The output is a buffered emitter follower. \nBecause the signal amplitude from the HFBR-24x6Z receiver is much larger than from a simple PIN photodiode, it is less \nsusceptible to EMI, especially at high signaling rates. For very noisy environments, the conductive or metal port option is \nrecommended. A receiver dynamic range of 23 dB over temperature is achievable, assuming a Bit Error Rate (BER) of 10-9.\nThe frequency response is typically DC to 125 MHz. Although the HFBR-24x6Z is an analog receiver, it is compatible with \ndigital systems.\nThe recommended ac coupled receiver circuit is shown in Figure 14 . A 10Ω resistor must be connected between pin 6 and \nthe power supply, and a 100 nF ceramic bypass capacitor must be connected between the power supply and ground. In \naddition, pin 6 should be filtered to protect the receiver from noisy host systems.
