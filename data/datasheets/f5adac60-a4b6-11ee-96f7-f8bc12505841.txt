KG:\nGeneral:\n  \n•This electronic component is designed and manufactured for use in general electronic equipment.   \n•Würth Elektronik must be asked for written approval (following the PPAP procedure) before incorporating the components into any\nequipment in fields such as military, aerospace, aviation, nuclear control, submarine, transportation (automotive control, train control,\nship control), transportation signal, disaster prevention, medical, public information network, etc. where higher safety and reliability are\nespecially required and/or if there is the possibility of direct damage or human injury.   \n•Electronic components that will be used in safety-critical or high-reliability applications, should be pre-evaluated by the customer.   \n•The component is designed and manufactured to be used within the datasheet specified values. If the usage and operation conditions\nspecified in the datasheet are not met, the component may be damaged or dissolved.   \n•Do not drop or impact the components, the component may be damaged.   \n•Würth Elektronik products are qualified according to international standards, which are listed in each product reliability report. Würth\nElektronik does not warrant any customer qualified product characteristics beyond Würth Elektroniks’ specifications, for its validity and\nsustainability over time.   \n•The responsibility for the applicability of the customer specific products and use in a particular customer design is always within the\nauthority of the customer. All technical specifications for standard products also apply to customer specific products.\nProduct specific:\nSoldering:\n  \n•The solder profile must comply with the technical product specifications. All other profiles will void the warranty. Wave soldering is\nallowed for components bigger than 0805 after evaluation and approval.   \n•All other soldering methods are at the customers’ own risk.\nCleaning and Washing:\n  \n•Washing agents used during the production to clean the customer application might damage or change the characteristics of the wire\ninsulation, marking or plating. Washing agents may have a negative effect on the long-term functionality of the product.\nPotting:\n  \n•If the product is potted in the customer application, the potting material might shrink or expand during and after hardening. Shrinking\ncould lead to an incomplete seal, allowing contaminants into the core. Expansion could damage the components. We recommend a\nmanual inspection after potting to avoid these effects. Storage Conditions:\n  \n•A storage of Würth Elektronik products for longer than 12 months is not recommended. Within other effects, the terminals may suffer\ndegradation, resulting in bad solderability. Therefore, all products shall be used within the period of 12 months based on the day of\nshipment.   \n•Do not expose the components to direct sunlight.   \n•The storage conditions in the original packaging are defined according to DIN EN 61760-2.   \n•The storage conditions stated in the original packaging apply to the storage time and not to the transportation time of the components.\nPackaging:\n  \n•The packaging specifications apply only to purchase orders comprising whole packaging units. If the ordered quantity exceeds or is\nlower than the specified packaging unit, packaging in accordance with the packaging specifications cannot be ensured.\nHandling:\n  \n•Violation of the technical product specifications such as exceeding the nominal rated current will void the warranty.   \n•The temperature rise of the component must be taken into consideration. The operating temperature is comprised of ambient\ntemperature and temperature rise of the component.The operating temperature of the component shall not exceed the maximum\ntemperature specified.\nThese cautions and warnings comply with the state of the scientific and technical knowledge and are believed to be accurate and reliable.\nHowever, no responsibility is assumed for inaccuracies or incompleteness.\nWürth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co.

In addition, sufficient reliability evaluation checks for safety\nmust be performed on every electronic component which is used in electrical circuits that require high safety and reliability functions or performance.\nImportant Notes\nThe following conditions apply to all goods within the product range of Würth Elektronik\neiSos GmbH & Co. KG:\n1. General Customer Responsibility\nSome goods within the product range of Würth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG contain statements regarding general suitability for certain\napplication areas. These statements about suitability are based on our knowledge and experience of typical requirements concerning the\nareas, serve as general guidance and cannot be estimated as binding statements about the suitability for a customer application. The\nresponsibility for the applicability and use in a particular customer design is always solely within the authority of the customer. Due to this\nfact it is up to the customer to evaluate, where appropriate to investigate and decide whether the device with the specific product\ncharacteristics described in the product specification is valid and suitable for the respective customer application or not.\n2. Customer Responsibility related to Specific, in particular Safety-Relevant Applications\nIt has to be clearly pointed out that the possibility of a malfunction of electronic components or failure before the end of the usual lifetime\ncannot be completely eliminated in the current state of the art, even if the products are operated within the range of the specifications.\nIn certain customer applications requiring a very high level of safety and especially in customer applications in which the malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component could endanger human life or health it must be ensured by most advanced technological aid of suitable\ndesign of the customer application that no injury or damage is caused to third parties in the event of malfunction or failure of an electronic\ncomponent. Therefore, customer is cautioned to verify that data sheets are current before placing orders. The current data sheets can be\ndownloaded at www.we-online.com.\n3. Best Care and Attention\nAny product-specific notes, cautions and warnings must be strictly observed. Any disregard will result in the loss of warranty.\n4. Customer Support for Product Specifications\nSome products within the product range may contain substances which are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions in order to serve\nspecific technical requirements. Necessary information is available on request. In this case the field sales engineer or the internal sales\nperson in charge should be contacted who will be happy to support in this matter.\n5. Product R&D\nDue to constant product improvement product specifications may change from time to time. As a standard reporting procedure of the\nProduct Change Notification (PCN) according to the JEDEC-Standard inform about minor and major changes. In case of further queries\nregarding the PCN, the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge should be contacted. The basic responsibility of the\ncustomer as per Section 1 and 2 remains unaffected.6. Product Life Cycle\nDue to technical progress and economical evaluation we also reserve the right to discontinue production and delivery of products. As a\nstandard reporting procedure of the Product Termination Notification (PTN) according to the JEDEC-Standard we will inform at an early stage\nabout inevitable product discontinuance. According to this we cannot guarantee that all products within our product range will always be\navailable. Therefore it needs to be verified with the field sales engineer or the internal sales person in charge about the current product\navailability expectancy before or when the product for application design-in disposal is considered. The approach named above does not\napply in the case of individual agreements deviating from the foregoing for customer-specific products.\n7. Property Rights\nAll the rights for contractual products produced by Würth Elektronik eiSos GmbH & Co. KG on the basis of ideas, development contracts as\nwell as models or templates that are subject to copyright, patent or commercial protection supplied to the customer will remain with Würth\nElektronik eiSos GmbH & Co.
