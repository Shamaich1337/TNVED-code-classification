Additionally, theDS3232 incorporates a battery input and maintains accu-rate timekeeping when main power to the device is inter-rupted. The integration of the crystal resonator enhancesthe long-term accuracy of the device as well as reducesthe piece-part count in a manufacturing line. The DS3232is available in commercial and industrial temperatureranges, and is offered in an industry-standard 20-pin,300-mil SO package.\nThe RTC maintains seconds, minutes, hours, day, date,\nmonth, and year information. The date at the end of themonth is automatically adjusted for months with fewerthan 31 days, including corrections for leap year. Theclock operates in either the 24-hour or 12-hour formatwith an AM/PM indicator. Two programmable time-of-day alarms and a programmable square-wave outputare provided. Address and data are transferred seriallythrough an I\n2C bidirectional bus.\nA precision temperature-compensated voltage refer-ence and comparator circuit monitors the status of V\nCC\nto detect power failures, to provide a reset output, andto automatically switch to the backup supply when nec-essary. Additionally, the RST pin is monitored as a\npushbutton input for generating a µP reset.\nApplications\nServers Utility Power Meters\nTelematics GPSFeatures\n♦Accuracy ±2ppm from 0°C to +40°C\n♦Accuracy ±3.5ppm from -40°C to +85°C\n♦Battery Backup Input for Continuous\nTimekeeping\n♦Operating Temperature Ranges\nCommercial: 0°C to +70°CIndustrial: -40°C to +85°C\n♦236 Bytes of Battery-Backed SRAM\n♦Low-Power Consumption\n♦Real-Time Clock Counts Seconds, Minutes,Hours, Day, Date, Month, and Year with Leap YearCompensation Valid Up to 2099\n♦Two Time-of-Day Alarms\n♦Programmable Square-Wave Output\n♦Fast (400kHz) I\n2C Interface\n♦3.3V Operation\n♦Digital Temp Sensor Output: ±3°C Accuracy\n♦Register for Aging Trim\n♦RST Input/Output\n♦300-Mil, 20-Pin SO Package\n♦Underwriters Laboratories RecognizedExtremely Accurate I 2C RTC with \nIntegrated Crystal and SRAM\n19-5337; Rev 5; 7/10Ordering Information\nPART TEMP RANGE PIN-\nPACKAGE TOP  \nMARK \nDS3232S#    0°C to +70°C 20 SO DS3232 \nDS3232SN# -40°C to +85°C 20 SO DS3232N \nDS3232VCC\nSCLRPURPU = tR / CB\nRPU\nINT/SQW\n32kHz\nVBAT\nPUSH-\nBUTTON\nRESETSDA\nRST\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.VCC\nVCC\nGNDVCC\nμP\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.\nN.C.N.C.\nN.C.SCL\nRSTSDATypical Operating Circuit#Denotes a RoHS-compliant device that may include lead that\nis exempt under the RoHS requirements.

The TCXO pro-vides a stable and accurate reference clock, andmaintains the RTC to within ±2 minutes per year accu-racy from -40°C to +85°C. The TCXO frequency outputis available at the 32kHz pin. The RTC is a low-powerclock/calendar with two programmable time-of-dayalarms and a programmable square-wave output. TheINT/SQW provides either an interrupt signal due toalarm conditions or a square-wave output. The clock/cal-endar provides seconds, minutes, hours, day, date,month, and year information. The date at the end of themonth is automatically adjusted for months with fewerthan 31 days, including corrections for leap year.

No Connection. Not connected internally. Must be connected to ground.  \n3 32kHz 32kHz Push-Pull Output. If disabled with either EN32kHz = 0 or BB32kHz = 0, the state of the 32kHz pin \nwill be low. \n4 V CC DC Power Pin for Primary Power Supply. This pin should be decoupled using a 0.1μF to 1.0μF capacitor.  \n5 INT/SQW Active-Low Interrupt or Square-Wave Output. This open-drain pin requires an external pullup resistor. It can \nbe left open if not used. This multifunction pin is determined by the state of the INTCN bit in the Control \nRegister (0Eh). When INTCN is set to logic 0, this pin outputs a square wave and its frequency is \ndetermined by RS2 and RS1 bits. When INTCN is set to logic 1, then a match between the timekeeping \nregisters and either of the alarm registers activates the INT /SQW pin (if the alarm is enabled). Because the \nINTCN bit is set to logic 1 when power is first applied, the pin defaults to an interrupt output with alarms disabled. The pullup voltage can be up to 5.5V, regardless of the voltage on V\nCC. If not used, this pin can \nbe left unconnected. \n6 RSTActive-Low Reset. This pin is an open-drain input/output. It indicates the status of V CC relative to the  \nVPF specification. As V CC falls below V PF, the RST pin is driven low. When V CC exceeds V PF, for t RST, the \nRST pin is driven high impedance. The active-low, open-drain output is combined with a debounced \npushbutton input function. This pin can be activated by a pushbutton reset request. It has an internal 50k \x01\nnominal value pullup resistor to V CC. No external pullup resistors should be connected. If the crystal \noscillator is disabled, t RST is bypassed and RST  immediately goes high. \n15 GND Ground \n16 V BATBackup Power-Supply Input. When using the device with the V BAT input as the primary power source, this \npin should be decoupled using a 0.1μF to 1.0μF low-leakage capacitor. When using the device with the V\nBAT input as the backup power source, the capacitor is not required. If V BAT is not used, connect to \nground. The device is UL recognized to ensure against reverse charging when used with a primary lithium battery. Go to www.maxim-ic.com/qa/info/ul\n.\n17 SDA Serial-Data Input/Output. This pin is the data input/output for the I2C serial interface. This open-drain pin \nrequires an external pullup resistor. The pullup voltage can be up to 5.5V, regardless of the voltage on V CC.\n18, 20 SCL Serial-Clock Input. This pin is the clock input for the I2C serial interface and is used to synchronize data \nmovement on the serial interface. A connection to only one of the pins is required. The other pin must be \nconnected to the same signal or be left unconnected. Up to 5.5V can be used for this pin, regardless of the \nvoltage on V CC.\npower failures and to automatically switch to the back-\nup supply when necessary. The RST pin provides an\nexternal pushbutton function and acts as an indicator ofa power-fail event. Also available are 236 bytes of gen-eral-purpose battery-backed SRAM.\nOperation\nThe block diagram shows the main elements of theDS3232. The eight blocks can be grouped into fourfunctional groups: TCXO, power control, pushbuttonfunction, and RTC. Their operations are described sep-arately in the following sections.32kHz TCXO\nThe temperature sensor, oscillator, and control logicform the TCXO. The controller reads the output of theon-chip temperature sensor and uses a lookup table todetermine the capacitance required, adds the agingcorrection in AGE register, and then sets the capaci-tance selection registers. New values, includingchanges to the AGE register, are loaded only when achange in the temperature value occurs. The tempera-ture is read on initial application of V\nCCand once every\n64 seconds (default, see the description for CRATE1and CRATE0 in the control/status register) afterwards.\nDS3232 \n9\nMaxim Integrated\nPower Control\nThis function is provided by a temperature-compensat-\ned voltage reference and a comparator circuit thatmonitors the V\nCClevel. When V CCis greater than V PF,\nthe part is powered by V CC. When V CCis less than V PF\nbut greater than V BAT, the DS3232 is powered by V CC.\nIf VCCis less than V PFand is less than V BAT, the\ndevice is powered by V BAT. See Table 1.\nTo preserve the battery, the first time V BATis applied to\nthe device, the oscillator does not start up and no tem-perature conversions take place until V\nCCexceeds V PF\nor until a valid I2C address is written to the part. After\nthe first time V CCis ramped up, the oscillator starts up\nand the V BAT source powers the oscillator during\npower-down and keeps the oscillator running. Whenthe DS3232 switches to V\nBAT, the oscillator may be dis-\nabled by setting the EOSC bit.\nVBATOperation\nThere are several modes of operation that affect theamount of V\nBATcurrent that is drawn. While the device\nis powered by V BATand the serial interface is active,\nactive battery current, I BATA , is drawn. When the serial\ninterface is inactive, timekeeping current (I BATT ), which\nincludes the averaged temperature conversion current,I\nBATTC , is used (refer to Application Note 3644: Power\nConsiderations for Accurate Real-Time Clocks for\ndetails). Temperature conversion current, I BATTC , is\nspecified since the system must be able to support theperiodic higher current pulse and still maintain a validvoltage level. Data retention current, I\nBATTDR , is the\ncurrent drawn by the part when the oscillator isstopped (EOSC = 1). This mode can be used to mini-\nmize battery requirements for times when maintainingtime and date information is not necessary, e.g., whilethe end system is waiting to be shipped to a customer.\nPushbutton Reset Function\nThe DS3232 provides for a pushbutton switch to be con-nected to the RST output pin. When the DS3232 is not in\na reset cycle, it continuously monitors the RSTsignal for a\nlow going edge. If an edge transition is detected, theDS3232 debounces the switch by pulling the RST low.After the internal timer has expired (PB\nDB), the DS3232\ncontinues to monitor the RST line. If the line is still low, the\nDS3232 continuously monitors the line looking for a risingedge. Upon detecting release, the DS3232 forces theRSTpin low and holds it low for t\nRST.\nThe same pin, RST, is used to indicate a power-fail con-dition. When V\nCCis lower than V PF, an internal power-\nfail signal is generated, which forces the RST pin low.\nWhen V CCreturns to a level above V PF, the RST pin is\nheld low for t RECto allow the power supply to stabilize.\nIf the oscillator is not running (see the Power Control\nsection) when V CCis applied, t REC is bypassed and\nRST immediately goes high.\nAssertion of the RST output, whether by pushbutton or\npower-fail detection, does not affect the internal opera-tion of the DS3232.\nReal-Time Clock\nWith the clock source from the TCXO, the RTC providesseconds, minutes, hours, day, date, month, and yearinformation. The date at the end of the month is automati-cally adjusted for months with fewer than 31 days, includ-ing corrections for leap year. The clock operates in eitherthe 24-hour or 12-hour format with an AM/PM indicator.\nThe clock provides two programmable time-of-dayalarms and a programmable square-wave output. TheINT/SQW pin either generates an interrupt due to alarmcondition or outputs a square-wave signal and theselection is controlled by the bit INTCN.\nSRAM\nThe DS3232 provides 236 bytes of general-purposebattery-backed read/write memory. The I\n2C address\nranges from 14h to 0FFh. The SRAM can be written orread whenever V\nCCor V BAT is greater than the mini-\nmum operating voltage.\nAddress Map\nFigure 1 shows the address map for the DS3232 time-keeping registers. During a multibyte access, when theaddress pointer reaches the end of the register space(0FFh), it wraps around to location 00h. On an I\n2C\nSTART or address pointer incrementing to location 00h,the current time is transferred to a second set of regis-ters. The time information is read from these secondaryregisters, while the clock may continue to run. Thiseliminates the need to reread the registers in case themain registers update during a read.\nI2C Interface\nThe I 2C interface is accessible whenever either V CCor\nVBATis at a valid level.

Power Control\nDS3232      \n10\nMaxim Integrated\nevent, it is possible that the microcontroller and DS3232\nI2C communications could become unsynchronized,\ne.g., the microcontroller resets while reading data fromthe DS3232. When the microcontroller resets, theDS3232 I\n2C interface may be placed into a known state\nby toggling SCL until SDA is observed to be at a highlevel. At that point the microcontroller should pull SDAlow while SCL is high, generating a START condition.\nIf SCL is held low for greater than t\nIF, the internal I 2C\ninterface is reset. This limits the minimum frequency at\nwhich the I 2C interface can be operated. If data isbeing written to the device when the interface timeout isexceeded, prior to the acknowledge, the incompletebyte of data is not written.\nClock and Calendar\nThe time and calendar information is obtained by read-ing the appropriate register bytes. Figure 1 illustratesthe RTC registers. The time and calendar data are setor initialized by writing the appropriate register bytes.The contents of the time and calendar registers are inbinary-coded decimal (BCD) format. The DS3232 canbe run in either 12-hour or 24-hour mode. Bit 6 of theExtremely Accurate I 2C RTC with \nIntegrated Crystal and SRAM\nFigure 1.

When high, 12-hour mode is selected. In 12-\nhour mode, bit 5 is the AM/PM bit with logic-high beingPM. In 24-hour mode, bit 5 is the 20-hour bit (20–23hours). The century bit (bit 7 of the month register) istoggled when the years register overflows from 99 to 00.\nThe day-of-week register increments at midnight.\nValues that correspond to the day of week are user-defined but must be sequential (i.e., if 1 equalsSunday, then 2 equals Monday, and so on). Illogicaltime and date entries result in undefined operation.\nWhen reading or writing the time and date registers, sec-\nondary (user) buffers are used to prevent errors whenthe internal registers update. When reading the time anddate registers, the user buffers are synchronized to theinternal registers on any START and when the registerpointer rolls over to zero. The time information is readfrom these secondary registers, while the clock contin-ues to run. This eliminates the need to reread the regis-ters in case the main registers update during a read.\nThe countdown chain is reset whenever the seconds\nregister is written. Write transfers occur on the acknowl-edge from the DS3232. Once the countdown chain isreset, to avoid rollover issues the remaining time anddate registers must be written within 1 second. The 1Hzsquare-wave output, if enabled, transitions high 500msafter the seconds data transfer, provided the oscillatoris already running.Alarms\nThe DS3232 contains two time-of-day/date alarms. Alarm1 can be set by writing to registers 07h to 0Ah. Alarm 2can be set by writing to registers 0Bh to 0Dh. The alarmscan be programmed (by the alarm enable and INTCNbits of the control register) to activate the INT/SQW outputon an alarm match condition. Bit 7 of each of the time-of-day/date alarm registers are mask bits (Table 2). When allthe mask bits for each alarm are logic 0, an alarm onlyoccurs when the values in the timekeeping registersmatch the corresponding values stored in the time-of-day/date alarm registers. The alarms can also be pro-grammed to repeat every second, minute, hour, day, ordate. Table 2 shows the possible settings. Configurationsnot listed in the table result in illogical operation.\nThe DY/DT bits (bit 6 of the alarm day/date registers)\ncontrol whether the alarm value stored in bits 0 to 5 of\nthat register reflects the day of the week or the date ofthe month. If DY/ DTis written to logic 0, the alarm will\nbe the result of a match with date of the month. IfDY/DT is written to logic 1, the alarm will be the result of\na match with day of the week.\nWhen the RTC register values match alarm register set-\ntings, the corresponding Alarm Flag ‘A1F’ or ‘A2F’ bit isset to logic 1. If the corresponding Alarm InterruptEnable ‘A1IE’ or ‘A2IE’ is also set to logic 1 and theINTCN bit is set to logic 1, the alarm condition activatesthe INT/SQW signal. The match is tested on the once-\nper-second update of the time and date registers.Extremely Accurate I 2C RTC with \nIntegrated Crystal and SRAM\nTable 2.

When set to logic 0,\nthe oscillator is started. When set to logic 1, the oscilla-tor is stopped when the DS3232 switches to batterypower. This bit is clear (logic 0) when power is firstapplied. When the DS3232 is powered by V\nCC, the\noscillator is always on regardless of the status of theEOSC bit. When EOSC is disabled, all register data is\nstatic.\nBit 6: Battery-Backed Square-Wave Enable\n(BBSQW). When set to logic 1 with INTCN = 0 and V\nCC\n< VPF, this bit enables the square wave. When BBSQW\nis logic 0, the INT/SQW pin goes high impedance whenV\nCC< VPF. This bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is\nfirst applied.\nBit 5: Convert Temperature (CONV). Setting this bit to\n1 forces the temperature sensor to convert the temper-\nature into digital code and execute the TCXO algorithmto update the capacitance array to the oscillator. Thiscan only happen when a conversion is not already inprogress. The user should check the status bit BSYbefore forcing the controller to start a new TCXO exe-cution. A user-initiated temperature conversion doesnot affect the internal 64-second (default interval)update cycle.\nA user-initiated temperature conversion does not affect\nthe BSY bit for approximately 2ms. The CONV bitremains at a 1 from the time it is written until the conver-sion is finished, at which time both CONV and BSY goto 0. The CONV bit should be used when monitoringthe status of a user-initiated conversion.\nBits 4 and 3: Rate Select (RS2 and RS1). These bits\ncontrol the frequency of the square-wave output whenthe square wave has been enabled. The following table\nshows the square-wave frequencies that can be select-ed with the RS bits. These bits are both set to logic 1(8.192kHz) when power is first applied.\nBit 2: Interrupt Control (INTCN). This bit controls the\nINT/SQW signal. When the INTCN bit is set to logic 0, a\nsquare wave is output on the INT/SQW pin. When theINTCN bit is set to logic 1, a match between the time-keeping registers and either of the alarm registers acti-vates the INT/SQW (if the alarm is also enabled). Thecorresponding alarm flag is always set regardless ofthe state of the INTCN bit. The INTCN bit is set to logic1 when power is first applied.\nBit 1: Alarm 2 Interrupt Enable (A2IE). When set to\nlogic 1, this bit permits the alarm 2 flag (A2F) bit in the\nstatus register to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1).When the A2IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set tologic 0, the A2F bit does not initiate an interrupt signal.The A2IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power is firstapplied.\nBit 0: Alarm 1 Interrupt Enable (A1IE). When set to\nlogic 1, this bit permits the alarm 1 flag (A1F) bit in the\nstatus register to assert INT/SQW (when INTCN = 1).When the A1IE bit is set to logic 0 or INTCN is set tologic 0, the A1F bit does not initiate the INT/SQW sig-nal. The A1IE bit is disabled (logic 0) when power isfirst applied.Extremely Accurate I 2C RTC with \nIntegrated Crystal and SRAM\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: EOSC BBSQW CONV RS2 RS1 INTCN A2IE A1IE\nPOR*: 00011100\nRS2 RS1SQUARE-WAVE OUTPUT\nFREQUENCY\n0 0 1Hz\n0 1 1.024kHz\n1 0 4.096kHz\n1 1 8.192kHzSQUARE-WAVE OUTPUT FREQUENCYControl Register (0Eh)\n*POR is defined as the first application of power to the device, either V BATor VCC.\nDS3232 \nMaxim Integrated\n13\nControl/Status Register (0Fh)\nBit 7: Oscillator Stop Flag (OSF). A logic 1 in this bit\nindicates that the oscillator either is stopped or was\nstopped for some period and may be used to judge thevalidity of the timekeeping data. This bit is set to logic 1any time that the oscillator stops. The following areexamples of conditions that can cause the OSF bit tobe set:\n1) The first time power is applied.2) The voltages present on both V\nCCand V BAT are\ninsufficient to support oscillation.\n3) The EOSC bit is turned off in battery-backed mode.\n4) External influences on the crystal (i.e., noise, leak-\nage, etc.).\nThis bit remains at logic 1 until written to logic 0.Bit 6: Battery-Backed 32kHz Output (BB32kHz). This\nbit enables the 32kHz output when powered from V\nBAT\n(provided EN32kHz is enabled). If BB32kHz = 0, the\n32kHz output is low when the part is powered by V BAT.\nBits 5 and 4: Conversion Rate (CRATE1 andCRATE0). These two bits control the sample rate of the\nTCXO. The sample rate determines how often the tem-perature sensor makes a conversion and applies com-pensation to the oscillator. Decreasing the sample ratedecreases the overall power consumption by decreas-ing the frequency at which the temperature sensoroperates. However, significant temperature changesthat occur between samples may not be completelycompensated for, which reduce overall accuracy.When a new conversion rate is written to the register, itmay take up to the new conversion rate time before theconversions occur at the new rate.Bit 3: Enable 32kHz Output (EN32kHz). This bit indi-\ncates the status of the 32kHz pin. When set to logic 1,the 32kHz pin is enabled and outputs a 32.768kHzsquare-wave signal. When set to logic 0, the 32kHz pingoes low. The initial power-up state of this bit is logic 1,and a 32.768kHz square-wave signal appears at the32kHz pin after a power source is applied to the DS3232(if the oscillator is running).\nBit 2: Busy (BSY). This bit indicates the device is busy\nexecuting TCXO functions. It goes to logic 1 when the\nconversion signal to the temperature sensor is assertedand then is cleared when the conversion is complete.\nBit 1: Alarm 2 Flag (A2F). A logic 1 in the alarm 2 flag\nbit indicates that the time matched the alarm 2 regis-\nters. If the A2IE bit is logic 1 and the INTCN bit is set tologic 1, the INT/SQW pin is also asserted. A2F iscleared when written to logic 0. This bit can only bewritten to logic 0. Attempting to write to logic 1 leavesthe value unchanged.\nBit 0: Alarm 1 Flag (A1F). A logic 1 in the alarm 1 flag\nbit indicates that the time matched the alarm 1 regis-\nters. If the A1IE bit is logic 1 and the INTCN bit is set tologic 1, the INT/SQW pin is also asserted. A1F iscleared when written to logic 0. This bit can only bewritten to logic 0.

One LSB represents thesmallest capacitor to be switched in or out of thecapacitance array at the crystal pins. The aging offsetregister capacitance value is added or subtracted fromthe capacitance value that the device calculates foreach temperature compensation. The offset register isadded to the capacitance array during a normal tem-perature conversion, if the temperature changes fromthe previous conversion, or during a manual user con-version (setting the CONV bit). To see the effects of theaging register on the 32kHz output frequency immedi-ately, a manual conversion should be started after eachaging offset register change.\nPositive aging values add capacitance to the array,\nslowing the oscillator frequency. Negative valuesremove capacitance from the array, increasing theoscillator frequency.\nThe change in ppm per LSB is different at different\ntemperatures. The frequency vs. temperature curve isshifted by the values used in this register. At +25°C,one LSB typically provides about 0.1ppm change infrequency.\nUse of the aging register is not needed to achieve the\naccuracy as defined in the EC tables, but could beused to help compensate for aging at a given tempera-ture. See the \nTypical Operating Characteristics section\nfor a graph showing the effect of the register on accu-racy over temperature.\nTemperature Registers (11h–12h)\nTemperature is represented as a 10-bit code with a res-olution of 0.25°C and is accessible at location 11h and12h. The temperature is encoded in two’s complementformat, with bit 7 in the MSB representing the sign bit.The upper 8 bits, the integer portion, are at location 11hand the lower 2 bits, the fractional portion, are in theupper nibble at location 12h. For example,00011001 01b = +25.25°C. Upon power reset, the reg-isters are set to a default temperature of 0°C and thecontroller starts a temperature conversion.\nThe temperature is read on initial application of V\nCCor\nI2C access on V BATand once every 64 seconds after-\nwards. The temperature registers are updated after\neach user-initiated conversion and on every 64-secondconversion. The temperature registers are read-only.Extremely Accurate I 2C RTC with \nIntegrated Crystal and SRAM\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: SIGN DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA\nPOR*: 00000000Aging Offset (10h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: SIGN DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA DATA\nPOR*: 00000000Temperature Register (Upper Byte) (11h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: DATA DATA 0 0 0 0 0 0\nPOR*: 00000000Temperature Register (Lower Byte) (12h)\nBIT 7 BIT 6 BIT 5 BIT 4 BIT 3 BIT 2 BIT 1 BIT 0\nNAME: D7 D6 D5 D4 D3 D2 D1 D0\nPOR*: XXXXXXXXSRAM (14h–FFh)\n*POR is defined as the first application of power to the device, either V BATor VCC.\nDS3232 \nMaxim Integrated\n15\nI2C Serial Data Bus\nThe DS3232 supports a bidirectional I2C bus and data\ntransmission protocol. A device that sends data onto the\nbus is defined as a transmitter and a device receivingdata is defined as a receiver. The device that controls themessage is called a master. The devices that are con-trolled by the master are slaves. The bus must be con-trolled by a master device that generates the serial clock(SCL), controls the bus access, and generates the STARTand STOP conditions. The DS3232 operates as a slaveon the I\n2C bus. Connections to the bus are made through\nthe SCL input and open-drain SDA I/O lines. Within thebus specifications, a standard mode (100kHz maximumclock rate) and a fast mode (400kHz maximum clock rate)are defined. The DS3232 works in both modes.\nThe following bus protocol has been defined (Figure 2):• Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is\nnot busy.\n• During data transfer, the data line must remain stable\nwhenever the clock line is high. Changes in the data\nline while the clock line is high are interpreted ascontrol signals.\nAccordingly, the following bus conditions have beendefined:\nBus not busy: Both data and clock lines remain\nhigh.\nStart data transfer: A change in the state of the\ndata line from high to low, while the clock line is high,\ndefines a START condition.\nStop data transfer: A change in the state of the data\nline from low to high, while the clock line is high,\ndefines a STOP condition.Data valid: The state of the data line represents\nvalid data when, after a START condition, the dataline is stable for the duration of the high period of theclock signal. The data on the line must be changedduring the low period of the clock signal. There isone clock pulse per bit of data.\nEach data transfer is initiated with a START condition\nand terminated with a STOP condition. The numberof data bytes transferred between the START andthe STOP conditions is not limited, and is determinedby the master device. The information is transferredbyte-wise and each receiver acknowledges with aninth bit.\nAcknowledge: Each receiving device, when\naddressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge\nafter the reception of each byte. The master devicemust generate an extra clock pulse, which is associ-ated with this acknowledge bit.\nA device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA\nline during the acknowledge clock pulse in such away that the SDA line is stable low during the highperiod of the acknowledge-related clock pulse. Ofcourse, setup and hold times must be taken intoaccount. A master must signal an end of data to theslave by not generating an acknowledge bit on thelast byte that has been clocked out of the slave. Inthis case, the slave must leave the data line high toenable the master to generate the STOP condition.\nFigures 3 and 4 detail how data transfer is accom-plished on the I\n2C bus. Depending upon the state of\nthe R/W bit, two types of data transfer are possible:\nData transfer from a master transmitter to a slavereceiver.

At the end of the lastreceived byte, a not acknowledge is returned.\nThe master device generates all the serial clock puls-\nes and the START and STOP conditions. A transfer isended with a STOP condition or with a repeatedSTART condition. Since a repeated START conditionis also the beginning of the next serial transfer, thebus will not be released. Data is transferred with themost significant bit (MSB) first.Extremely Accurate I 2C RTC with \nIntegrated Crystal and SRAM\n...

Data Write/Read (Write Pointer, Then Read)—Slave Receive and Transmit\nDS3232 \nMaxim Integrated\n17\nThe DS3232 can operate in the following two modes:\nSlave receiver mode (DS3232 write mode): Serial\ndata and clock are received through SDA and SCL.\nAfter each byte is received, an acknowledge bit istransmitted. START and STOP conditions are recog-nized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer.Address recognition is performed by hardware afterreception of the slave address and direction bit. Theslave address byte is the first byte received after themaster generates the START condition. The slaveaddress byte contains the 7-bit DS3232 address,which is 1101000, followed by the direction bit (R/ W),\nwhich is 0 for a write. After receiving and decodingthe slave address byte, the DS3232 outputs anacknowledge on SDA. After the DS3232 acknowl-edges the slave address + write bit, the mastertransmits a word address to the DS3232. This setsthe register pointer on the DS3232, with the DS3232acknowledging the transfer. The master may thentransmit zero or more bytes of data, with the DS3232acknowledging each byte received. The registerpointer increments after each data byte is trans-ferred. The master generates a STOP condition toterminate the data write.\nSlave transmitter mode (DS3232 read mode): The\nfirst byte is received and handled as in the slave\nreceiver mode. However, in this mode, the directionbit indicates that the transfer direction is reversed.Serial data is transmitted on SDA by the DS3232while the serial clock is input on SCL. START andSTOP conditions are recognized as the beginningand end of a serial transfer. Address recognition isperformed by hardware after reception of the slaveaddress and direction bit. The slave address byte isthe first byte received after the master generates aSTART condition. The slave address byte containsthe 7-bit DS3232 address, which is 1101000, fol-lowed by the direction bit (R/ W), which is 1 for aread. After receiving and decoding the slaveaddress byte, the DS3232 outputs an acknowledgeon SDA. The DS3232 then begins to transmit datastarting with the register address pointed to by theregister pointer. If the register pointer is not written tobefore the initiation of a read mode, the first addressthat is read is the last one stored in the register point-er. The DS3232 must receive a not acknowledge toend a read.\nHandling, PC Board Layout,\nand Assembly\nThe DS3232 package contains a quartz tuning-forkcrystal. Pick-and-place equipment can be used, butprecautions should be taken to ensure that excessiveshocks are avoided. Exposure to reflow is limited to 2times maximum. Ultrasonic cleaning should be avoidedto prevent damage to the crystal.\nAvoid running signal traces under the package, unless\na ground plane is placed between the package and thesignal line.
