It provides internal operating current for both start-up and steady-state \noperation.  \nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION (BP/M) Pin:\nThis pin has multiple functions: \n1. It is the connection point for an external bypass capacitor for the internally generated 5.85 V supply.\n2. It is a mode selector for the current limit value, depending on the value of the capacitance added.  Use of a 0.1 mF capacitor results in the standard current limit value. Use of a \n1 mF capacitor results in the current limit being reduced to \nthat of the next smaller device size. Use of a 10 mF capacitor results in the current limit being increased to that of the next larger device size for TNY275-280.\n3. It provides a shutdown function. When the current into the bypass pin exceeds I\nSD, the device latches off until the  \nBP/M voltage drops below 4.9 V, during a power down. This can be used to provide an output overvoltage function with a \nZener connected from the BP/M pin to a bias winding supply. ENABLE/UNDERVOLTAGE (EN/UV) Pin:\nThis pin has dual functions: enable input and line undervoltage \nsense. During normal operation, switching of the power \nMOSFET is controlled by this pin.

The \nthreshold current is between 75 m A and 115 m A. \nThe EN/UV pin also senses line undervoltage conditions through an external resistor connected to the DC line voltage. If there is no external resistor connected to this pin, TinySwitch-III detects its absence and disables the line undervoltage function.\nSOURCE (S) Pin:\nThis pin is internally connected to the output MOSFET source for high-voltage power return and control circuit common.\nTinySwitch-III Functional Description\nTinySwitch-III combines a high-voltage power MOSFET switch with a power supply controller in one device. Unlike conventional PWM (pulse width modulator) controllers, it uses a simple  \nON/OFF control to regulate the output voltage. \nThe controller consists of an oscillator, enable circuit (sense and \nlogic), current limit state machine, 5.85 V regulator, BYPASS/\nMULTI-FUNCTION pin undervoltage, overvoltage circuit, and \ncurrent limit selection circuitry, over-temperature protection, current limit circuit, leading edge blanking, and a 700 V power MOSFET. TinySwitch-III incorporates additional circuitry for line undervoltage sense, auto-restart, adaptive switching cycle on-\ntime extension, and frequency jitter. Figure 2 shows the \nfunctional block diagram with the most important features.\nOscillator\nThe typical oscillator frequency is internally set to an average of \n132 kHz. Two signals are generated from the oscillator: the \nmaximum duty cycle signal (DC\nMAX) and the clock signal that \nindicates the beginning of each cycle.\nThe oscillator incorporates circuitry that introduces a small \namount of frequency jitter, typically 8 kHz peak-to-peak, to minimize EMI emission. The modulation rate of the frequency jitter is set to 1 kHz to optimize EMI reduction for both average \nand quasi-peak emissions. The frequency jitter should be measured with the oscilloscope triggered at the falling edge of \nthe DRAIN waveform. The waveform in Figure 4 illustrates the frequency jitter.\nEnable Input and Current Limit State Machine\nThe enable input circuit at the EN/UV pin consists of a low \nimpedance source follower output set at 1.2 V. The current \nthrough the source follower is limited to 115 mA. When the \ncurrent out of this pin exceeds the threshold current, a low logic level (disable) is generated at the output of the enable circuit, \nuntil the current out of this pin is reduced to less than the \nthreshold current. This enable circuit output is sampled at the beginning of each cycle on the rising edge of the clock signal. If high, the power MOSFET is turned on for that cycle (enabled). If low, the power MOSFET remains off (disabled). Since the \nsampling is done only at the beginning of each cycle, subsequent \nchanges in the EN/UV pin voltage or current during the remainder of the cycle are ignored.\nThe current limit state machine reduces the current limit by \ndiscrete amounts at light loads when TinySwitch-III is likely to switch in the audible frequency range. The lower current limit raises the effective switching frequency above the audio range and reduces the transformer flux density, including the \nassociated audible noise. The state machine monitors the \nsequence of enable events to determine the load condition and adjusts the current limit level accordingly in discrete amounts.\nUnder most operating conditions (except when close to no-\nload), the low impedance of the source follower keeps the voltage on the EN/UV pin from going much below 1.2 V in the disabled state. This improves the response time of the optocoupler that is usually connected to this pin.\n5.85 V Regulator and 6.4 V Shunt Voltage Clamp\nThe 5.85 V regulator charges the bypass capacitor connected to the BYPASS pin to 5.85 V by drawing a current from the voltage on the DRAIN pin whenever the MOSFET is off.  The \nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin is the internal supply voltage \nnode.  When the MOSFET is on, the device operates from the energy stored in the bypass capacitor. Extremely low power consumption of the internal circuitry allows TinySwitch-III to operate continuously from current it takes from the DRAIN pin. \nA bypass capacitor value of 0.1 m F is sufficient for both high \nfrequency decoupling and energy storage. \nIn addition, there is a 6.4 V shunt regulator clamping the \nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin at 6.4 V when current is \nprovided to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin through an external resistor. This facilitates powering of TinySwitch-III externally through a bias winding to decrease the no-load consumption to well below 50 mW.\nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION Pin Undervoltage\nThe BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin undervoltage circuitry disables the power MOSFET when the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin voltage drops below 4.9 V in steady state \noperation. Once the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin voltage \ndrops below 4.9 V in steady state operation, it must rise back to 5.85 V to enable (turn-on) the power MOSFET.\nFigure 4.

K 08/164\nTNY274-280\nwww.power.com  Over Temperature Protection\nThe thermal shutdown circuitry senses the die temperature.  \nThe threshold is typically set at 142 °C with 75 °C hysteresis. When the die temperature rises above this threshold the power \nMOSFET is disabled and remains disabled until the die \ntemperature falls by 75 °C, at which point it is re-enabled. A large hysteresis of 75 °C (typical) is provided to prevent over-heating of the PC board due to a continuous fault condition.\nCurrent Limit\nThe current limit circuit senses the current in the power MOSFET. When this current exceeds the internal threshold (I\nLIMIT), the power MOSFET is turned off for the remainder of that \ncycle. The current limit state machine reduces the current limit threshold by discrete amounts under medium and light loads.\nThe leading edge blanking circuit inhibits the current limit \ncomparator for a short time (t\nLEB) after the power MOSFET is \nturned on. This leading edge blanking time has been set so that current spikes caused by capacitance and secondary-side \nrectifier reverse recovery time will not cause premature \ntermination of the switching pulse.\nAuto-Restart\nIn the event of a fault condition such as output overload, output \nshort-circuit, or an open loop condition, TinySwitch-III enters \ninto auto-restart operation. An internal counter clocked by the oscillator is reset every time the EN/UV pin is pulled low. If the EN/UV pin is not pulled low for 64 ms, the power MOSFET switching is normally disabled for 2.5 seconds (except in the \ncase of line undervoltage condition, in which case it is disabled \nuntil the condition is removed). The auto-restart alternately enables and disables the switching of the power MOSFET until the fault condition is removed. Figure 5 illustrates auto-restart \ncircuit operation in the presence of an output short-circuit.\nIn the event of a line undervoltage condition, the switching of \nthe power MOSFET is disabled beyond its normal 2.5 seconds until the line undervoltage condition ends.Adaptive Switching Cycle On-Time Extension\nAdaptive switching cycle on-time extension keeps the cycle on \nuntil current limit is reached, instead of prematurely terminating after the DC\nMAX signal goes low. This feature reduces the \nminimum input voltage required to maintain regulation, extending hold-up time and minimizing the size of bulk capacitor required. \nThe on-time extension is disabled during the start-up of the \npower supply, until the power supply output reaches regulation.\nLine Undervoltage Sense Circuit\nThe DC line voltage can be monitored by connecting an \nexternal resistor from the DC line to the EN/UV pin.  During \npower up or when the switching of the power MOSFET is disabled in auto-restart, the current into the EN/UV pin must exceed 25 m A to initiate switching of the power MOSFET. During \npower up, this is accomplished by holding the BYPASS/MULTI-\nFUNCTION pin to 4.9 V while the line undervoltage condition \nexists. The BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin then rises from  4.9 V to 5.85 V when the line undervoltage condition goes away. When the switching of the power MOSFET is disabled in \nauto-restart mode and a line undervoltage condition exists, the \nauto-restart counter is stopped. This stretches the disable time beyond its normal 2.5 seconds until the line undervoltage condition ends.\nThe line undervoltage circuit also detects when there is no \nexternal resistor connected to the EN/UV pin (less than ~2 mA \ninto the pin). In this case the line undervoltage function is disabled.\nTinySwitch-III Operation\nTinySwitch-III devices operate in the current limit mode.  When enabled, the oscillator turns the power MOSFET on at the beginning of each cycle. The MOSFET is turned off when the \ncurrent ramps up to the current limit or when the DC\nMAX limit is \nreached. Since the highest current limit level and frequency of a \nTinySwitch-III design are constant, the power delivered to the \nload is proportional to the primary inductance of the transformer \nand peak primary current squared. Hence, designing the supply involves calculating the primary inductance of the transformer for the maximum output power required. If the TinySwitch-III is \nappropriately chosen for the power level, the current in the \ncalculated inductance will ramp up to current limit before the DC\nMAX limit is reached.\nEnable FunctionTinySwitch-III senses the EN/UV pin to determine whether or \nnot to proceed with the next switching cycle. The sequence of \ncycles is used to determine the current limit. Once a cycle is started, it always completes the cycle (even when the EN/UV pin changes state half way through the cycle). This operation \nresults in a power supply in which the output voltage ripple is \ndetermined by the output capacitor, amount of energy per switch cycle and the delay of the feedback.\nThe EN/UV pin signal is generated on the secondary by \ncomparing the power supply output voltage with a reference \nvoltage. The EN/UV pin signal is high when the power supply output voltage is less than the reference voltage.  \nFigure 5.

K 08/165\nTNY274-280\nwww.power.com  In a typical implementation, the EN/UV pin is driven by an \noptocoupler. The collector of the optocoupler transistor is \nconnected to the EN/UV pin and the emitter is connected to the SOURCE pin. The optocoupler LED is connected in series with \na Zener diode across the DC output voltage to be regulated. \nWhen the output voltage exceeds the target regulation voltage level (optocoupler LED voltage drop plus Zener voltage), the optocoupler LED will start to conduct, pulling the EN/UV pin \nlow. The Zener diode can be replaced by a TL431 reference \ncircuit for improved accuracy.ON/OFF Operation with Current Limit State MachineThe internal clock of the TinySwitch-III runs all the time. At the \nbeginning of each clock cycle, it samples the EN/UV pin to \ndecide whether or not to implement a switch cycle, and based on the sequence of samples over multiple cycles, it determines the appropriate current limit. At high loads, the state machine \nsets the current limit to its highest value. At lighter loads, the \nstate machine sets the current limit to reduced values. \nV\nDRAINVEN\nCLOCK\nDC\nDRAINIMAX\nPI-2749-082305\nFigure 6.

At slightly lower load, it will “skip” additional cycles in order to maintain voltage regulation at \nthe power supply output (Figure 7).  At medium loads, cycles \nwill be skipped and the current limit will be reduced (Figure 8). At very light loads, the current limit will be reduced even further (Figure 9). Only a small percentage of cycles will occur to satisfy the power consumption of the power supply.\nThe response time of the ON/OFF control scheme is very fast \ncompared to PWM control.  This provides tight regulation and excellent transient response. \nRev. K 08/167\nTNY274-280\nwww.power.com  Power Up/Down\nThe TinySwitch-III requires only a 0.1 m F capacitor on the \nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin to operate with standard \ncurrent limit. Because of its small size, the time to charge this \ncapacitor is kept to an absolute minimum, typically 0.6 ms. The \ntime to charge will vary in proportion to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin capacitor value when selecting different current limits. Due to the high bandwidth of the ON/OFF feedback, \nthere is no overshoot at the power supply output. When an \nexternal resistor (4 M W) is connected from the positive DC input \nto the EN/UV pin, the power MOSFET switching will be delayed during power up until the DC line voltage exceeds the threshold (100 V). Figures 10 and 11 show the power up timing waveform \nin applications with and without an external resistor (4 M W) \nconnected to the EN/UV pin.\nUnder start-up and overload conditions, when the conduction \ntime is less than 400 ns, the device reduces the switching \nfrequency to maintain control of the peak drain current.\nDuring power down, when an external resistor is used, the \npower MOSFET will switch for 64 ms after the output loses \nregulation. The power MOSFET will then remain off without any \nglitches since the undervoltage function prohibits restart when the line voltage is low. \nFigure 12 illustrates a typical power down timing waveform.  \nFigure 13 illustrates a very slow power down timing waveform as in standby applications. The external resistor (4 M W) is \nconnected to the EN/UV pin in this case to prevent unwanted restarts.\nNo bias winding is needed to provide power to the chip \nbecause it draws the power directly from the DRAIN pin (see Functional Description). This has two main benefits. First, for a nominal application, this eliminates the cost of a bias winding and associated components. Secondly, for battery charger applications, the current-voltage characteristic often allows the \noutput voltage to fall close to zero volts while still delivering \npower. TinySwitch-III accomplishes this without a forward bias winding and its many associated components. For applications that require very low no-load power consumption (50 mW), a \nresistor from a bias winding to the BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION \npin can provide the power to the chip. The minimum recommended current supplied is 1 mA. The BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin in this case will be clamped at 6.4 V. This method will eliminate the power draw from the DRAIN pin, \nthereby reducing the no-load power consumption and \nimproving full-load efficiency.\nCurrent Limit Operation\nEach switching cycle is terminated when the DRAIN current \nreaches the current limit of the device. Current limit operation \nprovides good line ripple rejection and relatively constant power delivery independent of input voltage.\nBYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION Pin Capacitor\nThe BYPASS/MULTI-FUNCTION pin can use a ceramic \ncapacitor as small as 0.1 m F for decoupling the internal power \nsupply of the device. A larger capacitor size can be used to \nadjust the current limit. For TNY275-280, a 1 m F BP/M pin \ncapacitor will select a lower current limit equal to the standard \ncurrent limit of the next smaller device and a 10 m F BP/M pin \ncapacitor will select a higher current limit equal to the standard \ncurrent limit of the next larger device. The higher current limit level of the TNY280 is set to 850 mA typical. The TNY274 MOSFET does not have the capability for increased current limit \nso this feature is not available in this device.\nRev. K 08/168\nTNY274-280\nwww.power.com  Applications Example\nThe circuit shown in Figure 14 is a low cost, high efficiency, \nflyback power supply designed for 12 V, 1 A output from universal input using the TNY278. \nThe supply features undervoltage lockout, primary sensed \noutput overvoltage latching shutdown protection, high efficiency (>80%), and very low no-load consumption (<50 mW \nat 265 VAC).  Output regulation is accomplished using a simple \nZener reference and optocoupler feedback.\nThe rectified and filtered input voltage is applied to the primary \nwinding of T1.  The other side of the transformer primary is \ndriven by the integrated MOSFET in U1.  Diode D5, C2, R1, R2, \nand VR1 comprise the clamp circuit, limiting the leakage inductance turn-off voltage spike on the DRAIN pin to a safe value.  The use of a combination a Zener clamp and parallel RC \noptimizes both EMI and energy efficiency.  Resistor R2 allows \nthe use of a slow recovery, low cost, rectifier diode by limiting the reverse current through D5.  The selection of a slow diode also improves efficiency and conducted EMI but should be a glass passivated type, with a specified recovery time of ≤ 2 ms.\nThe output voltage is regulated by the Zener diode VR3. When the output voltage exceeds the sum of the Zener and opto-coupler LED forward drop, current will flow in the optocoupler \nLED.  This will cause the transistor of the optocoupler to sink \ncurrent.When this current exceeds the ENABLE pin threshold current the next switching cycle is inhibited.  When the output voltage falls below the feedback threshold, a conduction cycle \nis allowed to occur and, by adjusting the number of enabled \ncycles, output regulation is maintained.  As the load reduces, the number of enabled cycles decreases, lowering the effective switching frequency and scaling switching losses with load.  \nThis provides almost constant efficiency down to very light \nloads, ideal for meeting energy efficiency requirements.\nAs the TinySwitch-III devices are completely self-powered, there \nis no requirement for an auxiliary or bias winding on the \ntransformer.  However by adding a bias winding, the output \novervoltage protection feature can be configured, protecting the load against open feedback loop faults.\nWhen an overvoltage condition occurs, such that bias voltage \nexceeds the sum of VR2 and the BYPASS/MULTIFUNCTION (BP/M)  pin voltage (28 V+5.85 V), current begins to flow into the  \nBP/M pin.  When this current exceeds I\nSD the internal latching \nshutdown circuit in TinySwitch-III is activated.  This condition is reset when the BP/M pin voltage drops below 2.6 V after \nremoval of the AC input. In the example shown, on opening the \nloop, the OVP trips at an output of 17 V.\nFor lower no-load input power consumption, the bias winding \nmay also be used to supply the TinySwitch-III device.  Resistor \nR8 feeds current into the BP/M pin, inhibiting the internal high-voltage current source that normally maintains the BP/M pin capacitor voltage (C7) during the internal MOSFET off time.  This reduces the no-load consumption of this design from  \n140 mW to 40 mW at 265 VAC.Figure 14.

When present, switching is inhibited until the current in the EN/UV pin exceeds 25 \nmA.  This \nallows the start-up voltage to be programmed within the normal operating input voltage range, preventing glitching of the output \nunder abnormal low voltage conditions and also on removal of \nthe AC input. \nIn addition to the simple input pi filter (C1, L1, C2) for differential \nmode EMI, this design makes use of E-Shield™ shielding \ntechniques in the transformer to reduce common mode EMI displacement currents, and R2 and C4 as a damping network to reduce high frequency transformer ringing.  These techniques, combined with the frequency jitter of TNY278, give \nexcellent conducted and radiated EMI performance with this \ndesign achieving >12 dB\nmV of margin to EN55022 Class B \nconducted EMI limits.\nFor design flexibility the value of C7 can be selected to pick one \nof the 3 current limits options in U1.  This allows the designer to select the current limit appropriate for the application.  \n• Standard current limit (ILIMIT) is selected with a 0.1 mF BP/M pin \ncapacitor and is the normal choice for typical enclosed adapter applications.\n• When a 1 mF BP/M pin capacitor is used, the current limit is reduced (I\nLIMITred or ILIMIT-1) offering reduced RMS device \ncurrents and therefore improved efficiency, but at the expense of maximum power capability.  This is ideal for thermally \nchallenging designs where dissipation must be minimized.\n• When a 10 mF BP/M pin capacitor is used, the current limit is \nincreased (ILIMITinc or ILIMIT+1), extending the power capability for \napplications requiring higher peak power or continuous power where the thermal conditions allow.\nFurther flexibility comes from the current limits between adjacent TinySwitch-III family members being compatible.  The reduced current limit of a given device is equal to the standard \ncurrent limit of the next smaller device and the increased \ncurrent limit is equal to the standard current limit of the next larger device.\nKey Application Considerations\nTinySwitch-lll Design Considerations\nOutput Power Table\nThe data sheet output power table (Table 1) represents the \nminimum practical continuous output power level that can be \nobtained under the following assumed conditions:\n1. The minimum DC input voltage is 100 V or higher for 85 VAC input, or 220 V or higher for 230 VAC input or 115 VAC with a voltage doubler.  The value of the input capacitance should \nbe sized to meet these criteria for AC input designs.\n2. Efficiency of 75%.\n3. Minimum data sheet value of I2f.\n4. Transformer primary inductance tolerance of ±10%.\n5. Reflected output voltage (VOR) of 135 V.\n6. Voltage only output of 12 V with a fast PN rectifier diode.\n7. Continuous conduction mode operation with transient KP* \nvalue of 0.25.8. Increased current limit is selected for peak and open frame \npower columns and standard current limit for adapter columns.\n9. The part is board mounted with SOURCE pins soldered to a sufficient area of copper and/or a heatsink is used to keep the SOURCE pin temperature at or below 110 °C.\n10. Ambient temperature of 50 °C for open frame designs and  \n40 °C for sealed adapters.\n*Below a value of 1, KP is the ratio of ripple to peak primary \ncurrent.  To prevent reduced power capability due to premature termination of switching cycles a transient K\nP limit of ≥0.25 is \nrecommended.  This prevents the initial current limit (IINIT) from \nbeing exceeded at MOSFET turn on.\nFor reference, Table 2 provides the minimum practical power  \ndelivered from each family member at the three selectable current limit values.  This assumes open frame operation (not thermally limited) and otherwise the same conditions as listed \nabove.  These numbers are useful to identify the correct current \nlimit to select for a given device and output power requirement.\nOvervoltage Protection\nThe output overvoltage protection provided by TinySwitch-III uses an internal latch that is triggered by a threshold current of \napproximately 5.5 mA into the BP/M pin.  In addition to an \ninternal filter, the BP/M pin capacitor forms an external filter providing noise immunity from inadvertent triggering. For the bypass capacitor to be effective as a high frequency filter, the \ncapacitor should be located as close as possible to the \nSOURCE and BP/M pins of the device.\nFor best performance of the OVP function, it is recommended \nthat a relatively high bias winding voltage is used, in the range of 15 V – 30 V.  This minimizes the error voltage on the bias winding due to leakage inductance and also ensures adequate \nvoltage during no-load operation from which to supply the  \nBP/M pin for reduced no-load consumption.\nSelecting the Zener diode voltage to be approximately 6 V \nabove the bias winding voltage (28 V for 22 V bias winding) \ngives good OVP performance for most designs, but can be adjusted to compensate for variations in leakage inductance.  Adding additional filtering can be achieved by inserting a low Table 2.   Minimum Practical Power at Three Selectable Current Limit Levels.\nRev. K 08/1610\nTNY274-280\nwww.power.com  value (10 W to 47 W) resistor in series with the bias winding \ndiode and/or the OVP Zener as shown by R7 and R3 in  \nFigure 14.  The resistor in series with the OVP Zener also limits \nthe maximum current into the BP/M pin.\nReducing No-load Consumption\nAs TinySwitch-III is self-powered from the BP/M pin capacitor, there is no need for an auxiliary or bias winding to be provided \non the transformer for this purpose.  Typical no-load \nconsumption when self-powered is <150 mW at 265 VAC input.  The addition of a bias winding can reduce this down to <50 mW by supplying the TinySwitch-III from the lower bias voltage and inhibiting the internal high-voltage current source.  To achieve \nthis, select the value of the resistor (R8 in Figure 14) to provide \nthe data sheet DRAIN supply current.  In practice, due to the reduction of the bias voltage at low load, start with a value equal to 40% greater than the data sheet maximum current, \nand then increase the value of the resistor to give the lowest no-\nload consumption.\nAudible Noise\nThe cycle skipping mode of operation used in TinySwitch-III can generate audio frequency components in the transformer.  To \nlimit this audible noise generation the transformer should be \ndesigned such that the peak core flux density is below  \n3000 Gauss (300 mT).  Following this guideline and using the standard transformer production technique of dip varnishing \npractically eliminates audible noise.  Vacuum impregnation of \nthe transformer should not be used due to the high primary capacitance and increased losses that result. Higher flux densities are possible, however careful evaluation of the audible noise performance should be made using production \ntransformer samples before approving the design.  \nCeramic capacitors that use dielectrics such as Z5U, when \nused in clamp circuits, may also generate audio noise.  If this is \nthe case, try replacing them with a capacitor having a different \ndielectric or construction, for example a film type.\nTinySwitch-lll Layout ConsiderationsLayout\nSee Figure 15 for a recommended circuit board layout for \nTinySwitch-III.\nSingle Point Grounding\nUse a single point ground connection from the input filter capacitor to the area of copper connected to the SOURCE pins.\nBypass Capacitor (C\nBP)\nThe BP/M pin capacitor should be located as near as possible \nto the BP/M and SOURCE pins.\nEN/UV Pin\nKeep traces connected to the EN/UV pin short and, as far as is practical, away from all other traces and nodes above source potential including, but not limited to, the BYPASS and DRAIN \npins.\nPrimary Loop Area\nThe area of the primary loop that connects the input filter capacitor, transformer primary and TinySwitch-III together \nshould be kept as small as possible.\nPrimary Clamp Circuit\nA clamp is used to limit peak voltage on the DRAIN pin at turn off.  This can be achieved by using an RCD clamp or a Zener \n(~200 V) and diode clamp across the primary winding.  In all \ncases, to minimize EMI, care should be taken to minimize the circuit path from the clamp components to the transformer and TinySwitch-III.\nThermal Considerations\nThe four SOURCE pins are internally connected to the IC lead \nframe and provide the main path to remove heat from the device.  Therefore all the SOURCE pins should be connected to a copper area underneath the TinySwitch-III to act not only as a \nsingle point ground, but also as a heat sink.  As this area is \nconnected to the quiet source node, this area should be maximized for good heat sinking.  Similarly for axial output diodes, maximize the PCB area connected to the cathode.\nY-Capacitor\nThe placement of the Y capacitor should be directly from the \nprimary input filter capacitor positive terminal to the common/return terminal of the transformer secondary.  Such a placement will route high magnitude common mode surge currents away \nfrom the TinySwitch-III device.  Note – if an input π (C, L, C) EMI \nfilter is used then the inductor in the filter should be placed between the negative terminals of the input filter capacitors.\nOptocoupler\nPlace the optocoupler physically close to the TinySwitch-III to \nminimizing the primary-side trace lengths.  Keep the high \ncurrent, high-voltage drain and clamp traces away from the optocoupler to prevent noise pick up.\nOutput Diode\nFor best performance, the area of the loop connecting the \nsecondary winding, the output diode and the output filter capacitor, should be minimized.  In addition, sufficient copper area should be provided at the anode and cathode terminals of the diode for heat sinking.  A larger area is preferred at the quiet \ncathode terminal.  A large anode area can increase high \nfrequency radiated EMI.\nPC Board Leakage Currents\nTinySwitch-III is designed to optimize energy efficiency across \nthe power range and particularly in standby/no-load conditions.  \nCurrent consumption has therefore been minimized to achieve this performance.  The EN/UV pin undervoltage feature for example has a low threshold (~1 m A) to detect whether an \nundervoltage resistor is present. \nParasitic leakage currents into the EN/UV pin are normally well \nbelow this 1 m A threshold when PC board assembly is in a well \ncontrolled production facility.   However, high humidity \nconditions together with board and/or package contamination, \neither from no-clean flux or other contaminants, can reduce the surface resistivity enough to allow parasitic currents >1 m A to \nflow into the EN/UV pin.  These currents can flow from higher voltage exposed solder pads close to the EN/UV pin such as \nRev. K 08/1611\nTNY274-280\nwww.power.com  the BP/M pin solder pad preventing the design from starting up.  \nDesigns that make use of the undervoltage lockout feature by \nconnecting a resistor from the high-voltage rail to the EN/UV pin are not affected.\nIf the contamination levels in the PC board assembly facility are \nunknown, the application is open frame or operates in a high pollution degree environment and the design does not make \nuse of the undervoltage lockout feature, then an optional  \n390 kW resistor should be added from EN/UV pin to SOURCE \npin to ensure that the parasitic leakage current into the EN/UV \npin is well below 1 m A.\nNote that typical values for surface insulation resistance (SIR) where no-clean flux has been applied according to the suppliers’ guidelines are >>10 M W and do not cause this issue.\nQuick Design Checklist\nAs with any power supply design, all TinySwitch-III  designs \nshould be verified on the bench to make sure that component \nspecifications are not exceeded under worst case conditions.  The following minimum set of tests is strongly recommended:\n1. Maximum drain voltage – Verify that VDS does not exceed \n650 V at highest input voltage and peak (overload) output power.  The 50 V margin to the 700 V BV\nDSS specification \ngives margin for design variation.Figure 15.

Maximum drain current – At maximum ambient temperature, \nmaximum input voltage and peak output (overload) power, verify drain current waveforms for any signs of transformer \nsaturation and excessive leading edge current spikes at \nstart-up.  Repeat under steady state conditions and verify that the leading edge current spike event is below I\nLIMIT(MIN) at \nthe end of the tLEB(MIN).  Under all conditions, the maximum \ndrain current should be below the specified absolute maximum ratings.\n3. Thermal Check – At specified maximum output power, minimum input voltage and maximum ambient temperature, verify that the temperature specifications are not exceeded \nfor TinySwitch-III, transformer, output diode, and output \ncapacitors.  Enough thermal margin should be allowed for part-to-part variation of the R\nDS(ON) of TinySwitch-III as \nspecified in the data sheet.  Under low line, maximum power, a maximum TinySwitch-III SOURCE pin temperature of  \n110 °C is recommended to allow for these variations.\nDesign Tools\nUp-to-date information on design tools is available at the Power \nIntegrations website: www.power.com.\nRev.

Total device consumption at no-load is the sum of IS1 and IDSS2.\nB. Since the output MOSFET is switching, it is difficult to isolate the switching current from the supply current at the DRAIN.   \nAn alternative is to measure the BP/M pin current at 6.1 V.\nC. BP/M pin is not intended for sourcing supply current to external circuitry.\nD. To ensure correct current limit it is recommended that nominal 0.1 mF / 1 mF / 10 mF capacitors are used. In addition, the BP/M capacitor value tolerance should be equal or better than indicated below across the ambient temperature range of the target application. The minimum and maximum capacitor values are guaranteed by characterization. \n \n   \n \n    \nE. For current limit at other di/dt values, refer to Figure 23.\nF. TNY274 does not set an increased current limit value, but with a 10 mF BP/M pin capacitor the current limit is the same as with a 1 mF BP/M pin capacitor (reduced current limit value).\nG. This parameter is derived from characterization.\nH. This parameter is derived from the change in current limit measured at 1X and 4X of the di/dt shown in the ILIMIT specification.\nI. IDSS1 is the worst-case OFF-state leakage specification at 80% of BVDSS and maximum operating junction temperature. IDSS2 is a \ntypical specification under worst-case application conditions (rectified 265 VAC) for no-load consumption calculations.\nJ. Breakdown voltage may be checked against minimum BVDSS specification by ramping the DRAIN pin voltage up to but not \nexceeding minimum BVDSS.\nK. Auto-restart on time has the same temperature characteristics as the oscillator (inversely proportional to frequency).Nominal BP/M \nPin Cap ValueTolerance Relative to Nominal \nCapacitor Value\nMin Max\n0.1 mF -60% +100%\n1 mF -50% +100%\n10 mF -50% NA\nRev.
