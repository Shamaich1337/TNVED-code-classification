G | Page 7 of 19 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION \nThe AD7414/AD7415 are standalone digital temperature \nsensors. The on-chip temperature sensor allows an accurate \nmeasurement of the ambient device temperature to be made. The 10-bit analog-to-digital converter converts the temperature \nmeasured into a twos complement format for storage in the \ntemperature register. The ADC is made up of a conventional successive-approximation converter based around a capacitor digital-to-analog (DAC). The serial interface is I\n2C-and SMBus- \ncompatible. The AD7414/AD7415 require a 2.7 V to 5.5 V power supply. The temperature sensor has a working measurement range of −40°C to +125°C. \nFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION \nTemperature measurement is initiated by two methods. The \nfirst uses an internal clock countdown of 800 ms, and a \nconversion is performed. The internal oscillator is the only circuit that is powered up between conversions, and once it times out, every 800 ms, a wake-up signal is sent to power up the rest of the circuitry. A monostable is activated at the \nbeginning of the wake-up signal to ensure that sufficient time is \ngiven to the power-up process. The monostable typically takes 4 μs to time out. It then takes typically 25 μs for each conversion \nto be completed. The new temperature value is loaded into the temperature value register and ready for reading by the I\n2C \ninterface. \nA temperature measurement is also initiated every time the \none-shot method is used. This method requires the user to \nwrite to the one-shot bit in the configuration register when a temperature measurement is needed. Setting the one-shot bit to 1 starts a temperature conversion directly after the write operation. The track-and-hold goes into hold approximately \n4 μs (monostable time out) after the STOP condition, and a \nconversion is then initiated. Typically 25 μs later, the conversion is complete and the temperature value register is loaded with a \nnew temperature value. \nThe measurement modes are compared with a high tempera-\nture limit, stored in an 8-bit read/write register. This is applica-ble only to the AD7414, because the AD7415 does not have an \nALERT pin and subsequently does not have an overtemperature \nmonitoring function. If the measurement is greater than the high limit, the ALERT pin is activated (if it has already been enabled in the configuration register). There are two ways to deactivate the ALERT pin again: when the alert reset bit in the configuration register is set to 1 by a write operation, and when \nthe temperature measured is less than the value in the T\nLOW register. \nThis ALERT pin is compatible with the SMBus SMBALERT \noption.

Typical Connection Diagram \nMEASUREMENT TECHNIQUE \nA common method of measuring temperature is to exploit the \nnegative temperature coefficient of a diode, or the base-emitter \nvoltage of a transistor, operated at constant current. Unfortunately, this technique requires calibration to null the \neffect of the absolute value of V\nBE, which varies from device to \ndevice. The technique used in the AD7414/AD7415 is to \nmeasure the change in V BE when the device is operated at two \ndifferent currents. This is given by \n\uf028\uf029N ln q KT VBE \uf0b4\uf03d\uf044  \nwhere: \nK is Boltzmann’s constant. \nq is the charge on the electron (1.6 × 10–19 Coulombs). \nT is the absolute temperature in Kelvins. \nN is the ratio of the two currents. \n \n \nVDD\nVOUT+\nVOUT–TO ADC\nSENSING\nTRANSISTORSENSING\nTRANSISTORII \uf0b4N\n02463-007 \nFigure 7. Temperature Measurement Technique \nAD7414/ AD7415 Data Sheet\n \nRev. G | Page 8 of 19 Figure 7 shows the method the AD7414/AD7415 used to \nmeasure the ambient device temperature. To measure ΔV BE,  \nthe sensor (substrate transistor) is switched between operating currents of I and N × I. The resulting waveform is passed \nthrough a chopper stabilized amplifier that performs the \nfunctions of amplification and rectification of the waveform to produce a dc voltage proportional to ΔV\nBE. This voltage is \nmeasured by the ADC to give a temperature output in 10-bit, \ntwos complement format. \nTEMPERATURE DATA FORMAT \nThe temperature resolution of the ADC is 0.25°C, which \ncorresponds to 1 LSB of the ADC. The ADC can theoretically \nmeasure a temperature span of 255°C; the lowest practical value \nis limited to −40°C due to the device maximum ratings. The \nA grade can measure a temperature range of −40°C to +125°C \n(temperature data format is shown in Table 5). Table 5.

In the \nAD7414, six of the MSBs are used (D7 to D2) to set the operating \nmodes (see Table 10). D0 and D1 are used for factory settings and must have zeros written to them during normal operation. \nTable 10.

G | Page 10 of 19 In the AD7415, only three of the bits are used (D7, D6, and D2) \nto set the operating modes (see Table 12). D0, D1, and D3 to D5 \nare used for factory settings and must have zeros written to \nthem during normal operation. \nTable 12. AD7415 Configuration Register Settings \nD7 Full power-down if = 1. \nD6 Bypass SDA and SCL filtering if = 0. \nD2 Initiate a one-shot temperature conversion if set to 1. \nThe bit status is not stored; thus this bit is 0 if read. \n \nIf the AD7414/AD7415 are in power-down mode (D7 = 1), a \ntemperature conversion can still be initiated by the one-shot \noperation. This involves a write operation to the configuration register and setting the one-shot bit to 1 (D2 = 1), which causes the AD7414/AD7415 to power up, perform a single conversion, \nand power down again. This is a very power efficient mode. \nTEMPERATURE VALUE REGISTER (ADDRESS 0 X00) \nThe temperature value register is a 10-bit, read-only register \nthat stores the temperature reading from the ADC in twos \ncomplement format. Two reads are necessary to read data from \nthis register. Table 13 shows the contents of the first byte to be read, while Table 14 and Table 15 show the contents of the second byte to be read from the AD7414 and AD7415, respectively. In Table 14, D3 to D5 of the second byte are used \nas flag bits and are obtained from other internal registers. They \nfunction as follows: \nALERT_Flag: The state of this bit is the same as that of the \nALERT pin. \nT\nHIGH_Flag: This flag is set to 1 when the temperature \nmeasured goes above the T HIGH limit. It is reset \nwhen the second temperature byte (Table 14) is \nread. If the temperature is still greater than the \nTHIGH limit after the read operation, the flag is again. \nTLOW_Flag: This flag is set to 1 when the temperature \nmeasured goes below the T LOW limit. It is reset \nwhen the second temperature byte (Table 14) is \nread. If the temperature is still less than the T LOW \nlimit after the read operation, the flag is set again. \nThe full theoretical span of the ADC is 255°C, but in practice the temperature measurement range is limited to the operating \nrange of the device, −40°C to +125°C for the A grade.

G | Page 12 of 19 SERIAL INTERFACE \nControl of the AD7414/AD7415 is carried out via the I2C-\ncompatible serial bus. The AD7414/AD7415 are connected to \nthis bus as slave device, under the control of a master device, \nsuch as the processor. \nSERIAL BUS ADDRESS \nLike all I2C-compatible devices, the AD7414/AD7415 have a \n7-bit serial address. The four MSBs of this address for the \nAD7414/AD7415 are set to 1001. The AD7414/AD7415 are \navailable in four versions: AD7414/AD7415-0, AD7414/ AD7415-1, AD7414-2, and AD7414-3. The first two versions have three different I\n2C addresses available, which are selected \nby either tying the AS pin to GND, to V DD, or letting the pin \nfloat (see Table 4). By giving different addresses for the four \nversions, up to eight AD7414s or six AD7415s can be connected \nto a single serial bus, or the addresses can be set to avoid \nconflicts with other devices on the bus. \nThe serial bus protocol operates as follows. \nThe master initiates data transfer by establishing a START \ncondition, defined as a high-to-low transition on the serial data line SDA, while the serial clock line SCL remains high. This indicates that an address/data stream follows. All slave periph-\nerals connected to the serial bus respond to the START condi-\ntion and shift in the next eight bits, consisting of a 7-bit address \n(MSB first) plus an R/ W\n bit, which determines the direction of \nthe data transfer and whether data is written to or read from the slave device. \nThe peripheral whose address corresponds to the transmitted \naddress responds by pulling the data line low during the low period before the ninth clock pulse, known as the acknowledge bit. All other devices on the bus remain idle while the selected device \nwaits for data to be read from or written to it. If the R/ W\n bit is 0, \nthe master writes to the slave device. If the R/ W bit is 1, the \nmaster reads from the slave device. \nData is sent over the serial bus in sequences of nine clock \npulses, eight bits of data followed by an acknowledge bit from the receiver of data. Transitions on the data line must occur during the low period of the clock signal and remain stable \nduring the high period, because a low-to-high transition when \nthe clock is high may be interpreted as a STOP signal. \nWhen all data bytes have been read or written, stop conditions \nare established. In WRITE mode, the master pulls the data line high during the 10th clock pulse to assert a STOP condition. In READ mode, the master device pulls the data line high during the low period before the ninth clock pulse. This is known as \nNo Acknowledge. The master then takes the data line low \nduring the low period before the 10th clock pulse, then high \nduring the 10th clock pulse to assert a STOP condition. \n Any number of bytes of data may be transferred over the serial \nbus in one operation, but it is not possible to mix read and write in one operation. The type of operation is determined at the beginning and cannot then be changed without starting a new operation. \nWRITE MODE \nDepending on the register being written to, there are two different writes for the AD7414/AD7415. \nWriting to the Address Pointer Register for a Subsequent \nRead \nIn order to read data from a particular register, the address \npointer register must contain the address of that register. If it \ndoes not, the correct address must be written to the address pointer register by performing a single-byte write operation, as shown in Figure 10. The write operation consists of the serial \nbus address followed by the address pointer byte. No data is \nwritten to any of the data registers. A read operation is then \nperformed to read the register. \nWriting a Single Byte of Data to the Configuration \nRegister, T HIGH Register, or T LOW Register \nAll three registers are 8-bit registers, so only one byte of data \ncan be written to each register. Writing a single byte of data to \none of these registers consists of the serial bus address, the data \nregister address written to the address pointer register, followed by the data byte written to the selected data register. This is \nillustrated in Figure 11. \nREAD MODE \nReading data from the AD7414/AD7415 is a 1- or 2-byte \noperation. Reading back the contents of the configuration \nregister, the T HIGH register, or the T LOW register is a single-byte \nread operation, as shown in Figure 12. The register address was previously set up by a single-byte write operation to the address pointer register. Once the register address has been set up, any number of reads can subsequently be performed from that register without having to write to the address pointer register \nagain. To read from another register, the address pointer register \nhas to be written to again to set up the relevant register address. \nReading data from the temperature value register is a 2-byte \noperation, as shown in Figure 13. The same rules apply for a \n2-byte read as a 1-byte read. \nData Sheet AD7414 /AD7415\n \nRev. G | Page 13 of 19 SMBUS ALERT \nThe AD7414 ALERT output is an SMBus interrupt line for \ndevices that want to trade their ability to master for an extra \npin. The AD7414 is a slave-only device and uses the SMBus ALERT to signal to the host device that it wants to talk. The \nSMBus ALERT on the AD7414 is used as an overtemperature \nindicator. \nThe ALERT pin has an open-drain configuration that allows the \nALERT outputs of several AD7414s to be wire-AND’ ed together when the ALERT pin is active low. Use D4 of the configuration register to set the active polarity of the ALERT output. The power-up default is active low. The ALERT function can be disabled or enabled by setting D5 of the configuration register to 1 or 0, respectively. \nThe host device can process the ALERT interrupt and \nsimultaneously access all SMBus ALERT devices through the alert response address. Only the device that pulled the ALERT low acknowledges the Alert Response Address (ARA). If more than one device pulls the ALERT pin low, the highest priority (lowest address) device wins communication rights via standard I\n2C arbitration during the slave address transfer. \nThe ALERT output becomes active when the value in the temper-ature value register exceeds the value in the T\nHIGH register. It is \nreset when a write operation to the configuration register sets D3 to 1 or when the temperature falls below the value stored in \nthe T\nLOW register. \nThe ALERT output requires an external pull-up resistor. This \ncan be connected to a voltage different from V DD, provided the \nmaximum voltage rating of the ALERT output pin is not exceeded. The value of the pull-up resistor depends on the application, but it should be as large as possible to avoid excessive sink currents at the ALERT output, which can heat the \nchip and affect the temperature reading. \nPOWER-ON DEFAULTS \nThe AD7414/AD7415 always power up with these defaults: \nAddress pointer register pointing to the temperature value \nregister. \nTHIGH register loaded with 7Fh. \nTLOW register loaded with 80h. \nConfiguration register loaded with 40h. \nNote that the AD7415 does not have any T HIGH or T LOW registers. OPERATING MODES \nMode 1 \nThis is the power-on default mode of the AD7414/AD7415. In \nthis mode, the AD7414/AD7415 does a temperature conversion \nevery 800 ms and then partially powers down until the next conversion occurs. \nIf a one-shot operation (setting D2 of the configuration register \nto a 1) is performed between automatic conversions, a conver-\nsion is initiated right after the write operation. After this \nconversion, the part returns to performing a conversion every \n800 ms. \nDepending on where a serial port access occurs during a \nconversion, that conversion might be aborted. If the conversion \nis completed before the part recognizes a serial port access, the \ntemperature register is updated with the new conversion. If the conversion is completed after the part recognizes a serial port \naccess, the internal logic prevents the temperature register from \nbeing updated, because corrupt data could be read. \nA temperature conversion can start anytime during a serial port \naccess (other than a one-shot operation), but the result of that \nconversion is loaded into the temperature register only if the serial port access is not active at the end of the conversion. \nMode 2 \nThe only other mode in which the AD7414/AD7415 operates is \nthe full power-down mode. This mode is usually used when \ntemperature measurements are required at a very slow rate. The power consumption of the part can be greatly reduced in this \nmode by writing to the part to go to a full power-down. Full \npower-down is initiated right after D7 of the configuration register is set to 1. \nWhen a temperature measurement is required, a write \noperation can be performed to power up the part and put it into \none-shot mode (setting D2 of the configuration register to a 1). \nThe power-up takes approximately 4 \uf06ds. The part then performs \na conversion and is returned to full power-down. The \ntemperature value can be read in the full power-down mode, \nbecause the serial interface is still powered up. \nAD7414/ AD7415 Data Sheet\n \nRev. G | Page 14 of 19 POWER VS. THROUGHPUT \nThe two modes of operation for the AD7414/AD7415 produce \ndifferent power vs. throughput performances. Mode 2 is the \nsleep mode of the part, and it achieves the optimum power \nperformance. \nMode 1 \nIn this mode, continuous conversions are performed at a rate of \napproximately one every 800 ms. Figure 14 shows the times and \ncurrents involved with this mode of operation for a 5 V supply. At 5 V , the current consumption for the part when converting is typically 1.1 mA, and the quiescent current is typically 188 μA. \nThe conversion time of 25 μs plus the power-up time of \ntypically 4 μs contributes 199.3 nW to the overall power \ndissipation in the following way: \n(29 μs /800 ms) × (5 V × 1.1 mA) = 199.3 nW \nThe contribution to the total power dissipated by the remaining time is 939.96 μW . \n(799.97 ms/800 ms) × (5 V × 188 μA) = 939.96 μW \nThus the total power dissipated during each cycle is \n199.3 nW + 939.96 μW = 940.16 μW \n \nIDD\nTIME1.1mA\n188\uf06dA\n800ms29\uf06ds\n02463-014 \nFigure 14. Mode 1 Power Dissipation \nMode 2 \nIn this mode, the part is totally powered down. All circuitry \nexcept the serial interface is switched off. The most power \nefficient way of operating in this mode is to use the one-shot \nmethod. Write to the configuration register and set the one-shot bit \nto a 1. The part powers up in approximately 4 \uf06ds and then \nperforms a conversion. Once the conversion is finished, the \ndevice powers down again until the PD bit in the configuration register is set to 0 or the one-shot bit is set to 1. Figure 15 shows \nthe same timing as Figure 14 in mode 1; a one-shot is initiated \nevery 800 ms. If we take the voltage supply to be 5 V , we can work out the power dissipation in the following way. The current consumption for the part when converting is 1.1 mA typically, and the quiescent current is 800 nA typically. The \nconversion time of 25 μs plus the power-up time of typically \n4 \uf06ds contributes 199.3 nW to the overall power dissipation in \nthe following way: \n(29 μs/800 ms) × (5 V × 1.1 mA) = 199.3 nW The contribution to the total power dissipated by the remaining \ntime is 4 μW . \n(799.97 ms/800 ms) × (5 V × 800 nA) = 4 μW \nThus the total power dissipated during each cycle is: \n199.3 nW + 4 μW = 4.2 μW  \n \nIDD\nTIME1.1mA\n800nA\n800ms29\uf06ds\n02463-015 \nFigure 15. Mode 2 Power Dissipation \nMOUNTING THE AD7414/AD7415 \nThe AD7414/AD7415 can be used for surface or air tempera-\nture sensing applications. If the device is cemented to a surface \nwith thermally conductive adhesive, the die temperature is within about 0.1°C of the surface temperature, due to the device’s low power consumption. Care should be taken to insulate the back and leads of the device from the air if the ambient air temperature is different from the surface temperature being measured. \nThe ground pin provides the best thermal path to the die, so the \ntemperature of the die is close to that of the printed circuit ground track. Care should be taken to ensure that this is in \ngood thermal contact with the surface being measured. \nAs with any IC, the AD7414/AD7415 and their associated \nwiring and circuits must be kept free from moisture to prevent leakage and corrosion, particularly in cold conditions where \ncondensation is more likely to occur. Water-resistant varnishes \nand conformal coatings can be used for protection. The small size of the AD7414/AD7415 packages allows them to be mounted inside sealed metal probes, which provide a safe \nenvironment for the devices. \nSUPPLY DECOUPLING \nThe AD7414/AD7415 should at least be decoupled with a 0.1μF \nceramic capacitor between V DD and GND. This is particularly \nimportant if the AD7414/AD7415 are mounted remote from the power supply. \nData Sheet AD7414 /AD7415\n \nRev. G | Page 15 of 19 TEMPERATURE ACCURACY VS.
