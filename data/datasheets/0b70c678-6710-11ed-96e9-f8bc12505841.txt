C | Page 10 of 13 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \n \nFigure 22. Typical Application Diagram  \nJITTER ATTENUATION  \nIn some cases, reference clocks to the system may come from \nexternal noisy sources with high jitter. The HMC1031 can be \nused to attenuate this incom ing jitter and distribute a clean \nclock in the system. In such a scheme, a narrow loop filter is \nselected for the HMC1031. The device frequency locks to the \nexternal VCXO , but the reference jitter is attenuated as  defined by \nthe set loop filter bandwidth. The final output frequency and \nphase noise characteristics outside the loop bandwidth is  defined \nby the phase noise characteristics of the VCXO used. A low jitter clock re ference yields better clocking performance and  \nbetter LO performance of the RF PLL VCOs, and improves the \nSNR performance of analog -to-digital converters (ADCs) and \ndigital -to-analog converters (DAC s). \nFREQUENCY TRANSLATIO N \nThe reference clock in a test an d measurement system or a \ncommunications system is often a high accuracy OCXO with \nexcellent long -term stability. In some applications,  the OCXO \nfrequency must  be multiplied up to a higher rate to drive the \nprimary clock inputs in a system. The HMC1031 offers a very \nlow power, small package and high performance method to mult iply its incoming frequency in 1 ×, 5×, and 10 × rates. Such \nmultiplication is required  because the higher reference clocks \nimprove phase noise, ADC/DAC signal- to-noise ratio (SNR ), \nclock generator jitter , and PHY  bit error rates (BERs ). In this \nscheme, the HMC1031 can be connected to an external low cost \nVCXO ( for ex ample, at 50  MHz or 100 MHz), and lock this \nexternal VCXO to the excellent long -term stability of the OCXO.  \nLOOP BANDWIDTHS WITH  HMC1031  \nIn typical jitter attenuation applications, an incoming reference clock is frequency locked with a narrow PLL loop bandwidth such that its incoming noise is filtered out by the PLL and  VCXO \ncombination. The out of band phase noise of t he PLL follows \nthe VC XO that it i s locked to. A narrow PLL loop bandwidth \nensures that the output jitter is determined by the VCXO (or any other type of high quality factor VCO) and not affected by the spectral noise of the incoming clock beyond the set loop \nbandwidth.  \nTo faci litate narrow  bandwidth  loop filter configurations, the \nHMC1031 is designed to have a low charge pump current  of \n50 µA. This architecture offers advantages in low  power  consump -\ntion and loop fil ter design. Typically, narrow loop filter  bandwidths require large filter capacitors. Due  to the  low charge \npump current design of the HMC1031 , smaller loop filter  capaci -\ntor sizes can  be used to implement narrow loop filters. Note  that \nthe HMC1031 is designed to operate in loop bandwidths of only \na few kilohertz in its widest loop bandwidth configuration.  \nUSING VCO s/VCXO s WITH NEGATIVE TUNING \nSLOPE  \nIn its typical  configuration, the HMC1031 work s with any \nVCO/VCXO that has a positive tuning slope. For any  VCO/VCXO \nwith negative tuning slope , that is, when the freque ncy decreases \nwith increasing tuning voltage, connect the loop filter ac ground \nto VCC instead of GND.  \nLOCK DETECTOR  \nThe lock detector measures the arrival times between the divided \nVCO edge and reference edge ap pearing at the phase detector. \nWhen this offset becomes greater than approximately 6  ns, the \nlock detector indicates an out of lock condition. Any leakage \ncurrent on the CP output cause s a phase offset between the two \nedges. Due to the relatively small 50  µA charge pump current , \nthe HMC1031 is sensitive to leakage currents and may indicate \na false out of lock  condition  if the leakage current from the \ncharge pump ( Pin 7) to ground is too high.  \nLeakage currents include dc current through  the loop filter \ncapacitors and/or dc current into the VCO tuning voltage pin, V\nTUNE. It is recommended to use low leakage , loop filter multi -\nlayer  ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) and careful VCO selection to \nmaximize  VTUNE resistance. Th e maximum acceptable leakage is \ndependent on the phase detector operating frequency and can be calculated as follows:  \nPD CPLEAKAGE\nt II ns3=  \nwhere:  \nILEAKAGE  is the total leakage current in µA.  \nICP is the charge pump current in µ A (set to 50  µA). \ntPD is the reference frequency period in ns . \nInternal delays reduce the available lock detector range  from \n6 ns to 3 ns.  \n \n UP TO 140MHz\nNOISY CLOCK\nREFERENCENARROW LOOP FILTER\nUP TO 500MHz\nCLEAN CLOCK\nSIGNALVCXOVCC\nD0LKDOPREFIN1\n2\n3\n4GND\nD1VCOINCP8\n7\n6\n5PFD/CP\nLKD 1/NHMC1031\n13353-023\nData Sheet  HMC1031  \n \nRev.

#### Description:
The HMC1031 is a low-power clock generator that operates within a frequency range of 0.1 MHz to 500 MHz. It features an integer N phase-locked loop (PLL) architecture, which allows for programmable clock multiplication ratios of 1, 5, and 10. The device is designed to work in conjunction with an external loop filter and a voltage-controlled crystal oscillator (VCXO) to provide a complete clock generation solution. The HMC1031 is particularly noted for its low jitter performance and ability to attenuate incoming jitter from noisy reference clocks.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Low Jitter Clock Generation**: The HMC1031 is used to generate stable clock signals with minimal jitter, which is crucial for high-performance digital systems.
- **Low Bandwidth Jitter Attenuation**: It can filter out high-frequency noise from reference clocks, providing a cleaner clock signal for downstream applications.
- **Low Frequency Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs)**: The device can be integrated into PLL circuits to maintain frequency stability and accuracy.
- **Frequency Translation**: It can multiply the frequency of incoming signals, making it suitable for applications requiring higher frequency references.
- **Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator (OCXO) Frequency Multipliers**: The HMC1031 can be used to enhance the frequency output of OCXOs, improving overall system performance.
- **Phase Locking Clean High-Frequency References**: It is utilized to lock and clean high-frequency references to ensure reliable operation in communication systems.

This component is ideal for applications in telecommunications, data converters, and any system requiring precise clock generation and jitter management.
