It regulates the output during an overvoltage \nevent, such as load dump in vehicles, by controlling the gate of an external N-channel MOSFET . The output is limited to a safe value allowing the loads to continue functioning. The L T4363 also monitors the voltage drop between the SNS and OUT pins to protect against overcurrent faults. An internal amplifier limits the voltage across the current sense resistor to 50mV . In either fault condition, a timer is started inversely proportional to MOSFET stress. Before the timer expires, the F LT  pin pulls low to warn of an impend -\ning power down. If the condition persists, the MOSFET is turned off. The L T4363-1 remains off until reset whereas \nthe L\nT4363-2 restarts after a cool down period.\nT wo precision comparators can monitor the input supply for overvoltage (OV) and undervoltage (UV) conditions. When the potential is below the UV threshold, the external MOSFET is kept off. If the input supply voltage is above the OV threshold, the MOSFET is not allowed to turn back on. Back-to-back MOSFETs can be used in lieu of a Schottky diode for reverse input protection, reducing voltage drop and power loss. A shutdown pin reduces the quiescent current to less than 7µA during shutdown.\nTypical applica Tion FeaTures Descrip TionHigh Voltage Surge  \nStopper with Current Limit\n4A, 12V Overvoltage Output Regulator with 150V Surge Protection Overvoltage Protector Regulates \nOutput at 27V During T ransientapplica Tionsn Withstands Surges Over 100V with V CC Clamp\nn Wide Operating Voltage Range: 4V to 80V\nn Adjustable Output Clamp Voltage\nn Fast Overcurrent Limit: Less Than 5µs\nn Reverse Input Protection to –60V\nn Adjustable UV/OV Comparator Thresholds\nn Low 7µA Shutdown Current\nn Shutdown Pin Withstands –60V to 100V\nn Adjustable Fault Timer\nn Controls N-Channel MOSFET\nn Less Than 1% Retry Duty Cycle During Faults, L\nT4363-2\nn Available in 12-Pin (4mm ×  3mm) DFN, 12-Pin \nMSOP and 16-Pin SO Packages\nn Automotive/Avionic/Industrial Surge Protection\nn Hot Swap™/Live Insertion\nn High Side Switch for Battery Powered Systems\nn Intrinsic Safety Applications\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks and  \nNo R SENSE , ThinSOT and Hot Swap are trademarks of Linear Technology Corporation.

The state of the pin is latched until the OUT pin voltage drops below 2V , resetting the latch. The internal NPN is capable of sinking up to 2mA of current.\nExposed Pad (DFN Package Only): Exposed pad may be \nleft open or connected to device ground (GND).\nFB: Voltage Regulator Feedback Input. Connect this pin to \nthe center tap of the resistive divider connected between the OUT pin and ground. During an overvoltage condition, the GATE pin is controlled to maintain a 1.275V threshold at the FB pin. Connect to GND to disable the OV clamp.\nFLT: Open Collector Fault Output. This pin pulls low after \nthe voltage at the TMR pin has reached the fault threshold \nof 1.275V . It indicates the pass transistor is about to turn off because either the supply voltage has stayed at an elevated level for an extended period of time (voltage fault) or the device is in an overcurrent condition (current fault). The internal NPN is capable of sinking up to 2mA of current. \nGATE: N-Channel MOSFET Gate Drive Output. The GATE pin \nis pulled up by an internal charge pump current source to \n13V above the OUT pin. A 14V protection clamp limits this voltage during faults. Both voltage and current amplifiers control the GATE pin to regulate the output voltage and limit the current through the MOSFET .\nGND: Device Ground.OUT : Output Voltage Sense Input. This pin senses the \nvoltage at the source of the external N-channel MOSFET . The voltage difference between V\nCC and OUT sets the fault \ntimer current. When this difference drops below 0.5V , the EN pin goes high impedance.\nOV (L T4363-2): Overvoltage Comparator Input. When OV \nis above its threshold of 1.275V , the fault retry function is inhibited even when the TMR pin voltage has reached its retry threshold. As soon as the voltage at OV pin falls below its lower threshold the GATE pin is allowed to turn back on. Connect to GND if unused.\nSHDN: Shutdown Control Input. The L T4363 can be \nshutdown to a low current mode by pulling the SHDN pin below the threshold of 0.4V . Pull this pin above 2.1V or disconnect it to allow the internal current source to turn the part back on. The leakage current to ground at the pin should be limited to no more than 1µA if no external pull up is used to turn the part on. The SHDN pin can be pulled up to 100V or below GND by 60V without damage.\nSNS: Current Sense Input. Connect this pin to the input of \nthe current sense resistor . The current limit circuit controls the GATE pin to limit the sense voltage between SNS and OUT pins to 50mV . This is reduced to 25mV in a severe fault when OUT is below 2V . When in current limit mode, a current source charges up the TMR pin. The voltage difference with the OUT pin must be limited to less than 30V . Connect to OUT pin if unused.\nTMR: Fault Timer Input. Connect a capacitor between this \npin and ground to set the times for early fault warning, fault turn-off, and cool down periods. The current charg -\ning up this pin during fault conditions depends on the voltage difference between the V\nCC and OUT pins. When \nTMR reaches 1.275V , the F LT  pin pulls low to indicate the \ndetection of a fault condition. If the condition persists, the pass transistor turns off when TMR reaches the threshold of 1.375V . A 2µA current source then continues to pull the TMR up. When TMR reaches 4.3V , the 2µA current reverses direction and starts to pull the TMR pin low. When TMR reaches the retry threshold of 0.5V , the GATE pin pulls high turning back on the pass transistor for the L T4363-2 version. The GATE pin latches low after fault time out for the L T4363-1. A minimum of 10nF capacitor is needed to compensate the loop.\nUV: Undervoltage Comparator Input. When UV falls below \nits threshold of 1.275V , the GATE is pulled down with a \n1mA current. When UV rises above 1.275V plus the hys -\nteresis, the pull down current disappears and the GATE pin is pulled up by the internal charge pump. If unused, connect to V\nCC.\nVCC: Positive Supply Voltage Input. The positive supply \ninput ranges from 4V to 80V for normal operation. It can also be pulled below ground by up to 60V during a reverse battery condition, without damaging the part. Shutting down the L T4363 by pulling the SHDN pin to ground will reduce the supply current to 7µA.\nLT43639\n4363fb For more information www.linear .com/L T4363block Diagra M\n+ –+–SNS VCC\nSHDN\nOV \n(LT4363-2 ONLY)IA50mV/\n25mV\n2µA1.375V14V\n1.275V1.275V\n4.3V1.275V–+\n0.5VOUT\nTMR GNDGATE\nUV\n4363 BDVCC\nITMRFLT\nENOUTFB+–CHARGE\nPUMP\nCONTROL\nLOGIC\nGATEOFF FLTVA\nSHDN\nRETRYUV\n+–\n–+\n+–\n–+\n–+\nLT436310\n4363fb For more information www.linear .com/L T4363opera Tion\nSome power systems must cope with high voltage surges \nof short duration such as those in vehicles. Load circuitry must be protected from these transients, yet high availability systems must continue operating during these events.\nThe L T4363 is an overvoltage protection regulator that \ndrives an external N-channel MOSFET as the pass transis -\ntor . It operates from a wide supply voltage range of 4V to 80V . It can also be pulled below ground potential by up to 60V without damage. The low power supply require -\nment of 4V allows it to operate even during cold cranking conditions in automotive applications. The internal charge pump turns on the N-channel MOSFET to supply current to the loads with very little power loss. T\nwo MOSFETs can \nbe connected back to back to replace an inline Schottky diode for reverse input protection. This improves the ef -\nficiency and increases the available supply voltage level to the load circuitr\ny during cold crank.\nNormally, the pass transistor is fully on, powering the loads with very little voltage drop. When the supply voltage surges too high, the voltage amplifier (VA) controls the gate of the MOSFET and regulates the voltage at the OUT pin to a level that is set by the external resistive divider from the OUT pin to ground and the internal 1.275V reference. A current source starts charging up the capacitor connected at the TMR pin to ground. If the TMR voltage reaches 1.275V , the F LT pin pulls low to indicate impending turn-off due \nto the overvoltage condition. The pass transistor stays on until TMR reaches 1.375V , at which point the GATE pin pulls low turning off the MOSFET .\nA current continues to pull the TMR pin up until it reaches \nabout 4.3V , at which point the current reverses direction and pulls the TMR pin down. For the L T4363-2 version, when the voltage at the TMR pin reaches 0.5V the GATE pin begins rising, turning on the MOSFET . The F LT  pin will \nthen return to a high impedance state. For the latch-off version, L T4363-1, both the GATE and F LT pins remain \nlow even after TMR has reached the 0.5V threshold. Allow sufficient time for TMR to discharge to 0.5V and for the MOSFET to cool before attempting to reset the part. To reset, pull the SHDN pin low for at least 100µs, then pull high with a slew rate of at least 10V/ms.\nThe fault timer allows the load to continue functioning \nduring short transient events while protecting the MOSFET from being damaged by a long period of supply overvolt -\nage, such as a load dump in vehicles. The timer period varies with the voltage across the MOSFET . A higher volt-\nage \ncorresponds to a shorter fault timer period, helping \nto keep the MOSFET within its safe operating area (SOA).\nThe L\nT4363 senses an overcurrent condition by monitor -\ning the voltage across an optional sense resistor placed \nbetween the SNS and OUT pins. An active current limit circuit (IA) controls the GA\nTE pin to limit the sense volt -\nage to 50mV , if the OUT pin potential is above 2V . In the case of a severe output short that brings OUT below 2V , the ser\nvo sense voltage is reduced to 25mV to reduce \nthe stress on the pass transistor . During current limit, the current charging the TMR capacitor is about 5 times the current during an overvoltage event. The F LT  pin pulls low \nwhen the TMR voltage reaches 1.275V and the MOSFET is turned off when it reaches 1.375V . The MOSFET turns back on and the F LT  pin returns to a high impedance state \nafter TMR has reached the 0.5V threshold for the L T4363\n-2 \nversion. For the latch-off version, L\nT4363-1, both the GATE \nand F LT pins remain low even after TMR has reached \nthe 0.5V threshold. Reset the part in the same way as in overvoltage time-out case.\nAn accurate undervoltage comparator keeps the GATE \npin low until the voltage at the UV pin is above the 1.275V threshold. An overvoltage comparator prevents the MOSFET from turning on after fault time-out while the voltage at the OV pin is still above 1.275V for the L T4363\n-2. The \nSHDN pin turns off the pass transistor \nand all the internal circuitry, reducing the supply current to a mere 7µA.\nLT436311\n4363fb For more information www.linear .com/L T4363applica Tions inForMaTion\nThe L T4363 limits the voltage and current delivered to the \nload during supply transient or output overload events. The total fault timer period is set to ride through short-duration faults, while longer events cause the output to shut off and protect the MOSFET pass device from damage. The MOSFET provides a low resistance path from the input to the load during normal operation, while in fault conditions it operates as a series regulator .\nOvervoltage Fault\nThe L T4363 limits the voltage at the output during an \novervoltage at the input. An internal amplifier regulates the GATE pin to maintain 1.275V at the FB pin. During this interval the MOSFET is on and supplies current to the load. This allows uninterrupted operation during short overvoltage events. If the overvoltage condition persists, the timer causes the MOSFET to turn off.\nOvercurrent Fault\nThe L T4363 features and adjustable current limit that pro -\ntects against output short circuits or excessive load current. \nDuring an overcurrent event, the GA\nTE pin is regulated to \nlimit the current sense voltage across the SNS and OUT pins to 50mV . In the case of a severe short at the output, where OUT is less than 2V , the current sense voltage is reduced to 25mV to further reduce power dissipation in the MOSFET . If the overcurrent condition persists, the timer causes the MOSFET to turn off.\nFault Timer Overview\nOvervoltage and overcurrent conditions are limited in \nduration by an adjustable timer . A capacitor at the TMR pin sets the delay time before a fault condition is reported at the F LT pin as well as the overall delay before the MOSFET \nis turned off. The same capacitor also sets the cool down time before the MOSFET is allowed to turn back on.\nWhen either an overvoltage or overcurrent fault condition \noccurs, a current source charges the TMR pin capacitor . The exact current level varies as a function of the type of fault and the V\nDS voltage drop across the MOSFET . This \nscheme takes better advantage of the MOSFET’s available Safe Operating Area (SOA) than would a fixed timer current.\nThe TMR pin is biased to 0.5V under normal operating conditions. In the presence of a fault the timer first charges \nto 1.275V , and then enters the early warning phase of operation. At this point the F LT  pin pulls low and after \ncharging to 1.375V , the timer shuts off the MOSFET . The warning phase is indicated by F LT  low and gives time for \nthe load to perform house-keeping chores such as data storage in anticipation of impending power loss. After faulting off, the timer enters the cool down phase. At the end of the cool down period the L T4363-1 remains off until reset, while the L T4363-2 automatically restarts. For the L T4363-2 retry is inhibited if the OV pin is greater than 1.275V . This prevents motorboating in the event there is a sustained input overvoltage condition.\nFault Timer Operation in Overvoltage\nIn the presence of an overvoltage condition when the \nL T4363 regulates the output voltage, the timer charges from 0.5V to 1.275V with a current that varies as a func -\ntion of V\nDS (see Figure 1). V DS is inferred from the drop \nacross V CC and OUT . The timer current increases linearly \nfrom around 4µA with V DS ≤ 0.5V , to 50µA with V DS = 75V . \nBecause V DS is measured indirectly, clamping or filtering \nat the V CC pin affects the timer current response. A graph \nof Overvoltage TMR Current vs (V CC – VOUT) is shown in \nthe Typical Performance Characteristics.\nWhen TMR reaches 1.275V , the F LT  pin is latched low as \nan early warning of impending shutdown. The timer cur -\nrent is cut to a fixed value of 6µA and continues to run \nuntil TMR reaches 1.375V , producing a fixed early warning \nperiod given by:\n  CTMR= tWARNING•6µA\n100mV\nWhen TMR reaches 1.375V , the MOSFET is turned off and allowed to cool for an extended period.

In the presence of an overcurrent con -\ndition when the L T4363 regulates the output current, the timer charges from 0.5V to 1.275V with a current that varies as a function of V\nDS (see Figure 2). The current is \nabout 5 times the value produced in overvoltage, under similar conditions V\nDS, increasing linearly from 8µA with \nVDS < 0.5V to 260µA with V DS = 80V . V DS is inferred from \nthe drop across V CC and OUT . Because V DS is measured \nindirectly, clamping or filtering at the V CC pin affects the \ntimer current response. A graph of Overcurrent TMR Cur -\nrent vs (V CC – VOUT) is shown in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics.When TMR reaches 1.275V , the F LT  pin is latched low as \nan early warning of impending shutdown. But unlike the overvoltage case, the timer current is not reduced and instead continues unabated until TMR reaches 1.375V , producing an early warning period given by:\n  CTMR= tWARNING•ITMR\n100mV\nWhen TMR reaches 1.375V , the MOSFET is turned off and allowed to cool for an extended period. The total elapsed time between the onset of current limiting and turn-off is given by:\n  tLIM=CTMR•0.875V\nITMR\nBecause I TMR is a function of V CC – V OUT, the exact time \nin current limit depends upon the input waveform and the time required for the output current to come into regulation.\nCool Down Phase\nCool Down behavior is the same whether initiated by \novervoltage or overcurrent. During the cool down phase, the timer continues to charge from 1.375V to 4.3V with 2µA, and then discharges back down to 0.5V with 2µA, for a total equivalent voltage swing of 6.725V . The cool down time is given by:\n  tCOOL =CTMR•2.925V+3.8V\n2µA\nUp to this point the operation of the L T4363-1 and L T4363-2 is the same. Behavior at the end of the cool down phase and in response to the SHDN pin is entirely different.\nAt the end of the cool down phase the L T4363-1 remains \nlatched off and F LT  remains low. It may be restarted by \npulling the SHDN pin low for at least 100µs or by cycling power . The cool down phase may be interrupted at any -\ntime by pulling SHDN low for at least 1s/µF of C\nTMR; the \nL T4363-1 will restart when SHDN goes high.\nThe L T4363-2 will automatically retry at the end of the \ncool down phase. Retry is inhibited if the OV pin is above 1.275V; this prevents repetitive retries while the input is held in a sustained overvoltage condition. Retry is auto -applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 1.

OV \nhas no effect on initial start-up when power is first applied and upon exiting shutdown. The cool down phase may be interrupted in the L T4363-2 by pulling SHDN low for at least 1s/µF of C\nTMR.\nFor both the L T4363-1 and L T4363-2 the F LT  pin goes \nhigh in shutdown and is cleared high when power is first applied to V\nCC. If F LT  is set low, it can be reset during the \ncool down phase by pulling SHDN low for at least 1s/µF of C\nTMR.\nIntermittent Fault Conditions\nBrief overvoltage or overcurrent conditions interrupt the \noperation of the timer . If the TMR pin has not yet reached 1.275V when the input falls below the regulation value or drops out of current limit, the timer capacitor is dis -\ncharged back to 0.5V with a 2µA current sink. If the TMR voltage crosses 1.275V F\nLT is set low. If the overvoltage \nor overcurrent abates before reaching 1.375V , the timer capacitor discharges with 2µA back to 0.5V , whereupon F LT resets high. If several short overvoltage or overcurrent \nevents occur in rapid succession, the timer capacitor will integrate the charging and discharging currents.\nMOSFET Selection\nThe L T4363 drives an N-channel MOSFET to conduct the \nload current. The important features of the MOSFET are on-resistance R\nDS(ON) , the maximum drain-source voltage \nV(BR)DSS , the threshold voltage, and the SOA.\nThe maximum allowable drain-source voltage must be higher than the supply voltage. If the output is shorted to ground or during an overvoltage event, the full supply voltage will appear across the MOSFET .\nThe gate drive for the MOSFET is guaranteed to be more \nthan 10V and less than 16V for those applications with V\nCC \nhigher than 9V . This allows the use of standard threshold voltage N-channel MOSFETs. For systems with V\nCC less \nthan 9V , a logic level MOSFET is required since the gate drive can be as low as 4.5V .\nThe SOA of the MOSFET must encompass all fault condi -\ntions. In normal operation the pass transistor is fully on, dissipating ver y little power\n. But during either overvolt -\nage or overcurrent faults, the GATE pin is controlled to \nregulate either the output voltage or the current through the MOSFET . Large current and high voltage drop across \nthe MOSFET can coexist in these cases. The SOA cur\nves \nof the MOSFET must be considered carefully along with the selection of the fault timer capacitor .\nT ransient Stress in the MOSFET\nDuring an overvoltage event, the L T4363 drives a series \npass MOSFET to regulate the output voltage at an acceptable level. The load circuitry may continue operating throughout this interval, but only at the expense of dissipation in the MOSFET pass device. MOSFET dissipation or stress is a function of the input voltage waveform, regulation voltage and load current. The MOSFET must be sized to survive this stress.\nMost transient event specifications use the prototypi -\ncal waveshape shown in Figure 3, comprising a linear \nramp of \nrise time t r, reaching a peak voltage of V PK and \nexponentially decaying back to V IN with a time constant \nof τ. A common automotive transient specification has \nconstants of t r\xa0= 10µs, V PK = 80V and τ = 1ms. A surge \ncondition known as load dump commonly has constants of t\nr = 5ms, V PK = 60V and τ = 200ms.\nMOSFET stress is the result of power dissipated within the device. For long duration surges of 100ms or more, stress is increasingly dominated by heat transfer; this is a matter of device packaging and mounting, and heat sink thermal mass. This is best analyzed by simulation, using the MOSFET thermal model.\nFor short duration transients of less than 100ms, MOSFET \nsurvival is increasingly a matter of safe operating area \nFigure 3.

MOSFET SOA is expressed in units of \nwatt-squared-seconds (P2t). This figure is essentially con -\nstant for intervals of less than 100ms for any given device type, and rises to infinity under DC operating conditions. Destruction mechanisms other than bulk die temperature distort the lines of an accurately drawn SOA graph so that P\n2t is not the same for all combinations of I D and V DS. \nIn particular P2t tends to degrade as V DS approaches the \nmaximum rating, rendering some devices useless for absorbing energy above a certain voltage.\nWhen a fast input voltage step occurs, the current through \nthe pass transistor to supply the load and charge up the out -\nput capacitor can be high enough to trigger an overcurrent event. The gate pulls low to 1V above the OUT pin, turning off the \nMOSFET momentarily. The internal charge pump \nwill then start to pull the GATE pin high and turn on the MOSFET to support the load current and charge up the OUT pin. The fault timer may not start yet because the current level is below the overcurrent limit threshold and the output voltage has not reached the servo voltage. This extra stress needs to be included in calculating the overall stress level of the MOSFET .\nCalculating T ransient Stress\nTo select a MOSFET suitable for any given application, the \nSOA stress must be calculated for each input transient which shall not interrupt operation. It is then a simple matter to choose a device which has adequate SOA to survive the maximum calculated stress. P\n2t for a prototypical transient \nwaveform is calculated as follows (Figure 4):Let\n a = V REG – V IN\n b = V PK – V IN\n (VIN = Nominal Input Voltage)\nThen\n P2t = ILOAD2•\n1\n3trb– a( )3\nb+1\n2τ2a2lnb\na+3a2+b2-4ab\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8ee\n\uf8f0\uf8f9\uf8fb\uf8ec \uf8ec\nTypically V REG ≈ V IN and τ » t r simplifying the above to\n  P2t =1\n2ILOAD2VPK– VREG ( )2τ [W2s]\nFor the transient conditions of V PK = 80V , V IN = 12V , \nVREG = 16V , t r = 10µs and τ = 1ms, and a load current \nof 3A, P2t is 18.4W2s – easily handled by a MOSFET in \na DPAK package. The P2t of other transient waveshapes \nis evaluated by integrating the square of MOSFET power \nover time. L TSpice can be used to simulate timer behavior for more complex transients and cases where overvoltage and overcurrent faults coexist.\nCalculating Short-Circuit Stress\nSOA stress must also be calculated for short-circuit condi -\ntions. Short-circuit P\n2t is given by:\n P2t = ∆VDS•∆VSNS\nRSNS\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8f6\uf8f82\n•tTMR [W2s]\nWhere ∆VDS is the voltage across the MOSFET , and ∆VSNS \nis the SNS pin threshold, and t TMR is the overcurrent timer \ninterval.\nFor V IN = 15V , ∆VDS = 13V (V OUT = 2V), ∆VSNS = 50mV , \nRSNS = 12mΩ and C TMR = 100nF , P2t is 6.3W2s – less \nthan the transient SOA calculated in the previous example. \nNevertheless, to account for circuit tolerances this figure should be doubled to 12.6W\n2s.applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 4.

Overvoltage Regulator with N-channel MOSFET \nReverse Input ProtectionFigure 5. External GATE networkLimiting Inrush Current and GATE Pin Compensation\nThe L T4363 limits the inrush current to any load capacitance \nby controlling the GATE pin voltage slew rate. An external capacitor can be connected from GATE to ground to reduce the inrush current at the expense of slower turn-off time. The gate capacitor is set at:\n  C1=IGATE(UP)\nIINRUSH•CL\nThe L T4363 does not need extra compensation compo-nents at the GATE pin for stability during an overvoltage or overcurrent event. With transient input voltage slew rates \nfaster than 5V\n/µs, a gate capacitor , C1, to ground is needed \nto prevent self enhancement of the N-channel MOSFET .\nThe extra gate capacitance slows down the turn off time \nduring fault conditions and may allow excessive current during an output short event. An extra resistor , R1, in series with the gate capacitor can improve the turn off time. A diode, D1, should be placed across R1 with the cathode connected to C1 as shown in Figure 5.threshold during a fault. The pass transistor is not allowed to turn back on even after the cool down period has finished. This prevents the pass transistor from cycling between ON and OFF states when the input voltage stays at an elevated level for a long period of time, reducing the stress on the N-channel MOSFET . For the latch-off version, L T4363-1, the overvoltage comparator function is not available.\nReverse Input Protection\nA blocking diode is commonly employed to protect the \nload when reverse input is possible, such as in automo -\ntive applications. This diode causes extra power loss, generates heat, and reduces the available supply voltage range. During cold crank, the extra voltage drop across the diode is particularly undesirable.\nThe L T4363 is designed to withstand reverse voltage with -\nout damage to itself. The V\nCC, SHDN, UV , and OV pins can \nwithstand up to 60V of DC voltage below the GND potential. \nBack-to-back MOSFETs must be used to block the current path through Q1’s body diode (Figure 6). Figure 7 shows the approach with a P-channel MOSFET in place of Q2.\nUndervoltage/Overvoltage Comparators\nThe L T4363 has both undervoltage and overvoltage com -\nparators that can be used to sense the input supply volt -\nage. When the voltage at the UV pin is below the 1.275V \nthreshold, the GA TE pin is held low to keep the external \nMOSFET off. The supply voltage at the V\nCC pin should be \nat least 4V for the UV comparator to function.\nThe overvoltage comparator prevents the L T4363-2 from \nrestarting if the voltage at the OV pin is above the 1.275V C1R3\n4363 F05LT4363GATEQ1\nR1D1\n1N4148W\nLT436316\n4363fb For more information www.linear .com/L T4363applica Tions inForMaTion\nShutdown\nThe L T4363 can be shut down to a low current mode when \nthe voltage at the SHDN pin is pulled below the shutdown threshold of 0.4V . The quiescent current drops down to 7µA with internal circuitry turned off.\nThe SHDN pin can be pulled up to 100V or below GND by \nup to 60V without damage. Leaving the pin open allows \nan internal current source to pull it up and turn on the part while clamping the pin to 2.2V . The leakage current at the pin should be limited to no more than 1µA if no pull up device is used to help turn it on.\nSupply T ransient Protection\nThe L T4363 is tested to operate to 80V and guaranteed to \nbe safe from damage up to 100V . Nevertheless, voltage transients above 100V may cause permanent damage. During a short-circuit condition, the large change in cur -\nrent flowing through power supply traces and associated wiring can cause inductive voltage transients which could exceed 100V . T\no minimize the voltage transients, the power \ntrace parasitic inductance should be minimized by using wide traces. A small RC filter , in Figure 8, at the V\nCC pin \nwill clamp the voltage spikes.Another way to limit transients above 100V at the V CC \npin is to use a Zener diode and a resistor , D1 and R7 in Figure\n 8. The Zener diode limits the voltage at the pin while \nthe resistor \nlimits the current through the diode to a safe \nlevel during the surge. However , D1 can be omitted if the filtered voltage, due to R7 and C1, at the V\nCC pin is below \n100V . The inclusion of R7 in series with the V CC pin will \nincrease the minimum required voltage at V IN due to the \nextra voltage drop across it. This voltage drop is due to the supply current of the L T4363 and the leakage current of D1.\nA total bulk capacitance of at least 22µF low ESR electro -\nlytic is required close to the source pin of MOSFET Q1. In \naddition, the bulk capacitance should be at least 10 times larger than the total ceramic bypassing capacitor on the input of the DC/DC converter .\nLayout Considerations\nT\no achieve accurate current sensing, Kelvin connection \nto the current sense resistor (R SNS in Figure 8) is recom-\nmended. The minimum trace width for 1 oz copper foil is \n0.02" per amp to ensure the trace stays at a reasonable temperature. 0.03" per amp or wider is recommended. Note that 1oz copper exhibits a sheet resistance of about 530µΩ/square. Small resistances can cause large errors in  \nhigh current applications. Noise immunity will be improved\n Figure 8.
