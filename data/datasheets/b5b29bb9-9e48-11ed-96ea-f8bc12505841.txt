Todothis, allquiescent operating current\nisreturned totheoutput establishing aminimum load current requirement. Ifthere isinsufficient load onthe\noutput, theoutput willrise.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nCopyright ©2000 –2015, Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Documentation Feedback 9\nProduct Folder Links: LM117HV LM317HV\nLM117HV ,LM317HV\nSNVS773D –APRIL 2000 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2015 www.ti.com\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Load Regulation\nTheLM317HV iscapable ofproviding extremely good load regulation butafewprecautions areneeded toobtain\nmaximum performance. The current setresistor, R1, should beconnected near theoutput terminal ofthe\nregulator rather than near theload. IfR1isplaced toofarfrom theoutput terminal, then theincreased trace\nresistance, RS,willcause anerror voltage drop intheadjustment loop anddegrade load regulation performance.\nTherefore, R1should beplaced asclose aspossible totheoutput terminal tominimize RSand maximize load\nregulation performance.\nFigure 14shows theeffect ofthetrace resistance, RS,when R1isplaced farfrom theoutput terminal ofthe\nregulator. Itisclear that RSwillcause anerror voltage drop especially during higher current loads, soitis\nimportant tominimize theRStrace resistance bykeeping R1close totheregulator output terminal.\nFigure 14.Regulator With Line Resistance inOutput Lead\nWith theTO-3 package, itiseasy tominimize theresistance from thecase tothesetresistor, byusing two\nseparate leads tothecase. However, with theTO-39 package, take care tominimize thewire length ofthe\noutput lead. The ground ofR2canbereturned near theground oftheload toprovide remote ground sensing\nandimprove load regulation.\n8.3.2 Current Limit\nInternal current limit willbeactivated whenever theoutput current exceeds thelimit indicated inTypical\nCharacteristics .However, iftheregulators differential voltage exceeds theabsolute maximum rating of60V\nduring ashort-circuit condition (forexample: VIN≥60V,VOUT=0V),internal junctions intheregulator may break\ndown andthedevice may bedamaged orfail.Failure modes range from anapparent open orshort from input to\noutput oftheregulator, toadestroyed package (most common with theTO-220 package). Toprotect the\nregulator, theuser isadvised tobeaware ofvoltages thatmay beapplied totheregulator during fault conditions\nandtoavoid violating theAbsolute Maximum Ratings .\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 External Capacitors\nAninput bypass capacitor isrecommended. A0.1-μFdisc or1-μFsolid tantalum ontheinput issuitable input\nbypassing foralmost allapplications. The device ismore sensitive totheabsence ofinput bypassing when\nadjustment oroutput capacitors areused buttheabove values willeliminate thepossibility ofproblems.\nThe adjustment terminal canbebypassed toground ontheLM317HV toimprove ripple rejection. This bypass\ncapacitor prevents ripple from being amplified astheoutput voltage isincreased. With a10-μFbypass capacitor\nthe80-dB ripple rejection isobtainable atanyoutput level. Increases over 10μFdonotappreciably improve the\nripple rejection atfrequencies above 120 Hz.Ifthebypass capacitor isused, itissometimes necessary to\ninclude protection diodes toprevent thecapacitor from discharging through internal low current paths and\ndamaging thedevice.\n10 Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2000 –2015, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM117HV LM317HV\n/c40 /c41 OUT ADJRV = 1.25 V I RR2211/c230 /c246/c43 /c43/c231 /c247/c232 /c248\nLM117HV ,LM317HV\nwww.ti.com SNVS773D –APRIL 2000 –REVISED SEPTEMBER 2015\nDevice Functional Modes (continued)\nIngeneral, thebest type ofcapacitors tousearesolid tantalum. Solid tantalum capacitors have lowimpedance\neven athigh frequencies. Depending upon capacitor construction, ittakes about 25μFinaluminum electrolytic to\nequal 1μFofsolid tantalum athigh frequencies. Ceramic capacitors arealso good athigh frequencies, butsome\ntypes have alarge decrease incapacitance atfrequencies around 0.5MHz. Forthisreason, a0.01-μFdisc may\nseem towork better than a0.1-μFdisc asabypass.\nAlthough theLM317HV isstable with nooutput capacitors, likeanyfeedback circuit, certain values ofexternal\ncapacitance cancause excessive ringing. This occurs with values between 500 pFand 5000 pF.A1-μFsolid\ntantalum (or25-μFaluminum electrolytic) ontheoutput swamps thiseffect andensures stability. Any increase of\nload capacitance larger than 10μFwillmerely improve theloop stability andoutput impedance.\n8.4.2 Protection Diodes\nWhen external capacitors areused with anyICregulator itissometimes necessary toadd protection diodes to\nprevent thecapacitors from discharging through lowcurrent points intotheregulator. Most 10-μFcapacitors have\nlowenough internal series resistance todeliver 20-A spikes when shorted. Although thesurge isshort, there is\nenough energy todamage parts oftheIC.\nWhen anoutput capacitor isconnected toaregulator andtheinput isshorted, theoutput capacitor willdischarge\nintotheoutput oftheregulator. The discharge current depends onthevalue ofthecapacitor, theoutput voltage\noftheregulator, andtherate ofdecrease ofVIN. IntheLM317HV, thisdischarge path isthrough alarge junction\nthat isable tosustain 15-A surge with noproblem. This isnottrue ofother types ofpositive regulators. For\noutput capacitors of25μForless, there isnoneed tousediodes.\nThe bypass capacitor ontheadjustment terminal candischarge through alowcurrent junction. Discharge occurs\nwhen either theinput oroutput isshorted. Internal totheLM317HV isa50-Ωresistor which limits thepeak\ndischarge current. Noprotection isneeded foroutput voltages of25Vorless and10-μFcapacitance.

Due toitswide input\nvoltage range, theLMx17HV serves avariety ofapplications and provides aprecise voltage regulation with low\ndropout across awide output voltage and load current range. The device regulates aconstant 1.25 Vbetween\nVOUTandADJ, soplacing afixed resistor between these pins provides aconstant current regulation.
