The part provides precise and \nrobust current limiting, and protection against both transient and nontransient short circuits in overvoltage and undervoltage \nconditions. The ADM1073 can operate from a negative vol tage \nof −18 V to −80 V and can tolerate transient voltages of up to \n−200 V .  \nInrush current is limited to a programmable value by control -\nling the gate drive of an external N -channel FET. The maximum \ncurrent limit is set by the choice of the sense resistor,  R\nSENSE.  A built -in soft start function allows control of the inrush \ncurrent profile by an external capacitor on the soft start (SS) pin.  \nAn external capacitor on the TIMER pin determines the time \nfor which the FET gate is controlled to be high when maximum inrush current flows. The ADM1073 employs a limited consec -\nutive retry scheme, whereby, if the load capacitance is not fully \ncharged within one attempt, the FET gate is pulled low and retries after a cooling period.  \n (continued on Page 3 ) \n \nADM1073  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

B | Page 3  of 24 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \n(continued from P age 1)  \nFurther control of the inrush current is provided by modulating \nthe width of the pulses, depending on the drain -source voltage \nacross the FET . This allows maximum charge transfer to the \nload capacitance while maintaining the FET in its safe operating \narea (SOA).  \nThe default duty cycle of the pulse train is 6%, decreasing to \n2.5% with maximum FET drain -source voltage, with a \nmaximum of seven  successive autorestarts. After seven  \nsuccessive autorestarts, the fault is latched and the part goes into shutdo wn, with the result that the external FET is disabled until \nthe power is reset. The \nLATCHED  output signal indicates when \nthe seven  retries are complete.  \nFurther programmability is offered by allowing alteration of the default 6% rat io. An extra resist or between the TIMER pin and \nV\nEE allows the ratio of on -time to off -time to be decreased, \nwhile a resistor between TIMER and V IN allows the ratio  to be \nincreased.  \nThe ADM1073 has separate UV and OV pins for undervoltage and overvoltage d etection. The FET is turned off, if a \nnontransient voltage less than the undervoltage threshold (typically −36 V) is detected on the UV pin, or if greater than \nthe overvoltage threshold (typically −80 V) is detected on the OV pin. The operating voltage window of the ADM1073 is programma ble via resistor networks on the UV and OV pins.  \nThe hysteresis levels on the undervoltage and overvoltage detectors can also be altered (see the Undervoltage/Overvoltage \nDetection  section). The \nSPLYGD  output signal indicates when \nthe backplane supply is within the exter nally programmable \noperating voltage range.  \nOther functions include  \n• PWRGD  output, which can be used to enable a power \nmodule (the DRAIN pin is monitored to determine when \nthe load capacitance is fully charged)  \n• SHD N input to manually disable the GATE drive  \n• RESTART  input to remotely initiate a 5 second shutdown  \nThe ADM1073 is fabricated using BiCMOS technology for \nminimal power consumption and is available in a 14 -lead \nTSSOP package.  \n \n \n \nADM1073 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

B | Page 13 of 24 FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTI ON  \nHOT CIRCUIT INSERTIO N  \nInserting circuit boards into  a live −48 V backplane can cause \nlarge transient currents to be drawn as the board capacitance \ncharges up. These transient currents can cause glitches on the \nsystem power supply and can permanently damage the board connectors and components.  \nThe ADM1073 i s designed to control the manner in which a \nboard’s supply voltage is applied so that harmful transient currents do not occur and the board can be safely inserted or removed from a live backplane. Undervoltage, overvoltage, and overcurrent protection are o ther features of the part. The \nADM1073 ensures that the input voltage is stable and within tolerance before being applied to the power module.  INITIAL STARTUP  \nThe ADM1073 hot swap controller normally resides on a removable circuit board and controls the manner in which \npower is applied to the board upon conne ction. This is achieved \nusing a  FET, Q1, in the power path (see Figure 31). By \ncontrolling the gate voltage of the transistor, the surge of current \nto charge load capacitance  can be limited to a safe value when \nthe board makes connection. The ADM1073 can also reside on \nthe backplane itself and perform the same function from there.  \nFigure 32 shows a typical ADM1073 application circuit. When \nthe plug -in board is inserted into the live backplane, the −48 V \nand 0 V lines connect to the live supply. This powers up the device with the voltage on V\nIN exceeding V LKO. When the \nvoltage on the UV pin exceeds the undervoltage rising threshold (0.868  V), it is now inside the programmed operating \nvoltage window. It must stay inside this window for the duration \nof the power -on reset delay time, t\nPOR (150 ms).  \nSHDN RESTART\nRDRO P\nRDRAINLATCHED\nSPLYGD\nPWRGDADM1073\nCTIMERCSSCLOAD\nR4R3\nR2R1\nDC-DC\nCONVERTERVIN+\nVIN–\n04488-031RSENSE FETLIVE\nBACKPLANE0V\n–48VPLUG-IN BOARD\n \nFigure 31.

B | Page 14 of 24 When the device detects that the supply voltage is valid, it \nramps up the GATE voltage until the FET turns on and the load \ncurrent increases. The ADM1073 monitors the level of the current flowing through the FET by sensing the voltage across  \nthe external sense resistor, R\nSENSE. When the SENSE voltage \nreaches 100 mV , the GATE pin is actively controlled, limiting the load current. In this way, the maximum current permitted \nto flow through the load is set by the choice of R\nSENSE. \nIf a change in the level of the supply voltage causes the voltage \non UV to fall below the undervoltage falling threshold (V UVF), \nor the voltage on OV to rise above the overvoltage rising \nthreshold (V OVR), then the gate drive is disabled. \nBOARD REMOVAL  \nIf the board is rem oved from a card cage, the voltage on the UV \npin falls to zero (that is, outside operating range) and the GATE drive is de -asserted, turning off the FET. \nCONTROLLING THE CURR ENT \nThe ADM1073 features the following current control functions:  \n• Precision maximu m current limit  \n• Controlled time in current limit  \n• Limited number of consecutive maximum current events  \n• Current limit profiling —soft sta rt \n• Overcurrent fast limit  \nIn the following sections, five distinct system operating \nconditions are described with referenc e to the current control \nfeatures.  \nStartup into Nominal Load Capacitance  \nOnce the supply voltage has exceeded the UV threshold, and following the 0.6 ms UV filter time, the current to the load \nramps up linearly as the capacitor on the Soft Start (SS) pin i s \ncharged to 2.5 V . At the same time, current is sourced into the capacitor  on the TIMER pin, both from an on -chip source and \nvia the drain resistor. Once the soft start voltage has reached \n2.5 V , the current to the load is limited to I\nMAX (100 mV/R SENSE). \nAssuming that the values of R SENSE and the TIMER capacitance \nhave been chosen to allow the load capacitance to charge within \none ON period (t ON period), the load cap acitor  is fully charged \nbefore the voltage on TIMER reaches 2.5 V . At this point, the \ncurrent to the load decreases, and the FET gate voltage increases \nto V SS, connecting the supply to the load.  \nStartup into Load with Large Capacitance  \nIf the load capacitance is sufficiently large that to charge it fully \nin one attempt would compromise the FET’ s SOA, consecutive \nmaximum current events may be used. The use of this tech -\nnique assumes that the load is not yet enabled, so negligible \nload current is demanded. The initial current profiling is identical to that for startup into a nominal load capacitan ce. If \nthe charge passed to the load in time t\nON with maximum current \nflowing is insufficient to fully charge the load capacitance, at the end of the t ON period the load capacitance is still demanding \nmaximum current. The ADM1073 now controls the FET gate  to \nzero for a time t OFF, determined by the time taken for the on -\nchip current sink to discharge the TIMER capacitance to 0.5  V.  \nAt the end of time t OFF, the device retries, again following the \nsoft star t current profile. In this way, a large load capaci tance \ncan be charged using consecutive current limit periods. The \nexternal components should be chosen to ensure that the capacitance is fully char ged within seven TIMER periods, if the \ndefault limited  consecutive retry mode is used . \nStartup into a Short C ircuit or over Current Fault  \nThe load might demand large currents at initial connection. \nThe ADM1073 follows the Soft Start current profile as \ndescribed for startup into a nominal load. The current is limited at I\nMAX for time t ON following which the FET ga te is pulled low. \nThe FET gate is held low for time t OFF, before retrying, again \nwith the soft start current profile. The ADM1073 cycles through \n7 retries, afte r which it latches the FET off, assuming the default \nlimited consecutive r etry mode is used.  \nVol tage Step during Normal Operation  \nOnce the load capacitance is  charged at initial board insertion \nand a PWRGD  signal is issued by the ADM1073, the load \nbegins to demand current. Therefore, following a step increase \nin the magnitude o f the supply voltage, not all the FET current \nis available for charging of the load capacitance. Because the \nFET is fully on following a step in the supply voltage, the \ncurrent increases immediately from I LOAD to supply charge to \nthe load capacitance. If t he current remains below the fast \ncurrent limit, the FET gate drive amplifier controls it back to I\nMAX. If the current exceeds the fast current limit, the FET gate is \nstrongly pulled down and back into regulation with the current at I\nMAX. The size of the v oltage step and the headroom between \nthe load current and I MAX determine the time required at I MAX to \ncharge the load capacitance. External components should be \nchosen to ensure that any expected step size leads to a \nrequirement of less than time t ON to ch arge the load capacitance.  \nShort Circuit or Overcurrent Fault during Operation  \nIf a short circuit or an overcurrent fault occurs during normal \noperation, the FET is fully on and initially allows increased current to flow. If the current remains below the f ast current \nlimit, the FET gate drive amplifier controls it back to I\nMAX. If the \ncurrent exceeds the fast current limit, the FET gate is strongly pulled down and back into regulation with the current at I\nMAX. \nFollowing a period , tON, the ADM1073 pulls the FET gate low \nfor a time t OFF, then retries following the soft start current \nprofile. If the fault persists, the ADM1073 cycles through 7 retries before latching off. If the fault clears within the 7 -retry \nperiod, the ADM1073 controls the FET gate high to a llow \nnormal operation to continue.  \nData Sheet  ADM1073  \n \nRev. B | Page 15 of 24 SENSE  \nThe SENSE pin is used for sensing the voltage across an \nexternal power sense resistor. This voltage is differentially \nmeasured with respect to V EE, and used to control the GATE. \nIf SENSE is lower than 100 mV (after the soft start time), the \nGATE pin is allowed to increase up to 12 V to provide \nmaximum FET enhancement. If the current increases such that the SENSE pin tries to go above 100 mV , the GATE pin is controlled in a feedback loop to ensure that the voltage ac ross \nthe sense resistor is regulated at exactly 100 mV .  \nSENSE RESISTOR  \nThe ADM1073’s current limiting function can operate at different current levels. The current limit is determined by selection of the sense resistor, R\nSENSE. Table 4 shows how the \nmaximum allowable load current (I LOAD(MAX) ) and the minimum \nand maximum inrush currents (I LIMIT(MIN)  and I LIMIT(MAX) ) are \nrelated to the value of R SENSE. \nTable 4.

Whenever the FET \nis requested to turn on, the SS pin is held at ground until the \nSENSE pin reaches a few mV . A current source is then turned \non, which linearly ramps the capacitor up to 2.5 V . The reference voltage for the GATE linear control amplifier is derived from the soft start voltage, such that the inrush linear \ncurrent limit is defined as  \nSENSE START SOFT LIMIT R V I × = 20/_  \nOverdriving the SS Pin  \nThe SS pin can be overdriven externally from 0.360 V to 1.95 V \nto offset the current limit control loop threshold from 18 mV to \n100 mV . This allows different current limits to be selected at \ndifferent points of operation w ithout using  multiple sense \nresistors. The current limit voltage is clamped at 100  mV \nmaximum.  GATE  \nAnalog output for driving the external FET gate. This pin is \nswitched to V EE when the FET is off, is linearly controlled when \nthe FET is at the programmed inrush current limit, and is \nswitched to V IN when the FET is fully enhanced. The source \ncurrent capability is small to provide slow controlled turn -on, \nand the sink current capability is large to provide fast turn -off. \nVIN \nPositive supply pin. This current -driven supply is shunt -\nregulated at 12.3 V internally, and should be connected to the most positive input supply terminal (usually −48 V RTN or 0  V) \nthrough a dropper resistor. The resistor should be chosen such that it always supplies enough current to overcome the maximum quiescent supply current of the chip. Default R\nDROP = \n30 kΩ. \nVEE \nNegative supply input. This pin should be conne cted directly to \nthe most negative input supply terminal (−48 V). This pin is also used for differentially sensing across the external power \nresistor, and should, therefore, be connected as close to the \nsense resistor as possible. (See the Kelvin Sense Resistor Connection  section.)  \nTIMING CONTROL —TIMER  \nThe TIMER pin is an analog pin that determines the maximum \non-time when the FET is in linear current limit, and controls \nthe PWM duty cycle for pulsed load capacitor charging. A \ncapacitor should be attached to this pin. When the FET is in \ncurrent limit, a 19 µA current source charges the external capacitor. If the FET is still in current limit when the TIMER capacitor reaches 2.5 V , the GATE driver is turned off and a 1 µA discharge current sink is turned on. The GATE remains \nlow until the TIMER capacitor is  reduced to 0.5 V . At this point, \nthe GATE pin is turned on again. If the FET goes back into \ncurrent limit, the TIMER recharging starts again.  \nThe PWM duty cycle is set at 6% defau lt level by the size of \nthese two current sources. Adding a resistor from TIMER to V\nEE \ndecreases the duty cycle. Adding a resistor from TIMER to V IN  \nincreases the duty cycle.  \nIn addition, a current proportional to the current into the \nDRAIN pin is added t o the charging current. The additional \ncurrent varies linearly with DRAIN voltage. This reduce s the \nmaximum on -time and the percentage PWM duty cycle when \nthere is a large voltage across the FET.  \nADM1073  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 16 of 24 DRAIN  \nAnalog input fed by a resistor connected to the drai n of the \nFET. This pin is clamped to go no higher than 4 V with respect \nto V EE. Below this level, the voltage on the pin is monitored so \nthat, if it falls below 2 V , the PWRGD  output can be set. Above \nthe 4  V level, the current into the pin is detected and used to \nmodu late the maximum on -time for the linear FET driver. This \nis done by summing a proportion of the drain input current \nwith the charging current for the TIMER timing cap acitor , \nthereby reducing the allowable on -time.  \nPWRGD  \nOutput to indicate when the load capacitor is fully charged. This is an open collector output with internal pull -up to V\nIN. \nWhen a normal startup is initiated, the PWRGD  output is \nlatched low when the DRAIN pi n falls below 2 V . The latch is \nreset, if either the input supply goes out of range or a current limit time -out event occurs. The second of these cases ensures \nthat, if a voltage step of greater than 2 V is presented at the \ninput, the \nPWRGD  flag does not go high while the load \ncapacitor is being charged up to the additional voltage.  \nLATCHED  \nOutput to indicate when the device has completed the maxi -\nmum number (7) of PWM cycles. This is an open collector \noutput wi th an internal current source pull -up. If this PWM \ntime -out event occurs, the GATE pin is latched low and the \nLATCHED  output is set low. This condition can then be reset \nby either a power cycling event or a low signal to either the \nSHDN  input or the RESTART  input. By connecting the \nLATCHED  signal directly to SHDN , the device can effec tively \nbe put into a continuous PWM mode. By connecting the \nLATCHED  signal directly to RESTART , the device can \neffectively be put in to autoretry mode, with a 5 -second cooling \nperiod.  \nSPLYGD  \nOutput to indicate when the input supply is within the pr o-\ngrammed voltage window. This is an open collector output with \nan internal pull- up current source. For very large capacitive \nloads where multiple FETs and controllers are required to meet the inrush requirements, this output can be used to drive directly into the UV pin of a second controller. This allows the \nsecond FET to start 1 ms after the first one, with the added advantage that the input supply UV detection is done on one \ncontroller only.  The \nSPLYGD  output is assert ed only when  the \nADM1073 is not in reset mode.  \nRESTART  \nEdge -triggered input. Allows the user to remotely command a \n5-second shutdown and restart of the hot swap function, \neffectively simulating a board removal and replacement. The shutdown funct ion is triggered by a low pulse of at least 5 µs at \nthe pin. This pin has an internal pull -up of approximately 6 µA, \nallowing it to be driven by an open collector pull- down output \nor a push -pull output. The input threshold is 1.5 V . \nSHD N \nLevel -triggered input.  Allows the user to command a shutdown \nof the hot swap function. When this input is set low, the GATE \noutput is switched to V EE to turn the FET off. This pin has an \ninternal pull- up of approximately 6 µA, allowing it to be drive n \nby an open collector pull -down output or a push -pull output. \nThe input threshold is 1.5 V .  \nUNDERVOLTAGE/OVERVOLTAGE DETECTION  \nThe ADM1073 incorporates dual pin undervoltage and \novervoltage detection, with a programmable operating voltage \nwindow. When the  voltage on the UV pin falls below the UV \nfalling threshold or the voltage on the OV pin rises above the OV rising threshold, a fault signal is generated that disables the linear current regulator and results in the GATE pin being pulled low. The voltage f ault signal is time filtered so that faults \nof a duration less than the UV glitch filter time (0.6 ms) and OV \nglitch filter time (5 µs) do not force the gate drive low. The filter oper ates only on the faulting edge, that is, on a high -to-low \ntransition on the undervoltage monitor and on a low -to-high \ntransition on the overvoltage monitor . \n04488-0331.93V\n868mV\nUNDE RVOLTAGE\nDETEC TOROVE RVOLTAGE\nDETEC TOR\nADM1073FET DRIVE\nENABLESPLYGD–48V RTN\n–48V INR4R3\nR2R1OV\nUVVIN\n \nFigure 33. Undervoltage and Overvoltage Circuitry  \n(Standard 4 -Resistor Configuration)  \nThe operating voltage window is determined by select ing the \nresistor ratios R 1/R2 and R3/R4 . These resistor networks form \ntwo resistor dividers that generate the voltages at the UV and OV pin s, which are proportional to the supply voltage. By \nchoosing these ratios carefully, the user can program the ADM1073 to a pply the supply voltage to the load only when it is \nwithin specific thresholds. Note that 1% tolerance resistors \nshould always be used to maintain the accuracy of the pro -\ngrammed thresholds.  \nData Sheet  ADM1073  \n \nRev. B | Page 17 of 24 UV (Undervoltage)  \nThe voltage on the UV pin is compared to an in ternal 0.868 V \nreference. For the implementation in Figure 33 , the undervolt -\nage level is then set as  \nVUV = 0.868 × ( R1 + R2)/R2 \nIf the UV pin voltage is less than 0.868 V and the comparator \ntrips, an internal 5 µA current sink is turned on. This pulls the  \nUV voltage down by   \nVUVHYST(PIN)  = 5 µA × R1  × R2/(R1 + R2) \nat the UV pin , or by \nVUVHYST(SUPPLY)  = 5 µA × R1                    \nat the supply . \nIn this manner, the user can program the value of the voltage hysteresis by varying the parallel impedance of th e resistor \ndivider. The UV comparator has an internal 0.6 ms time delay to prevent nuisance shutdowns under noisy supply conditions.  \nOV (Overvoltage)  \nThe voltage on the UV pin is compared to an internal 1.93 V reference. For the implementation in Figure 33 , the overvoltage \nlevel is then set as  \nV\nOV = 1.93 × ( R3 + R4)/R4 \nIf the OV pin voltage exceeds 1.93 V and the comparator trips, an internal 5 µA current source is turned on. This pulls the OV voltage up by  \nV\nOVHYST(PIN)  = 5 µA × R3  × R4/(R3 + R4) \nat the OV pin , or by \nVOVHYST(SUPPLY)  = 5 µA × R3  \nat the supply . \n In this manner, the user can program the value of the voltage hysteresis by varying the parallel impedance of the resistor divider. The OV comparator has an internal 5 µs time delay.  \nIf the voltage o n UV or OV goes out of range (below 0.868 V on \nUV or above 1.93V on OV), GATE is pulled low. If the supply subsequently reenters the operating voltage window, the ADM1073 restores the GATE drive.  \nHysteresis must be considered when reentering the operating window, that is, V\nUV must increase above  \n0.868 V + V UVHYST(SUPPLY)   \nwhen recovering from an undervoltage fault, and V OV must \ndrop below  \n1.93 V − V OVHYST(SUPPLY)   \nwhen recovering from an overvoltage fault for GATE to be \nrestored.  \nAlternative UV and OV Configurations  \nA 2-resistor or a 3 -resistor implementation can  also be used to \nset the UV and OV levels (see Figure 34 and Figure  35).  \n \n04488-034ADM1073–48V RTN\n–48V INR2R1 OV\nUV\n \nFigure 34. 2 -Resistor UV/OV Implementation  \n \n04488-035ADM1073–48V RTN\n–48V INR3R1\nR2OV\nUV\n \nFigure 35. 3 -Resistor UV/OV Implementation  \n \n \nADM1073 Data Sheet\n \nRev. B | Page 18 of 24 FUNCTIONALITY AND TIMING \nLIVE INSERTION \nThe timing waveforms associated with the live insertion of a \nplug-in board using the ADM1073 are shown in Figure 36. The \nlong connector pins are the first to make connection, and the GND − V\nEE potential climbs to 48 V . As this voltage is applied, \nthe voltage at the V IN pin ramps to a constant 12.3 V and is held \nat this level with the shunt resistor and external resistor combination at the V\nIN pin. In this case, the connection pins are \nstaggered so that the R1/R2 and R3/R4 resistor dividers are the last to connect to the backplane. This means that V\nUV and V OV \nbegin to ramp after the other pins connect. Note that staggered \nconnector pins are optional, because an internal time filter is \nincluded on the UV pin. \nWhen V UV crosses the undervoltage rising threshold, it is now \ninside the operating voltage window and the −48 V supply must \nbe applied to the load. The SPLYGD  output is asserted and after \na time delay, t POR, the ADM1073 begins to ramp up the gate \ndrive. When the voltage on the SENSE pin reaches 100 mV (the \nanalog current limit level), the gate drive is held constant. When the board capacitance is fully charged, the sense voltage begins to drop below the analog current limit voltage and the gate \nvoltage is free to ramp up further. The gate voltage eventually \nclimbs to its maximum value of 12.3 V and the PWRGD\n output \nis asserted. Figure 37 shows some typical startup waveforms. \ntPORVLKO\nVUVR–48V RTN – VEE\nVIN\nVUV\nGATE\nSENSE\nVOUT\nSPLYGD\nPWRGD\n04488-036 \nFigure 36.

B | Page 20 of 24 CURRENT FAULTS  \nSome timing waveforms associated with overcurrent faults are \nshown in the following figures. Figure 43 shows  how a perma -\nnent current fault is dealt with after startup. SPLYGD  going low \nindicates when the supply voltage is good. Because the output is \nshorted, the sense voltage immediately rises through the 90  mV \ncircuit breaker threshold , and the fault timer is started. The \nlinear current control loop then goes into regulation at V SENSE = \n100 mV , accurately limiting the load current at the preset level. \nThe limited consecutive retry scheme PWMs the GATE p in \nseven  times. When the seventh ret ry occurs, the permanent \nfault is deemed permanent and the part latches off. The \nLATCHED  output asserts at this time. Power must now be \ncycled to restart the device. This can be achieved via a manual card reseating  event (which cycle s the power)  or with an \nexternal \nRESTART  or SHDN  signal. \n04488-043 \nFigure 43. Timing Waveforms Associated with a Current Fault at Startup, \nUsing Limited Consecutive Retry  (Ch1 = GATE; Ch2 = SE NSE;  \nCh3 = SPLYGD ; Ch4 = LATCHED ) \nNote that the LATCHED  output can also be tied back to the \nRESTART  input, giving an infinite retry during current fault \nwith a 5 -second cool -down period after every seven retries. The \nwaveforms for this event are similar to th ose in Figure 43, but \nrepeat s every five seconds.  \nFigure 44 shows the behavior of ADM1073 when a temporary \ncurrent fault occurs followed by a permanent current fault. \nWhen the first overcurrent fault occurs, the first 97.5 mV spike on the SENSE line can be seen. The ADM1073 retries a number of times, and during the fifth t\nOFF time this current fault corrects \nitself. After this time period, a no -fault condition is detected \nand the limited consecutive counter is reset. GATE is reasserted.  \nWhen the overcurrent fault returns permanently, the limited \nconsecutive retry counter detects seven  consecutive faults and \nthe part latches off. In this way, the ADM1073 prevents \nnuisance shutdowns caused by transient shorts of a programmable duration (typically ~0.6 s, set via TIMER, as \nfollows ), but provides latched shutdown protection from \npermanently shorted loads.  \n04488-044\n \nFigure 44. Timing Waveforms Associated with a Temporary Current Fault \nFollowed by a Permanent Current Fault  \n(Ch1 = GATE; Ch2 = SENSE)  \nFigure 45 shows the behavior of the TIMER pin during a retry \ncycle. Different c urrent sources are switched in during the \non-time (TIMER ramping up) and off -times (TIMER ramping \ndown). This can be seen in the varying ramp -up and ramp -\ndown rates of TIMER below. The default ratio of t ON to t OFF is \n6%. This ratio can be reduced with a re sistor from TIMER to \nVEE or increased with a resistor from TIMER to V IN. The total \nretry period can be extended or reduced by changing the value \nof the TIMER capacitor.  \n04488-045\n \nFigure 45.
