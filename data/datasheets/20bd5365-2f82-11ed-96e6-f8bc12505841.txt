J | Page 3  of 20 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  line of driver/receiver products is designed to  fully \nmeet the EIA -232 standard while operating with a single  2.7 V \nto 3.6 V power supply. The devices feature an on -board  charge \npump dc -to-dc converter, eliminat ing the need for dual  power \nsupplies. This dc -to-dc converter contains a voltage  tripler and a \nvoltage inverter that internally generates positive  and negative \nsupplies from the input 3 V power supply. The dc -to-dc \nconverter operates in Green Idle™  mode, w hereby the charge \npump oscillator is gated on  and off to maintain the output \nvoltage at ± 7.25 V under varying load conditions. This \nminimizes  the power consumption and makes these products \nideal for  battery -powered portable devices.  \nThe ADM3307E /ADM 3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  devices are suitable for operation in  harsh electrical \nenvironments and contain ESD protection up to ± 15 kV on \ntheir RS -232 lines ( ADM3310E , ADM3311E , ADM3312E , and \nADM3315E ). The ADM3307E  contains ESD protection up to \n±15 kV on all I/O lines (CMOS, RS -232, EN, and SD).  \nA shutdown facility that reduces the power consumption to 66 nW \nis also  provided. While in shutdown, one receiver remains active \n(two receivers active with ADM3310E ), thereby allowing monitor-\ning of peripheral devices. This feature allows the device to be shut \ndown until a peripheral device begins communication.  \nThe active receiver can alert the processor, which can then take the ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  device out of the shutdown mode.  \nThe ADM3307E  contains five drivers and three receivers and is  \nintended for mobile phone data lump cables and portable computing  applications.  \nThe ADM3311E  contains three drivers  and five receivers and is  \nintended for serial port applications on notebook/laptop \ncomputers.  \nThe ADM3310E  is a low current version of the ADM3311E . \nThis  device also allows two receivers to be active in shutdown \nmode.  \nThe ADM3312E  contains three drivers and three receivers and \nis intended for serial port applications, PDAs, mobile phone \ndata lump cables, and other hand -held devices.  The ADM3315E  is a low current version of the ADM3312E , \nwith a 22 k Ω receiver  input resistance that reduces th e drive \nrequirements of the DTE. Its main applications are PDAs, \npalmtop computers, and mobile phone data lump cables.  \nThe ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  devices are fabricated using CMOS technology  for \nminimal power consumption. All parts feature a high level of \novervoltage protection and latch -up immunity.  \nAll ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  devices are available in a 32 -lead 5 mm ×  5 mm  \nLFCSP _WQ  and in a TSSOP ( ADM3307E , ADM3310E , and \nADM3311E  in a 28 -lead TSSOP; ADM3312E  and ADM3315E  \nin a 24 -lead TSSOP). The ADM3311E  also comes in a 28 -lead \nSSOP .  \nThe ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  devices are ruggedized RS -232 line \ndrivers/receivers that operate from a single supply of 2.7 V to \n3.6 V .  Step -up voltage converters coupled with level shifting \ntransmitters  and receivers allow RS -232 levels to be developed \nwhile operating  from a single supply. Features include low \npower con sumption,  Green Idle operation, high transmission \nrates, and compatibility  with the EU directive on electromag -\nnetic compatibility. This EM  compatibility directive includes \nprotection against radiated and  conducted interference, \nincluding high levels of el ectrostatic  discharge.  \nAll RS -232 (and CMOS, SD, and EN for ADM3307E ) inputs and \noutputs are protected against electrostatic discharges (up to \n±15 kV). This ensures compliance with IEC 1000- 4-2 \nrequirements.  \nThese devices are ideally suited for operation in electrically \nharsh  environments or where RS -232 cables are frequently \nbeing  plugged/unplugged. They are also immune to high RF \nfield  strengths without special shielding precautions.  \nEmissions are also controlled to within very strict limits. CMOS  \ntechnology is used to keep the power dissipation to an absolute  \nminimum, allowing maximum battery life in portable \napplications.  \n \nADM3307E/ADM3310E/ADM3311E/ADM3312E/ADM3315E  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

These  \ninclude the following:  \n• A charge pump voltage converter  \n• 3.3 V logic to EIA -232 transmitters  \n• EIA-232 to 3.3 V logic receivers  \n• Transient protection circuit on all I/O  lines  \nCharge Pump DC- to-DC Voltage Converter  \nThe charge pump voltage converter consists of a 250 kHz (300  kHz \nfor ADM3307E ) oscillator and a switching matrix. The conv erter \ngenerates a ±9 V supply from the input 3.0 V level. This is done in \ntwo stages using a switched capacitor technique . First, the 3.0 V \ninput supply is tripled to 9.0 V using Capacitor C4 as the charge \nstorage element. The +9.0 V level is then inverted  to generate −9.0 \nV using C5 as the storage element.  \nHowever, it should be noted that, unlike other charge pump dc -\nto-dc converters, the charge pump on the ADM3307E  does not \nrun open -loop. The output voltage is regulated to ± 7.25 V (or \n±6.5 V  for the ADM3310E  and ADM3315E ) by the Green Idle \ncircuit  and never reaches ± 9 V in practice. This saves power as \nwell as maintains a more constant output voltage.  \n+\nGNDC2 C1S1\nS2S3\nS4C4\nVCCS5S6\nS7+ +V+=3VCCVCC\nINTERNA L\nOSCILLATORVCC\n02915-024 \nFigure 24. Charge Pump Voltage Tripler \nThe tripler operates in two phas es. During the oscillator low  \nphase, S1 and S2 are closed and C1 charges rapidly to VCC. S3, \nS4, and S5 are open, and S6 and S7 are closed.  \nDuring the oscillator high phase, S1 and S2 are open, and S3  \nand S4 are closed, so the voltage at the output of S3 i s 2VCC. This \nvoltage is used to charge C2. In the absence of any discharge  \ncurrent, C2 charges up to 2VCC after several cycles. During the \noscillator high phase, as previously mentioned, S6  and S7 are \nclosed, so the voltage at the output of S6 is 3VCC. This voltage is \nthen used to charge C3.

Charge Pump Voltage Inverter During the oscillator high phase, S10 and S11 are open, while  \nS8 and S9 are closed. C3 is charged to 3VCC from the output of  \nthe voltage tripler over several cycles. During the oscillator low  \nphase, S8 and S9 are open, while S10 and S11 are closed. C3 is  \nconnected across C5, whose positive terminal is grounded and  \nwhose negative t erminal is the V − output. Over several cycles, \nC5 charges to − 3 VCC. \nThe V+ and V − supplies may also be used to power external  \ncircuitry if the current requirements are small. See Figure 12 in \nthe Typical P erformance Characteristics  section.  \nWhat Is Green Idle?  \nGreen Idle is a method of minimizing power consumption \nunder  idle (no transmit) conditions while still maintaining the \nability to  transmit data instantly.  \nHow Does it Work?  \nCharge pump type dc -to-dc converters used in RS -232 line \ndrivers  normally operate open -loop,  that is , the output voltage \nis not regulated  in any way. Under light load conditions, the \noutput voltage  is close to twice the supply voltage for a doubler \nand three times  the supply voltage for a tripler, with very little \nripple. As the load  current increases, the output voltage falls and \nthe ripple voltage  increases.  \nEven under no -load conditions, the oscillator and charge pump  \noperate at a very high frequency with consequent switching \nlosses and current drain.  \nGreen Idle works by monitoring the output voltage and maintaining  it at a constant value of around 7 V\n1. When the \nvoltage rises  above 7.25 V2 the oscillator is turned off. When the \nvoltage falls below 7 V1, the oscillator is turned o n and a burst of \ncharging  pulses is sent to the reservoir capacitor. When the \noscillator is  turned off, the power consumption of the charge \npump is virtually  zero, so the average current drain under light \nload conditions  is greatly reduced.  \n \n \n1 For ADM3310E  and ADM3315E , replace with 6.5 V.  \n2 For ADM3310E  and ADM3315E , replace with 6.25 V.  \n   \n \n  \nADM3307E/ADM3310E/ADM3311E/ADM3312E/ADM3315E  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

If either V+  \nor V − fall below 7 V1, the oscillator starts up until the  voltage \nrises above 7.25 V2. \nTRAN SCEIVERS\nSTART/STOPSTART/STOP\nV+\nV–SHUTDOWNCHAR GE\nPUMP\nV–VOLTAGE\nCOMPARA TOR\nWITH250m V\nHYSTERESISBAND  GAP\nVOLTAGE\nREFERENCEV+VOLTAGE\nCOMPARA TOR\nWITH250m V\nHYSTERESIS\n02915-026 \nFigure 26. Block Diagram of Green Id le Circuit  \nThe operation of Green Idle for V+ under various load \nconditions  is illustrated in Figure 27. Under light load \nconditions, C1 is  maintained in a charged condition, and only a \nsingle oscillator  pulse is required to charge  up C2. Under these \nconditions, V+  may actually overshoot 7.25 V2 slightly.  \nOSCV+OVERSHOOT\nLIGHT\nLOAD7.25V1\n7V2\nOSCV+7.25V1\n7V2\nOSCV+7.25V1\n7V2MED IUM\nLOAD\nHEAVY\nLOAD\n1FORADM3310 EAND ADM3315 EREPLACEWITH6.5V.\n2FORADM3310 EAND ADM3315 EREPLACEWITH6.25V.\n02915-027 \nFigure 27. Operation of Green Idle under Various Load Conditions  Under medium load conditions, it may take several cycles for \nC2 to charge up to 7.25 V2. The average frequency of the \noscillator is higher because there are more pulses in each burst \nand the  bursts of pulses are closer together and more frequent.  \nUnder high load conditions, the oscillator is on continuously if  \nthe charge pump output cannot r each 7.25 V2. \nGreen Idle Vs . Shutdown  \nShutdown mode minimizes power consumption by shutting down  the charge pump altogether. In this mode, the switches in \nthe voltage tripler are configured so V+ is connected directly to \nV\nCC. V− is zero because there is no charge pump operation to \ncharge C5.  This means there is a delay when coming out of \nshutdown mode  before V+ and V − achieve their normal \noperating voltages. Green  Idle maintains the transmitter supply \nvoltages under transmitter  idle conditions so this delay does not \noccur.  \nDoesn’t Green Idle  Increase Supply Voltage Ripple?  \nThe ripple on the output voltage of a charge pump operating in  \nopen -loop depends on three factors: the oscillator frequency, \nthe value of the reservoir capacit or, and the load current. The \nvalue of  the reservoir capacitor is fixed. Increasing the oscillator \nfrequency  decreases the ripple voltage; decreasing the oscillator \nfrequency  increases it. Increasing the load current increases the \nripple voltage; decreasin g the load current decreases it. The \nripple voltage  at light loads is naturally lower than that for high \nload currents.  \nUsing Green Idle, the ripple voltage is determined by the high \nand low thresholds of the Green Idle circuit. These are \nnominally 7 V1 and 7.25 V2, so the ripple is 250 mV under most \nload conditions.  With very light load conditions, there may  be \nsome overshoot  above 7.25 V2, so the ripple is slightly greater. \nUnder heavy load  conditions where the output never reaches \n7.25 V2, the Green Idle circuit is inoperative and the ripple \nvoltage is determined by the load current, the same as in a \nnormal charge pump.  \nWhat about Electromagnetic Compatibility?  \nGreen Idle does not operate with a constant oscillator frequency.  As a result, the frequency an d spectrum of the \noscillator signal vary  with load. Any radiated and conducted \nemissions also vary accordingly.  Like other Analog Devices  \nRS-232 transceiver products, the  ADM3307E /ADM3310E / \nADM3311E /ADM3312E /ADM3315E  devices feature slew rate \nlimiting and other techniques  to minimize radiated and \nconducted emissions. \n \n1 For ADM3310E  and ADM3315E , replace with 6.5 V.  \n2 For ADM3310E  and ADM3315E , replace with 6.25 V.  \nData Sheet  ADM3307E/ADM3310E/ADM3311E/ADM3312E/ADM3315E  \n \nRev. J | Page 15 of 20 Transmitter (Driver) Section  \nThe drivers convert 3.3 V logic input levels into EIA -232 output  \nlevels. With VCC = 3.0 V and driving an EIA -232 load, the  output  \nvoltage swing is typically ± 6.4 V (or ± 5.5 V for ADM3310E  and \nADM3315E ). \nUnused inputs may be left unconnected, because  an internal \n400 kV  pull-up resistor pulls them high forcing the outputs into \na low  state. The input pull -up resistors typica lly source 8 mA \nwhen  grounded, so unused inputs should either be connected to \nVCC or left unconnected in order to minimize power consumption.  \nReceiver Section  \nThe receivers are inverting level shifters that accept RS -232 \ninput  levels and translate them int o 3.3 V logic output levels. \nThe inputs  have internal 5 kΩ  pull-down resistors (22 k Ω for \nthe ADM3310E ) to ground and are also protected against \novervoltages of up to ± 30 V .  Unconnected inputs are pulled to  \n0 V by the intern al 5 k Ω (or 22 kΩ for the ADM3315E ) pull -\ndown resistor. This, therefore, results in a Logic 1 output level \nfor unconnected inputs or for  inputs connected to GND.  \nThe re ceivers have Schmitt trigger inputs with a hysteresis level \nof 0.14 V . This ensures error -free reception for both noisy \ninputs  and for inputs with slow transition times.  \nENABLE AND SHUTDOWN  \nThe enable function is intended to facilitate data bus  connections  \nwhere it is desirable to three- state the receiver outputs. In the  \ndisabled mode, all receiver outputs are placed in a high \nimpedance  state. The shutdown function is intended to shut the \ndevice  down, thereby minimizing the quiescent current. In \nshutdown,  all transmitters are disabled. All receivers are shut \ndown, except  for Receiver R3 ( ADM3307E , ADM3312E , and \nADM3315E ), Receiver R5 ( ADM3311E ), and R eceiver R4 an d \nReceiver R5 (ADM3310E ). Note that disabled transmitters are \nnot three -stated in shutdown,  so it is not permitted to connect \nmultiple (RS -232) driver outputs  together.  \nThe shutdown feature is very useful in battery -operated systems  \nbecause  it reduces the power consumption to 66 nW . During \nshutdown,  the charge pump is also disabled. When exiting \nshutdown, the charge pump is restarted and it takes  approximately \n100 µs for it to reach its steady -state operating conditions.  \n0V3V\nEN INPUT\ntDR\nVOH–0.1V\nVOL+0.1VVOH\nVOLRECEIVER\nOUTPUT\n02915-028 \nFigure 28.

Receiver Enable Timing  \nHigh Baud Rate  \nThe ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E feature high slew rates, permitting data  transmission  \nat rates well in excess of the EIA /RS-232E specifications.  RS-232 \nvoltage levels are maintained at data rates up to 230 kbps (460 kbps for ADM3307E) under worst -case loading conditions.  This allows \nfor high speed data links between two terminals.  \nLAYOUT AND SUPPLY DE COUPLING  \nBecause of the high frequencies at which the ADM3307E / \nADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E /ADM3315E  oscillator  \noperates, particular care should be taken with printed circuit board layout, with all traces being as short as possible and C1 to  \nC3 being connected as close to the device as possible. The use of \na ground plane under and around the device is also highly  \nrecommended.  \nWhen the oscillator starts up during Green Idle operation, large  \ncurrent pulses are taken from V\nCC. For this reason, VCC should \nbe decoupled with a parallel combination of 10 µF tantalum and \n0.1 µF ceramic capacitors, mounted as close to the VCC pin as  \npossible. \nCapacitor C1 to Capacitor C3 can have values between 0.1 µF and \n1 µF . Larger values give lower ripple. These capacitors can be either \nelectrolytic capacitors chosen for low equivalent series resistance \n(ESR) or nonpolarized types, but the use of ceramic types is highly recommended. If polarized electrolytic capacitors are used, polarity must be observed (as shown by C1+).  \nESD/EFT TRANSIE NT PROTECTION SCHEME  \nThe ADM3307E /ADM3310E /ADM3311E /ADM3312E / \nADM3315E  use protective clamping structures on all inputs and \noutputs that clamp the voltage to a safe level and dissipate the energy present in ESD (electrostatic) and EFT (electrical fast transients) discharges. A simplified schematic of the protection structure i s shown in Figure 30 and Figure 31 (see Figure 32 and \nFigure 33 for ADM3307E  protection structure).  \nEach input and output contains two back -to-back high speed  \nclamping diodes. During normal operation with maximum RS -232 \nsignal levels, the diodes have no effect as one or the other is reverse biased depend ing on the polarity of the signal. If, however, the  \nvoltage exceeds about ±50 V , reverse breakdown occurs and the \nvoltage is clamped at this level. The diodes are large p -n junctions \ndesigned to handle the instantaneous current surge that can exceed several amperes.  \nADM3307E/ADM3310E/ADM3311E/ADM3312E/ADM3315E Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The receiver outputs (CMOS outputs), \nthe SD and EN\n pins, contain a single reverse biased high speed \nclamping diode. Under normal operation with maximum CMOS signal levels, the receiver output, SD, and EN\n protection \ndiodes have no effect because they are reversed biased. If, \nhowever, the voltage exceeds about 15 V , reverse breakdown \noccurs and the voltage is clamped at this level. If the voltage \nreaches −0.7 V , the diode is forward biased and the voltage is clamped at this level. The receiver inputs can also dissipate some of the energy through the internal 5 kΩ resistor to GND \nas well as through the protection diodes. \nRIND1\nD3\nD2RECEIVER\nINPUTRECEIVER\nOUTPUTRx\n02915-032 \nFigure 32.

ADM3307E Transmitter Output Protection Scheme \nThe protection structures achieve ESD protection up to ±15 kV \non all RS-232 I/O lines (and all CMOS lines, including SD and \nEN for the ADM3307E ). For methods used to test the \nprotection scheme, see the ESD Testing (IEC 1000-4-2) section. ESD TESTING (IEC 1000-4-2) \nIEC 1000-4-2 (previously 801-2) specifies compliance testing \nusing two coupling methods, contact discharge and air-gap \ndischarge. Contact discharge calls for a direct connection to the unit being tested. Airgap discharge uses a higher test voltage but \ndoes not make direct contact with the unit under testing. With \nair discharge, the discharge gun is moved toward the unit under testing, which develops an arc across the air gap, thus the term air discharge. This method is influenced by humidity, temperature, barometric pressure, distance, and rate of closure of the discharge gun. The contact discharge method, while less \nrealistic, is more repeatable and is gaining acceptance in \npreference to the air-gap method. \nAlthough very little energy is contained within an ESD pulse, \nthe extremely fast rise time coupled with high voltages can \ncause failures in unprotected semiconductors. Catastrophic destruction can occur immediately as a result of arcing or heating. Even if catastrophic failure does not occur immediately, the device can suffer from parametric degradation that can result in degraded performance. The cumulative effects of continuous exposure can eventually lead to complete failure. \nI/O lines are particularly vulnerable to ESD damage. Simply \ntouching or plugging in an I/O cable can result in a static \ndischarge that can damage or completely destroy the interface \nproduct connected to the I/O port. Traditional ESD test methods, such as the MIL-STD-883B method 3015.7, do not fully test a product’s susceptibility to this type of discharge. This test was intended to test a product’s susceptibility to ESD damage during handling.  \nEach pin is tested with respect to ground. There are some \nimportant differences between the traditional test and the IEC \ntest. \n\uf0b7 The IEC test is much more stringent in terms of discharge \nenergy. The peak current injected is over four times \ngreater. \n\uf0b7 The current rise time is significantly faster in the IEC test. \n\uf0b7 The IEC test is carried out while power is applied to the \ndevice. \nIt is possible that the ESD discharge could induce latch-up in the device under test. This test, therefore, is more representative \nof a real world I/O discharge where the equipment is operating \nnormally with power applied. For maximum peace of mind, \nhowever, both tests should be performed, ensuring maximum \nprotection both during handling and later during field service. \nData Sheet ADM3307E/ADM3310E/ADM3311E/ADM3312E/ADM3315E\n \nRev.
