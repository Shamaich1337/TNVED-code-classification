It is primarily intended for in-\nvehicle sub-networks using baud rates from 1 kBd up to 20 kBd (/20 and B variants) and\nis compliant with LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and ISO 17987-4:2016\n(12 V). The TJA1021 is pin-to-pin compatible with the TJA1020 and MC33662(B).\nThe transmit data stream of the protocol controller at the transmit data input (TXD) is\nconverted by the TJA1021 into a bus signal with optimized slew rate and wave shaping\nto minimize ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME). The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH\nvia an internal termination resistor. For a commander application, an external resistor in\nseries with a diode should be connected between pin INH or pin V BAT and pin LIN. The\nreceiver detects the data stream at the LIN bus input pin and transfers it via pin RXD to\nthe microcontroller.\nIn Sleep mode, the power consumption of the TJA1021 is very low. In failure modes, the\npower consumption is reduced to a minimum.\n2Features and benefits\n2.1 General\n•LIN 2.x/ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V)/SAE J2602 compliant\n•Baud rate up to 20 kBd (/20 and B variants)\n•Very low ElectroMagnetic Emission (EME)\n•High ElectroMagnetic Immunity (EMI)\n•Passive behavior in unpowered state\n•Input levels compatible with 3.3 V and 5 V devices\n•Integrated termination resistor for LIN responder applications\n•Wake-up source recognition (local or remote)\n•K-line compatible\n•Pin-to-pin compatible with TJA1020 and MC33662(B)\n•Available in SO8 and HVSON8 packages\n•Leadless HVSON8 package (3.0 mm × 3.0 mm) with low thermal resistance supporting\nAutomated Optical Inspection (AOI) capability\n2.2 Low power management\n•Very low current consumption in Sleep mode with local and remote wake-up\nNXP SemiconductorsTJA1021\nISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver\n2.3 Protection mechanisms\n•High ESD robustness: ±6 kV according to IEC 61000-4-2 for pins LIN, V BAT and\nWAKE_N\n•Transmit data (TXD) dominant time-out function\n•Bus terminal and battery pin protected against transients in the automotive environment\n(ISO 7637)\n•Bus terminal short-circuit proof to battery and ground\n•Thermally protected\n3Quick reference data\nSymbol Parameter Conditions Min Typ Max Unit\nVBAT battery supply voltage limiting value with respect to GND -0.3 - +40 V\nSleep mode; V LIN = V BAT; VWAKE_N  = V BAT ;\nVTXD = 0 V; V SLP_N  = 0 V2 7 10 μA\nStandby mode; bus recessive\nVINH = V BAT; VLIN = V BAT; VWAKE_N  = V BAT;\nVTXD = 0 V; V SLP_N  = 0 V150 450 1000 μA\nStandby mode; bus dominant\nVBAT = 12 V; V INH = 12 V; V LIN = 0 V;\nVWAKE_N  = 12 V; V TXD = 0 V; V SLP_N  = 0 V300 800 1200 μA\nNormal mode; bus recessive\nVINH = V BAT; VLIN = V BAT; VWAKE_N  = V BAT;\nVTXD = 5 V; V SLP_N  = 5 V300 800 1600 μAIBAT battery supply current\nNormal mode; bus dominant\nVBAT = 12 V; V INH = 12 V; V WAKE_N  = 12 V;\nVTXD = 0 V; V SLP_N  = 5 V1 2 4 mA\nVLIN voltage on pin LIN limiting value with respect to GND, V BAT and\nVWAKE_N-40 - +40 V\nTvj virtual junction temperature limiting value -40 - +150 °CTable 1.\u2007Quick reference data\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

The TJA1021 is LIN 2.0, LIN\n2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V) compliant and provides\noptimum ElectroMagnetic Compatibility (EMC) performance due to wave shaping of the\nLIN output.\nThe LIN physical layer is independent of higher OSI model layers (e.g., the LIN\nprotocol). Consequently, nodes containing an ISO 17987-compliant physical layer can\nbe combined, without restriction, with LIN physical layer nodes that comply with earlier\nrevisions (LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3, LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 and LIN 2.2A).\nThe TJA1021T(K)/20 and TJA1021B(K) are optimized for the maximum specified LIN\ntransmission speed of 20 kBd; the TJA1021T(K)/10 and TJA1021AT(K) are optimized for\nthe LIN transmission speed of 10.4 kBd as specified by the SAE J2602.\n7.1 Operating modes\nThe TJA1021 supports modes for normal operation (Normal mode), power-up (Power-\non mode) and very-low-power operation (Sleep mode). An intermediate wake-up mode\nbetween Sleep and Normal modes is also supported (Standby mode). Figure 3  shows\nthe state diagram.\nMode SLP_N TXD (output) RXD INH Transmitter Remarks\nSleep mode 0 weak pull-down floating floating off no wake-up request\ndetected\nStandby[1]\nmode0 weak pull-down if\nremote wake-up;\nstrong pull-down if\nlocal wake-up[2]LOW[3]HIGH off wake-up request\ndetected; in this mode\nthe microcontroller\ncan read the wake-\nup source: remote or\nlocal wake-up\nNormal mode 1 HIGH: recessive state\nLOW: dominant stateHIGH: recessive state\nLOW: dominant stateHIGH Normal mode[2][3][4]\nPower-on mode 0 weak pull-down floating HIGH off[5]Table 4.\u2007Operating modes\n[1] Standby mode is entered automatically upon any local or remote wake-up event during Sleep mode.

As long as TXD is LOW, the transmitter is off. In the event of a short-circuit to ground on pin\nTXD, the transmitter will be disabled.\n[5] Power-on mode is entered after switching on V BAT.\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

Despite its extreme low\ncurrent consumption, the TJA1021 can still be woken up remotely via pin LIN, or woken\nup locally via pin WAKE_N, or activated directly via pin SLP_N. Filters at the inputs of the\nreceiver (LIN), of pin WAKE_N and of pin SLP_N prevent unwanted wake-up events due\nto automotive transients or EMI. All wake-up events must be maintained for a certain time\nperiod (t wake(dom)LIN , twake(dom)WAKE_N  and t gotonorm ).\nSleep mode is initiated by a falling edge on pin SLP_N in Normal mode. To enter Sleep\nmode successfully (INH becomes floating), the sleep command (pin SLP_N = LOW) must\nbe maintained for at least t gotosleep .\nIn Sleep mode the internal responder termination between pins LIN and V BAT is disabled\nto minimize the power dissipation in the event that pin LIN is short-circuited to ground.\nOnly a weak pull-up between pins LIN and V BAT is present.\nSleep mode can be activated independently from the actual level on pin LIN, pin TXD or\npin WAKE_N. This guarantees that the lowest power consumption is achievable even in\ncase of a continuous dominant level on pin LIN or a continuous LOW on pin WAKE_N.\nWhen V BAT drops below the power-on-reset threshold V th(POR)L , the TJA1021 enters\nSleep mode.\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

These wake-up events activate pin INH and enable the\nresponder termination resistor at the pin LIN. As a result of the HIGH condition on pin\nINH the voltage regulator and the microcontroller can be activated.\nStandby mode is signalled by a LOW-level on pin RXD which can be used as an interrupt\nfor the microcontroller.\nIn Standby mode (pin SLP_N is still LOW), the condition of pin TXD (weak pull-down or\nstrong pull-down) indicates the wake-up source: weak pull-down for a remote wake-up\nrequest and strong pull-down for a local wake-up request.\nSetting pin SLP_N HIGH during Standby mode results in the following events:\n•An immediate reset of the wake-up source flag; thus releasing the possible strong pull-\ndown at pin TXD before the actual mode change (after t gotonorm ) is performed\n•A change into Normal mode if the HIGH level on pin SLP_N has been maintained for a\ncertain time period (t gotonorm )\n•An immediate reset of the wake-up request signal on pin RXD\n7.4 Normal mode\nIn Normal mode the TJA1021 is able to transmit and receive data via the LIN bus line.\nThe receiver detects the data stream at the LIN bus input pin and transfers it via pin RXD\nto the microcontroller (see Figure 1 ): HIGH at a recessive level and LOW at a dominant\nlevel on the bus. The receiver has a supply-voltage related threshold with hysteresis and\nan integrated filter to suppress bus line noise. The transmit data stream of the protocol\ncontroller at the TXD input is converted by the transmitter into a bus signal with optimized\nslew rate and wave shaping to minimize EME. The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH\nvia an internal responder termination resistor. For a commander application an external\nresistor in series with a diode should be connected between pin INH or V BAT on one side\nand pin LIN on the other side (see Figure 7 ).\nWhen in Sleep, Standby or Power-up mode, the TJA1021 enters Normal mode whenever\na HIGH level on pin SLP_N is maintained for a time of at least t gotonorm . The LIN transmit\nand receive functions are enabled after an initialization time, t init(norm) .\nThe TJA1021 switches to Sleep mode in case of a LOW-level on pin SLP_N, maintained\nfor a time of at least t gotosleep .\n7.5 Wake-up\nWhen V BAT exceeds the power-on-reset threshold voltage V th(POR)H , the TJA1021\nenters Power-on mode. Though the TJA1021 is powered-up and INH is HIGH, both\nthe transmitter and receiver are still inactive. If SLP_N = 1 for t > t gotonorm , the TJA1021\nenters Normal mode.\nThere are three ways to wake-up a TJA1021 which is in Sleep mode:\n1.Remote wake-up via a dominant bus state of at least t wake(dom)LIN\n2.Local wake-up via a negative edge at pin WAKE_N\n3.Mode change (pin SLP_N is HIGH) from Sleep mode to Normal mode\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

It should be noted that the time period t wake(dom)LIN  is measured either in\nNormal mode while TXD is HIGH, or in Sleep mode irrespective of the status of pin TXD.\nA falling edge at pin WAKE_N followed by a LOW level maintained for a certain time\nperiod (t wake(dom)WAKE_N ) results in a local wake-up. The pin WAKE_N provides an\ninternal pull-up towards pin V BAT. In order to prevent EMI issues, it is recommended to\nconnect an unused pin WAKE_N to pin V BAT.\nAfter a local or remote wake-up, pin INH is activated (it goes HIGH) and the internal\nresponder termination resistor is switched on. The wake-up request is indicated by a\nLOW active wake-up request signal on pin RXD to interrupt the microcontroller.\n001aae071LIN recessive\nLIN dominant\nSleep mode standby mode0.4VBAT0.6VBAT\ngroundVBAT\nVLIN twake(dom)LIN\nFigure 4.\u2007Remote wake-up behavior\n7.7 Wake-up via mode transition\nIt is also possible to set pin INH HIGH with a mode transition towards Normal mode via\npin SLP_N. This is useful for applications with a continuously powered microcontroller.\n7.8 Wake-up source recognition\nThe TJA1021 can distinguish between a local wake-up request on pin WAKE_N and\na remote wake-up request via a dominant bus state. \'A local wake-up request sets\nthe wake-up source flag. The wake-up source can be read on pin TXD in the Standby\nmode. If an external pull-up resistor on pin TXD to the power supply voltage of the\nmicrocontroller has been added, a HIGH level indicates a remote wake-up request (weak\npull-down at pin TXD) and a LOW level indicates a local wake-up request (strong pull-\ndown at pin TXD; much stronger than the external pull-up resistor).\nThe wake-up request flag (signalled on pin RXD) as well as the wake-up source flag\n(signalled on pin TXD) are reset immediately after the microcontroller sets pin SLP_N\nHIGH.\n7.9 TXD dominant time-out function\nA TXD dominant time-out timer circuit prevents the bus line from being driven to a\npermanent dominant state (blocking all network communication) if pin TXD is forced\npermanently LOW by a hardware and/or software application failure. The timer is\ntriggered by a negative edge on pin TXD. If the duration of the LOW-level on pin TXD\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

The timer is reset by a positive edge on pin TXD.\n7.10 Fail-safe features\nPin TXD provides a pull-down to GND in order to force a predefined level on input pin\nTXD in case the pin TXD is unsupplied.\nPin SLP_N provides a pull-down to GND in order to force the transceiver into Sleep\nmode in case the pin SLP_N is unsupplied.\nPin RXD is set floating in case of lost power supply on pin V BAT.\nThe current of the transmitter output stage is limited in order to protect the transmitter\nagainst short circuit to pins V BAT or GND.\nA loss of power (pins V BAT and GND) has no impact on the bus line and the\nmicrocontroller. There are no reverse currents from the bus. The LIN transceiver can be\ndisconnected from the power supply without influencing the LIN bus.\nThe output driver at pin LIN is protected against overtemperature conditions. If the\njunction temperature exceeds the shutdown junction temperature T j(sd), the thermal\nprotection circuit disables the output driver. The driver is enabled again when the junction\ntemperature has dropped below T j(sd) and a recessive level is present at pin TXD.\nIf VBAT drops below V th(VBATL)L , a protection circuit disables the output driver. The driver is\nenabled again when V BAT > V th(VBATL)H  and a recessive level is present at pin TXD.\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V.

When handling ensure that the appropriate precautions are taken as\ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n16Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technology. A more in-depth account\nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow\nsoldering description” .\n16.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached\nto Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides\nboth the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method\nthat is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole\nand Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is\nnot suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high\ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n16.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming\nfrom a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the\nfollowing:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless\npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,\nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,\ndue to an increased probability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by\ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,\npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n16.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2023 NXP B.V. All rights reserved.\nProduct data sheet Rev. 9 — 10 February 2023\n20 / 25\nNXP SemiconductorsTJA1021\nISO 17987/LIN 2.x/SAE J2602 transceiver\n•Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board\ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are\nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\n16.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\n•Lead-free versus SnPb soldering; note that a lead-free reflow process usually leads\nto higher minimum peak temperatures (see Figure 10 ) than a SnPb process, thus\nreducing the process window\n•Solder paste printing issues including smearing, release, and adjusting the process\nwindow for a mix of large and small components on one board\n•Reflow temperature profile; this profile includes preheat, reflow (in which the board\nis heated to the peak temperature) and cooling down. It is imperative that the peak\ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder\npaste characteristic).
