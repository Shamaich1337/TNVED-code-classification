General description\nThe NXS0102 is a 2-bit, dual supply translating transceiver with auto direction sensing, that\nenables bidirectional voltage level translation. It features two 2-bit input-output ports (An and Bn),\none output enable input (OE) and two supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ). VCC(A)  can be supplied at\nany voltage between 1.65 V and 3.6 V and V CC(B)  can be supplied at any voltage between 2.3 V\nand 5.5 V, making the device suitable for translating between any of the voltage nodes (1.8 V,\n2.5 V, 3.3 V and 5.0 V). Pins An and OE are referenced to VCC(A)  and pins Bn are referenced to\nVCC(B) . A LOW level at pin OE causes the outputs to assume a high-impedance OFF-state. This\ndevice is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF circuitry disables\nthe output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the device when it is powered down.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range:\n•VCC(A) : 1.65 V to 3.6 V and V CC(B) : 2.3 V to 5.5 V\n•Maximum data rates:\n•Push-pull: 24 Mbps\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial Power-down mode operation\n•Inputs accept voltages up to 5.5 V\n•ESD protection:\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/Jedec JS-001 Class 2 exceeds 2.5 kV for A port\n•HBM: ANSI/ESDA/Jedec JS-001 Class 3B exceeds 8 kV for B port\n•CDM: ANSI/ESDA/Jedec JS-002 Class C3 exceeds 1.5 kV\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78B Class II\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and -40 °C to +125 °C\n3.

Application information\n13.1.  Applications\nVoltage level-translation applications. The NXS0102 can be used in point-to-point applications to\ninterface between devices or systems operating at different supply voltages. The device is primarily\ntargeted at I2C or 1-wire which use open-drain drivers, it may also be used in applications where\npush-pull drivers are connected to the ports, however the NXB0102 may be more suitable.\naaa-031 1041.8 V 3.3 V\nSYSTEM\nCONTROLLER1.8 V 0.1 µF 1 µF 0.1 µF\nDATASYSTEM3.3 V\nDATANXS0102VCC(A) VCC(B)\nGNDB2B1\nA2A1OE\nFig. 10. Typical operating circuit\n13.2.  Architecture\nThe architecture of the NXS0102 is shown in Fig. 11. The device does not require an extra input\nsignal to control the direction of data flow from A to B or B to A.\nVCC(A)\nAOE\nB10 kΩ 10 kΩT1\nT3T2\nONE\nSHOTONE\nSHOTVCC(B)\nGATE BIAS\naaa-030598\nFig. 11.Architecture of NXS0102 I/O cell (one channel)\nThe NXS0102 is a "switch" type voltage translator, it employs two key circuits to enable voltage\ntranslation:\n1.A pass-gate transistor (N-channel) that ties the ports together.\n2.An output edge-rate accelerator that detects and accelerates rising edges on the I/O pins.\nThe gate bias voltage of the pass gate transistor (T3) is set at approximately one threshold voltage\nabove the V CC(A)  level of the low-voltage side. During a rising edge, the one shots turn on the\nPMOS transistors (T1, T2) for a short duration, accelerating the low-to-high transition. The one-shot\nis activated once the input transition reaches approximately 0.5V CCI. During the acceleration time\nthe driver output resistance is between approximately 50 Ω and 70 Ω. To avoid signal contention\nand minimize dynamic I CC, the user should wait for the one-shot circuit to turn-off before applying a\nNXS0102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2021.

Pull-up resistors are included in the device for DC current sourcing\ncapability.\n13.3.  Input driver requirements\nAs the NXS0102 is a switch type translator, properties of the input driver directly effect the output\nsignal. The external open-drain or push-pull driver applied to an I/O determines the static current\nsinking capability of the system. The max data rate, HIGH-to-LOW output transition time (t THL) and\npropagation delay (t PHL) are dependent upon the output impedance and edge-rate of the external\ndriver. The limits provided for these parameters in the datasheet assume a driver with output\nimpedance below 50 Ω is used.\n13.4.  Output load considerations\nThe maximum lumped capacitive load that can be driven is dependant upon the one-shot pulse\nduration. In cases with very heavy capacitive loading there is a risk that the output will not reach\nthe positive rail within the one-shot pulse duration.To avoid excessive capacitive loading and to\nensure correct triggering of the one-shot it\'s recommended to use short trace lengths and low\ncapacitance connectors on NXS0102 PCB layouts. To ensure low impedance termination and\navoid output signal oscillations and one-shot re-triggering, the length of the PCB trace should be\nsuch that the round trip delay of any reflection is within the one-shot pulse duration.\n13.5.  Power up\nDuring operation V CC(A)  must never be higher than V CC(B) , however during power-up\nVCC(A)  ≥ V CC(B)  does not damage the device, so any power supply can be ramped up first. There is\nno special power-up sequencing required. The NXS0102 includes circuitry that disables all output\nports when either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  is switched off.\n13.6.  Enable and disable\nAn output enable input (OE) is used to disable the device. Setting OE to LOW causes all I/Os\nto assume the high-impedance OFF-state. The disable time (t dis with no external load) indicates\nthe delay between when OE goes LOW and when outputs actually become disabled. The enable\ntime (t en) indicates the amount of time the user must allow for one one-shot circuitry to become\noperational after OE is taken HIGH. To ensure the high-impedance OFF-state during power-up or\npower-down, pin OE should be tied to GND through a pull-down resistor, the minimum value of the\nresistor is determined by the current-sourcing capability of the driver.\n13.7.  Pull-up or pull-down resistors on I/O lines\nEach A port I/O has an internal 10 kΩ pull-up resistor to V CC(A) , and each B port I/O has an internal\n10 kΩ pull-up resistor to V CC(B) . If a smaller value of pull-up resistor is required, an external resistor\nmust be added parallel to the internal 10 kΩ, this will effect the VOL level. When OE goes LOW the\ninternal pull-ups of the NXS0102 are disabled.\nNXS0102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2021.

#### Description:
The NXS0102 is a dual supply translating transceiver designed for bidirectional voltage level translation. It features two 2-bit input-output ports (An and Bn), an output enable input (OE), and two supply pins (VCC(A) and VCC(B)). The device allows for seamless communication between devices operating at different voltage levels, making it ideal for interfacing between low-voltage and higher-voltage systems.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Voltage Level Translation:** The NXS0102 is particularly suited for applications requiring voltage level translation between different logic levels, such as interfacing 1.8 V and 3.3 V devices.
- **I2C and 1-Wire Communication:** It is optimized for use in I2C or 1-wire applications that utilize open-drain drivers.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Commonly used in desktop PCs, smartphones, tablets, and other handheld devices where multiple voltage levels are present.

This component is essential for ensuring compatibility between various digital systems, enhancing communication reliability while protecting against potential damage from voltage mismatches.
