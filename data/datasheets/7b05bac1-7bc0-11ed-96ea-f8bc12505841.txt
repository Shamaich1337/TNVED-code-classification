All rights reserved.  Page 5 \n Application Guidelines  \nConducted noise on the input power lines can occur as either \ndifferential -mode or common -mode noise currents. \nDifferential -mode noise is measured between the  two input \nlines, and is found mostly at the low frequency  end of the \nspectrum. This noise shows up as  noise at the  fundamental \nswitching frequency an d its harmonics. Common -mode noise \nis measured  between the input lines and ground and is \nmostly  broadband noise above 10 MHz. The high -frequency  \nnature of common -mode no ise is mostly due to the  high-\nspeed switching transi tions of power train components.  \nEither or both types of noise may be covered in  a \nspecification, as well as a combination of the two.  \n \nDifferential -mode noise is best attenuated using a filter  \ncomposed of line -to-line capacitors (X caps) and series  \ninduc tance, provided by either a discret e inductor or  the \nleakage inductance of a common -mode choke. In  addition to \nthe differential filtering provided by the filter  module, it is \nrecommended that an electroly tic capacitor  be located at the \nconverter side of th e filter to provide  additional atte nuation of \nlow-frequency differential  noise and to provide a low source \nimpedance for the  converter, preventing input filter \noscillations and load  transient  induced inpu t voltage dips.  \n \nOpen -frame DC/DC converter modules and the older metal -\ncased DC/DC con verter modules require slightly different \nfiltering arrangements. The FLT007A0 Z series of modules \nare optimized for the newer open -frame series of modules, \nbut can also be used with older metal -case modules. The \nmain diff erences in filtering recommendation s between the \ntwo types of modules are in common -mode filtering, as \nexplained below.  \n \nFiltering Open -Frame DC/DC Converter \nModules  \nFor filtering open -frame DC/DC conver ter modules, the \nrecommended circuit is shown in Fig . 5. In addition to the \ninput elect rolytic filter capacitor  C1 (recommended value is a \nminimum of 100uF and approximately 1uF/W at power levels \nabove 100W) , common -mode filtering capacitors C2 and C3 \nshou ld be connected between the input and outputs as \nshown. Suitable values for common -mode  capacitors C2 and \nC3 are in the range between 1000pF to 0.1 \uf06dF are usually \nindicated in the DC/DC converter data sheet. These \ncapacitors need to be rated for the isolati on voltage desired  \nbetween the input and output side s of the DC/DC converter \nmodule. The recommended power layout of the modules  \nshowing  where the two common -mode capacitors are to be \nplaced is shown in Fig. 6.   \n     DC/DC \nCONVERTER\n   MODULE \n VI(-)VI(+)\nVO(-)VO(+)\nC1C2\nC3CHASSIS GROUND  FILTER\nMODULEVI(+)\nVI(-)\n \nFigure 5.

The main difference with open -frame module is the \nuse of an isolated shield plane located under neath the \nmodule which is connected  through capacitors C2 through \nC5 to the input and output connections of the module.

Page 7 \n Ther mal Considerations  \nPower modules operate in a variety of thermal environments; \nhowever, sufficient cooling should always be provided to help \nensure reliable operation.   \nConsiderations include ambient temperature, airflow , module \npower dissipation, and the  need for increased reliability. A \nreduction in the operating temperature of the module will \nresult in an increase in reliability.  The thermal data \npresented here is b ased on physical measurements taken in \na wind tunnel.   The test set -up is shown in Fig.  10.

All rights reserved.  Page 8 \n Post solder Cleaning and D rying \nConsiderations  \nPost solder cleaning is usually the final circuit -board \nassembly pr ocess prior to electrical board testing. The result \nof inadequate cleaning and drying can affect both the \nreliability of a power module and the testability of the finis hed \ncircuit -board assembly. For guidance on appropria te \nsoldering, cleaning and drying p rocedures, refer to Lineage \nPower  Board Mounted Power Modules: Soldering and \nCleaning  Application Note.  \nThrough -Hole Lead -Free Soldering \nInformation  \nThe RoHS -compliant through -hole products use the SAC \n(Sn/Ag/Cu) Pb -free solder and RoHS -compliant component s.  \nThey are designed to be processed through single or dual \nwave soldering machines.  The pins have an RoHS -\ncompliant finish that is compatible with both Pb and Pb -free \nwave soldering processes. A maximum preheat rate of  3\uf0b0C/s \nis suggested.  The wave preh eat process should be such \nthat the temperature of the power module board is kept \nbelow 210 \uf0b0C.  For Pb solder, the recommended pot \ntemperature is 260 \uf0b0C, while the Pb -free solder pot is 270 \uf0b0C \nmax.  Not all RoHS -compliant t hrough -hole products can be \nprocess ed with paste -through -hole Pb or Pb -free reflow \nprocess.  If additional information is needed, please consult \nwith your Lineage Power representative for more details.  \n \nSurface Mount Information  \nPick and Place   \nThe FLT007A 0-SRZ SMT modules use an open frame  \nconstruction and are designed for a fully automated \nassembly process.  The modules are fitted with a label \ndesigned to provide a large surface area for pick and place \noperations.  The label meets all the requirements for  surface \nmount processing, as well as safety  standards, and is able to \nwithstand reflow temperatures of up to 300oC.  The label also \ncarries product information such as product code, serial \nnumber and lo cation of manufacture.  \n \nNozzle Recommendations  \nThe mo dule weight has been kept to a mini mum by using \nopen frame construction.  Even so, these modules have a \nrelatively large mass when compared to conventional SMT \ncomponents.  Variables such as nozzle size,  tip style, \nvacuum pressure and pick & placement spee d should be \nconsidered to optimize this process.  The minimum \nrecommended nozzle diameter for reliable operation is 5mm. \nThe maximum nozzle outer diameter, which will safely fit \nwithin the allowable comp onent spacing, is 8 mm max.   \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nTin Lead Soldering  \nThe FLT007A0 -SRZ power modules are lead free modules \nand can be soldered either in a lead -free solder process or in \na conventional Tin/Lead (Sn/Pb) process.  It  is \nrecommended that the customer review d ata sheets in order \nto customize th e solder reflow profile for each application \nboard assembly.  The following instructions must be \nobserved when soldering these units.  Failure to observe \nthese instructions may re sult in the failure of or cause \ndamage to the modules, and can adversely affe ct long -term \nreliability.   \nIn a conventional Tin/Lead (Sn/Pb) solder process peak \nreflow temperatures are limited to less than 235oC.  \nTypically, the eutectic solder melts at 183oC, wets the land, \nand subsequently wicks the device connection.  Sufficient \ntime must be allowed to fuse the plating on the connection to \nensure a reliable solder joint.  There are several types of \nSMT reflow technologies currently used in the industry.  \nThese surface mount power modules can be r eliably \nsoldered using natural forc ed convection, IR (radiant \ninfrared), or a combination of convection/IR.  For reliable \nsoldering the solder reflow profile should be established by \naccurately measuring the module s CP connector \ntemperatures.

C \n(Moisture/Reflow Sensitivity Classification for Nonhermetic \nSolid State Surface Mount Devices) for both Pb -free solder \nprofiles and MSL c lassification procedures.  This standard \nprovides a recommended forced -air-convection reflow profile \nbased on the volume and thickness of the package (table 4 -\n2).  The suggested Pb -free solder paste is Sn/Ag/Cu (SAC). \nThe recommended linear reflow profile using Sn/Ag/Cu \nsolder is shown in Figure. 15. \n \nMSL Rating  \nThe FLT007A0 -SRZ SMT modules have a MSL rating of 1.  \n \nStorage and Handling  \nThe recommended storage environment and handling \nprocedures for moisture -sensitive surface mount packages is \ndetailed in J -STD-033 Rev. A (Handling, Packing, Shippin g \nand Use of Moisture/Reflow Sensit ive Surface Mount \nDevices).  Moisture barrier bags (MBB) with desiccant are \nrequired for MSL ratings of 2 or greater.  These sealed \npackages should not be broken until time of use .  Once the \noriginal package is broken, th e floor life of the product at \ncond itions of <= 30°C and 60% relative humidity varies \naccording to the MSL rating (see J -STD-033A).  The shelf life \nfor dry packed SMT packages will be a minimum of 12 \nmonths from th e bag seal date, when stored at the follow ing \nconditions:  < 40° C, < 90% rel ative humidity.  \n \nPer J-STD-020 Rev.
