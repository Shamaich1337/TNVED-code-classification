Changes in output voltage due to heating effects are covered under the \nspecification for thermal regulation.\n4. Line regulation for the SPX2954 is tested at I L = 1mA.\n5. Dropout voltage is defined as the input to output differential at which the output voltage drops 100mV below its nominal value measured at 1V differential. At very low \nvalues of programmed output voltage, the minimum input supply voltage of 2V (2.3V over temperature) must be taken into account.\n6.

To express \nthese thresholds in terms of output voltage change, multiply by the error amplifier gain = V OUT/VREF = (R1 + R2)/R2. For example, at a programmed output voltage of 5V, \nthe error output is guaranteed to go low when the output drops by 95mV x 5V/1.235 = 384mV.

stability of the SPX2954 requires a 1µF or greater \ncapacitor between output and ground. Oscillation could occur \nwithout this capacitor. Most types of tantalum or aluminum \nelectrolytic works fine here. For operations below -25°C solid \ntantalum is recommended since the many aluminum types \nhave electrolytes that freeze at about -30°C. The ESR of \nabout 5Ω or less and resonant frequency above 500kHz are \nthe most important parameters in the value of the capacitor. \nThe capacitors value may be increased without limit.\nAt lower values of output current, less output capacitance \nis required for stability. For the currents below 10mA the \nvalue of the capacitor can be reduced to 0.33µF and 0.1µF \nfor 1mA. More output capacitance is needed for the 8-pin \nversion at voltages below 5V since it runs the error amplifier \nat lower gain. At worst case 3.3µF or greater must be used \nfor the condition of 150mA load at 1.23V output.\nThe SPX2954 unlike other low dropout regulators will remain \nstable and in regulation with no load in addition to the \ninternal voltage divider. This feature is especially important \nin applications like CMOS RAM keep-alive. When setting \nthe output voltage of the SPX2954 version with external \nresistors, a minimum load of 1µA is recommended.\nIf there is more than 10 inches of wire between the input and \nthe AC filter capacitor or if a battery is used as the input then \na 1µF tantalum or aluminum electrolytic capacitor should be \nplaced from the input to the ground. \nInstability can occur if there is stray capacitance to the \nSPX2954 feedback terminal (pin 7). This could cause more \nproblems when using a higher value of external resistors \nto set the output voltage. This problem can be fixed by \nadding a 100pF capacitor between output and feedback and \nincreasing the output capacitor to at least 3.3µF.\nError Detection Comparator Output\nThe comparator produces a logic low output whenever \nthe  SPX2954 output falls out of regulation by more than \naround 5%. This is around 60mV offset divided by the \n1.235 reference voltage. This trip level remains 5% below \nnormal regardless of the programmed output voltage of the \nregulator.\nFigure 1 shows the timing diagram depicting the ERROR \nsignal and the regulator output voltage as the SPX2954 \ninput is ramped up and down. The ERROR signal becomes \nlow at around 1.3V input, and goes high around 5V input \n(input voltage at which V OUT = 4.75). Since the SPX2954’s \ndropout voltage is load dependent, the input voltage trip \npoint (around 5V) will vary with the load current. The output \nvoltage trip point (approx. 4.75V) does not vary with load.The error comparator has an open-collector output, which \nrequires an external pull-up resistor. Depending on the \nsystem requirements the resistor may be returned to 5V \noutput or other supply voltage. In determining the value of \nthis resistor, note that the output is rated to sink 400mA, \nthis value adds to battery drain in a low battery condition. \nSuggested values range from 100k to 1MΩ. If the output is \nunused this resistor is not required.\n++ +\n+4.75V\nOUTPUT\nVOLTAGE\nERROR*_______\nINPUT\nVOLTAGE 1.3V5.0V\n* See Application Info .\nFigure 1. Error Output Timing\nProgramming the Output Voltage of SPX2954\nThe SPX2954 may be pin-strapped for 5V using its internal \nvoltage divider by tying Pin 1 (output) to Pin 2 (sense) and Pin \n7 (feedback) to Pin 6 (5V Tap). Also, it may be programmed \nfor any output voltage between its 1.235V reference and \nits 30V maximum rating using an external pair of resistors. \nRefer to the below equation for the programming of the \noutput voltage:\nVOUT = V REF x (1 + R 1/R2) + I FB R1\nThe V REF is 1.235 and I FB is the feedback bias current, \nnominally -20nA. The minimum recommended load current \nof 1µA forces an upper limit of 1.2MΩ on value of R 2 . If no \nload is presented the I FB produces an error of typically 2% \nin V OUT which may be eliminated at room temperature by \ntrimming R 1. To improve the accuracy choose the value of \nR2 = 100k this reduces the error by 0.17% and increases \nthe resistor program current by 12µA. Since the SPX2954 \ntypically draws 60µA at no load with Pin 2 open-circuited, \nthis is a small price to pay.\nSPX295410/15\nREV1AReducing Output Noise\nIt may be an advantage to reduce the AC noise present at \nthe output. One way is to reduce the regulator bandwidth by \nincreasing the size of the output capacitor. This is the only \nway that noise can be reduced on the 3 lead SPX2954 but is \nrelatively inefficient, as increasing the capacitor from 1µF to \n220µF only decreases the noise from 430µV to 160µVRMS \nfor a 100kHz bandwidth at 5V output. Noise can be reduced \nfourfold by using a bypass capacitor across R 1, since it \nreduces the high frequency gain from 4 to unity. Pick \nCBYPASS   ≈ (1 / 2πR 1  x 200Hz)\nor choose 0.01µF. When doing this, the output capacitor must \nbe increased to 3.3µF to maintain stability. These changes \nreduce the output noise from 430µV to 100µVRMS for a \n100kHz bandwidth at 5V output. With the bypass capacitor \nadded, noise no longer scales with output voltage so that \nimprovements are more dramatic at higher output voltages.\n470K/uni03A9\n470K/uni03A9ERROR_____\nSDVOUT\nGND+VIN+VIN\nR1 1/uni03BCF\nR238\n5\n1\n4+\nFB\n7VOUT\nSPX2954\nRESET\nFigure 2.
