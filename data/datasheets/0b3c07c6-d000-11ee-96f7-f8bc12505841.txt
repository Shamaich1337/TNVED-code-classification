If you store the products for a long time (more than 6 months), use carefully because the products may \n    be degraded in solderability and/or rusty.\n    Please conﬁrm solderability and characteristics for the \nproducts regularly.\n3. Notice on Product Storage\n  (1) Please do not store the products in a chemical        atmosphere (Acids, Alkali, Bases, Organic gas,        Sulﬁdes and so on), because the characteristics        may be reduced in quality, and/or be degraded in        solderability due to the storage in a        chemical atmosphere.  (2) Please do not put the products directly on the        ﬂoor without anything under them to avoid damp        places and/or dusty places.  (3) Please do not store the products in the places under \ndirect sunlight, heat and vibration.\n  (4) Please use the products immediately after the        package is opened, because the characteristics        may be reduced in quality, and/or be degraded in        solderability due to storage under poor conditions.  (5) Please do not drop the products to avoid cracking        the crystal element.4. Other   Conformal coating or washing of the component is not    acceptable.   Please be sure to consult with our sales representative   or engineer prior to using the products.\nNotice (Rating)\nThe component may be damaged if excess mechanical stress is applied.\nNotice (Handling)\n1. Please conﬁrm circuit the conditions on your set, \nbecause irregular or stop oscillation may occur under unmatched circuit conditions.\n2. Be sure to provide an appropriate fail-safe     function on your product to prevent a second     damage that may be caused by the abnormal     function or the failure of our product.3. Please do not use these products in the following    applications in transportation equipment:     vehicles, trains, ships, etc.      (example: engine control, brake control,     steering control, body control.)Continued from the preceding page.P79E.pdf\nDec. 22,2020!Note \x81 Please read rating and !CAUTION (for storage, operating, rating, soldering, mounting and handling) in this catalog to prevent smoking and/or burning, e tc.\n\x81 This catalog has only typical specifications.

Notice on Product Storage  (1) Please do not store the products in a chemical        atmosphere (Acids, Alkali, Bases, Organic gas,        Sulﬁdes and so on), because the characteristics        may be reduced in quality, and/or be degraded in        solderability due to the storage in a        chemical atmosphere.  (2) Please do not put the products directly on the        ﬂoor without anything under them to avoid damp        places and/or dusty places.  (3) Please do not store the products in the places under \ndirect sunlight, heat and vibration.\n  (4) Please use the products immediately after the        package is opened, because the characteristics        may be reduced in quality, and/or be degraded in        solderability due to storage under poor        conditions.  (5) Please do not drop the products to avoid cracking \n       the crystal element.\n4. Other   Conformal coating or washing of the component is not    acceptable because it is not hermetically sealed.   Please be sure to consult with our sales representative   or engineer whenever and prior to using the products.\nNotice (Rating)\nThe component may be damaged if excess mechanical stress is applied.\nNotice (Handling)\n1. Irregular or stopped oscillation may occur under     unmatched circuit conditions.     Please design your oscillation circuit to get 5     times or more of a negative resistance against     the maximum value of the Equivalent Series     Resistance, that is speciﬁed in order. 2. Be sure to provide an appropriate fail-safe     function on your product to prevent a second     damage that may be caused by the abnormal     function or the failure of our product.Continued from the preceding page.P79E.pdf\nDec. 22,2020!Note \x81 Please read rating and !CAUTION (for storage, operating, rating, soldering, mounting and handling) in this catalog to prevent smoking and/or burning, e tc.\n\x81 This catalog has only typical specifications.
