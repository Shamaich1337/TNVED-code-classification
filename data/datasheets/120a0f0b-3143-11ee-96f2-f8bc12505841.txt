It features two 2-bit input-output ports\n(An and Bn), one output enable input (OE) and two supply pins (V CC(A)  and V CC(B) ).\nBoth supplies can be supplied at any voltage between 1.65 V and 5.5 V. This flexibility\nmakes the device suitable for translating between any of the voltage nodes (1.8 V, 2.5 V,\n3.3 V, and 5.0 V). Pins An and OE are referenced to V CC(A)  and pins Bn are referenced\nto V CC(B) . A LOW level at pin OE causes the outputs to assume a high-impedance OFF-\nstate. This device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The\nIOFF circuitry disables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the\ndevice when it is powered down.\n2Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range:\n–VCC(A) : 1.65 V to 5.5 V and V CC(B) : 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•Maximum data rates:\n–50 Mbit/s\n•IOFF circuitry provides partial power-down mode operation\n•Inputs accept voltages up to 5.5 V\n•ESD protection:\n–HBM JS-001 Class 2 exceeds 2000 V\n–CDM JESD22-C101E exceeds 2000 V\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78B Class II\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from –40 °C to +85 °C\n3Applications\n•I2C/SMBus\n•UART\n•GPIO\nNXP SemiconductorsNTSX2102\nDual supply translating transceiver; open-drain; auto direction sensing\n4Ordering information\nPackage Type number Topside\nmarkingName Description Version\nNTSX2102GU8 sX XQFN8 plastic, extremely thin quad flat package; no\nleads; 8 terminals; body 1.4 × 1.2 × 0.5 mmSOT1309-1\nNTSX2102GD sX2 XSON8 plastic extremely thin small outline package; no\nleads; 8 terminals; body 3 × 2 × 0.5 mmSOT996-2\nNTSX2102TL tX2 XSON8 plastic extremely thin small outline package; no\nleads; 8 terminals; body 3 × 2 × 0.5 mmSOT1052-2Table 1.\u2007Ordering information\n4.1 Ordering options\nType number Orderable part\nnumberPackage Packing\nmethod[1]Minimum order\nquantityTemperature\nNTSX2102GU8 NTSX2102GU8H XQFN8 Reel 7" Q3 NDP 4000 –40 °C to +85 °C\nNTSX2102GD[2]NTSX2102GDH XSON8 Reel 7" Q3 NDP 3000 –40 °C to +85 °C\nNTSX2102TL NTSX2102TLH XSON8 Reel 7" Q3 NDP 4000 –40 °C to +85 °CTable 2.\u2007Ordering options\n[1] Standard packing quantities and other packaging data are available at www.nxp.com/packages/.\n[2] Discontinuation Notice 202111012DN - drop in replacement is NTSX0102TLH.\nThe TL package has a center pad vs no center pad for the GD package. The TL package pad is not electrically connected to the silicon and is not required\nto connect to the PCB so it can drop onto the GD package PCB layout. If the existing GD package has a trace underneath the risk is low since the TL\npackage center pad is not connected to the silicon. If there are multiple traces there could be EMI and cross talk. In both cases the customer needs to\nevaluate risk.\nNote: The length and width are reversed between the "GD" and "TL" package drawings but the shorter edge contains the pins and is 2.0 mm in both\ncases.\n5Functional diagram\nVCC(A)1\n8B2\nB146\n5A2OE\nA1\none shotone shotone shotone shotlevelshifter\naaa-005252VCC(B)\nFigure 1.\u2007Logic symbol\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

Alternatively, it switches on\nthe NMOS transistors (T2, T4) for a HIGH-to-LOW transition. Once activated, the one-\nshot is de-activated after approximately 25 ns (see Figure 11 ). During the acceleration\ntime, the driver output resistance is between approximately 10 Ω and 35 Ω. To avoid\nsignal contention, the application must not exceed the maximum data rate or wait for the\none-shot circuit to turn-off, before applying a signal in the opposite direction.\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

The external open-drain driver applied to an I/O, determines the static\ncurrent sinking capability of the system. The maximum data rate, output transition times\n(tTHL, tTLH) and propagation delays (t PHL, tPLH) are dependent upon the output impedance\nand edge-rate of the external driver.\n13.4 Output load considerations\nThe maximum lumped capacitive load that can be driven is dependent upon the one-shot\npulse duration and has been tuned to 600 pF. In cases with higher capacitive loading,\nthere is a risk that the output does not reach the positive rail within the one-shot pulse\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

To avoid excessive capacitive loading and to ensure correct triggering of the\none-shot, use short trace lengths and low capacitance connectors on NTSX2102 PCB\nlayouts. The length of the PCB trace should be such that the round-trip delay of any\nreflection is within the one-shot pulse duration. Such a length ensures low impedance\ntermination and avoids output signal oscillations and one-shot retriggering.\n13.5 Output enable (OE)\nAn output enable input (OE) is used to disable the device. Setting OE = LOW causes all\nI/Os to assume the high-impedance OFF-state.\n13.6 Power-up\nWhen either of the supplies V CC(n) is at 0 V, outputs are in the high-impedance OFF-\nstate. One of the advantages of NTSX translators is that either V CC(A)  or V CC(B)  may\nbe powered up first. To reduce dissipation during power-up, ensure that output enable\n(OE) is defined. Connect it via a pulldown resistor to GND or, if the application allows,\nhardwired to V CC(A) . If the OE pin is hardwired to V CC(A) , either supply can be powered up\nor down first. If a pulldown is used, the following sequences are recommended.\nFor power-up:\n1.Apply power to either supply pin\n2.Apply power to other supply pin\n3.Enable the device by driving OE HIGH\nFor power down:\n1.Disable the device by driving OE LOW\n2.Remove power from either supply pin\n3.Remove power from other supply pin\n13.7 Pull-up resistors on I/O lines\nEach A port I/O requires a pull-up resistor to V CC(A) , and each B port I/O requires a pull-\nup resistor to V CC(B) . Choose the magnitude of the pull-up resistors to ensure that the\noutput voltage levels meet the application requirement.\n13.8 GD package vs TL package\nDue to differences in package construction the TL package has a center pad vs no center\npad for the GD package. The following section provides guidance in replacement vs new\napplications.\n•No trace under GD package\n1.Replacement of GD package: The pad is not electrically connected to the silicon\n(no wire bond and epoxy is not conductive) and can be left floating. It is not\nrequired to be connected to the PCB. Simply place the TL package on the same\nPCB traces as the existing GD package.\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

The PCB center pad can be connect to GND or left floating.\n•Trace under the GD package\n1.Replacement of GD package: It is not best practice to have center pad over the\ntrace but since the TL package center pad is not connected to the silicon the risk is\nlow. If there are multiple traces there could be EMI and cross talk. In both cases the\ncustomer needs to evaluate risk.\n2.New use of the TL package: Do not route traces under the package\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

A more in-depth account\nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow\nsoldering description” .\n15.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached\nto Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides\nboth the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method\nthat is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole\nand Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is\nnot suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high\ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n15.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming\nfrom a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the\nfollowing:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless\npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,\nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,\ndue to an increased probability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by\ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,\npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n15.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board\ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are\nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\n15.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.

It is imperative that the peak\ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder\npaste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the\npackages and/or boards are not damaged. The peak temperature of the package\ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in accordance with\nTable 13  and Table 14\nPackage reflow temperature (°C)\nVolume (mm³)Package thickness (mm)\n< 350 ≥ 350\n< 2.5 235 220\n≥ 2.5 220 220Table 13.\u2007SnPb eutectic process (from J-STD-020D)\nPackage reflow temperature (°C)\nVolume (mm³)Package thickness (mm)\n< 350 350 to 2000 > 2000\n< 1.6 260 260 260\n1.6 to 2.5 260 250 245\n> 2.5 250 245 245Table 14.\u2007Lead-free process (from J-STD-020D)\nMoisture sensitivity precautions, as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all\ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small packages reach higher temperatures during reflow\nsoldering, see Figure 16 .\nNTSX2102 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © 2022 NXP B.V.
