The ADM2582E /ADM2587E  include an \nintegrated  isolated dc-to-dc power supply, which eliminates the \nneed for an external dc -to-dc isolation block.  \nThey are  designed for balanced transmissi on lines and compl y \nwith ANSI/ TIA/EIA -485- A-98 and ISO  8482:1987(E).  \nThe device s integrate  Analog Devices, Inc.,  iCoupler ® technology  \nto combine a 3 -channel isolator, a three -state differenti al line driver,  \na differential input receiver , and Analog Devices  isoPower ® dc-to-\ndc converter  into a single package. The device s are powered by a \nsingle 5  V or 3.3  V supply , realizing a fully integrated  signal and \npower  isolated RS -485 solution.  The ADM2582E /ADM2587E  driver ha s an active high enable. \nAn active low receiver enable is also provided , which causes the \nreceiver output to enter a high impedance state when disabled.  \nThe device s have current limiting and thermal shutdown \nfeatures to protect against output short circuits and situations \nwhere bus contention m ay cause excessive power dissipation. \nThe part s are fully specified over the industrial temperature \nrange and are  available in a highly integrated, 20-lead, wide -body  \nSOIC package.  \nThe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  contain isoPower technology that  \nuses high frequency switching elements to transfer  power through  \nthe transformer. Special care must be taken  during printed circuit  \nboard (PCB) layout to meet emissions  standards. Refer to the \nAN-0971 Application Note , Control of Radiated Emissions with \nisoPower  Devices , for details on board layout considerations.  \n \nADM2582E/ ADM2587E Data Sheet\n \nRev.

G | Page 15 of 22 CIRCUIT DESCRIPTION \nSIGNAL ISOLATION  \nThe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  signal isolation is implemented on  \nthe logic side of the interface. The part achieves signal isolation \nby having a digital isolation section and a transceiver section \n(see Figure 1). Data  applied to the T xD and DE pins and referenced  \nto logic ground (GND 1) are coupled across an isolation barrier \nto appear at the transceiver section referenced to isolated ground \n(GND 2). Similarly, the single -ended  receiver output  signal, \nreferenced to isolated ground in the transceiver section, is coupled across the isolation barrier to appear at the RXD pin referenced to logic ground.  \nPOWER ISOLATION  \nThe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  powe r isolation is implemented \nusing an isoPower integrated isolated dc -to-dc converter.  The \ndc-to-dc converter section of the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  works  \non principles that are common to most modern power supplies. It  \nis a secondary side controller architecture with isolated pulse -width  \nmodulation (PWM) feedback. VCC power is supplied to an \noscillating circuit that switches current into a chip -scale air core \ntransformer. Power transferred to the secondary side is rectified and regulated to 3.3 V . Th e secondary (V\nISO) side controller \nregulates the output by creating a PWM control signal that is sent to the primary (V\nCC) side by a dedicated i Coupler data \nchannel. The PWM modulates the oscillator circuit to control \nthe power being sent to the secondary side. Feedback allows for \nsignificantly higher power and efficiency.  \nTRUTH TABLES  \nThe truth tables in this section use the abbreviations found in \nTable 11. \nTable 11.

Shorting the driver outputs to a low impedance \nsource can result in high driver currents. The thermal sensing \ncircuitry detects the increase in die temperature under this \ncondition and disables the driver outputs. This circuitry is designed to disable the driver outputs when a die temperature \nof 150°C is reached. As the device cools, the drivers are reenabled  \nat a temperature of 140°C.  \nOPEN-  AND SHORT -CIRCUIT , FAIL -SAFE RECEIVER \nINPUTS  \nThe receiver inputs have open - and short -circuit , fail-safe \nfeature s that ensure that the receiver output is high when the \ninputs are open or shorted. During line -idle conditions, when no \ndriver on the bus is enabled,  the voltage across a terminating \nresistance at the receiver input decays to 0 V . With t raditional \ntransceivers, receiver input thresholds specified between −200  mV \nand +200 mV mean that external bias resistors are required on the \nA and B pins to ensure  that the receiver outputs are in a known \nstate. The short -circuit , fail-safe receiver inpu t feature eliminates \nthe need for bias resistors by specifying the receiver input threshold  \nbetween − 30 mV and −200 mV . The guaranteed negative threshold  \nmeans that when the voltage between A and B decays to 0  V,  t h e  \nreceiver output is guaranteed to be hig h. \nDC CORRECTNESS AND M AGNETIC FIELD IMMUNI TY \nThe digital signals transmit across the isolation barrier using iCoupler te chnology. This technique uses chip -scale transformer \nwindings to couple the digital signals magnetically from one side of the barrier t o the other. Digital inputs are encoded into \nwaveforms that are capable of exciting the primary transformer winding. At the secondary winding, the induced waveforms are decoded into the binary value that was originally transmitted.  \nPositive and negative lo gic transitions at the isolator input cause \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer.  \nThe decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the  \npulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of logic \ntrans itions at the input for more than 1 µs, periodic sets of refresh  \npulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure dc \ncorrectness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses  \nof more than approximately 5 µ s, the input side is assumed to be \nADM2582E/ ADM2587E Data Sheet  \n \nRev. G | Page 16 of 22 unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case , the isolator output \nis forced to a default state by the watchdog timer circuit.  \nThis situation should occur in the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  \ndevices  only during power -up and power -down operations. The \nlimitation  on the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  magnetic field \nimmunity is set by the condition in which induced voltage in \nthe tran sformer receiving coil is suffi ciently large to either \nfalsely set or reset the decoder. The fol lowing analysis defines \nthe conditions under which this can occur.  \nThe 3.3 V operating condition of the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  \nis examined because it represents the most susceptible mode of \noperation. The pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude  \nof >1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing thres hold of about 0.5 V , \nthus estab lishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltage s can \nbe tolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is \ngiven by  \nV = (− dβ/dt)Σπrn2; n = 1, 2, … , N  \nwhere:  \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss).  \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil.  \nrn is the radius of the nth t urn in the receiving  coil (cm).  \nGiven the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADM2582E / \nADM2587E  and an imposed requirement that the induced \nvoltage be, at most, 50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a \nmaximum allowable magnetic field is calculated as shown in \nFigure 33.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kGauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n08111-019 \nFigure 33. Maximum Allowable External Magnetic Flux Density  For example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a \nvoltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the sensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output transition. \nSimilarly, if such an event occurs during a transmitted pulse (and is of the worst -case polarity), it reduces the received pulse \nfrom >1.0 V to 0.75 V , which is still well above the 0.5 V sensing \nthreshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnetic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  transformers. Figure 34 expresses \nthese allowable current magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. As shown in Figure 34, the ADM2582E / \nADM2587E  are extremely immune and can be affected only by \nextremely large currents operated at high frequency very close to the component. For the 1 MHz example, a 0.5 kA current must be placed 5 mm away from the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  to affect \ncomponent operation.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1k\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n08111-020 \nFigure 34.

G | Page 17 of 22 APPLICATIONS INFORMA TION \nPCB LAYOUT  AND ELECTROMAGNETIC \nINTERFERENCE  (EMI ) \nThe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  isolated RS -422/RS -485 transceiver  \ncontains a n isoPower integrated dc -to-dc converter , requiring \nno external interface circuitry for the logic interfaces. Power \nsupply bypassing is required at the input and output supply pins \n(see Figure 35). The pow er supply section of the ADM2582E / \nADM2587E  uses a 180 MHz oscillator frequency to pass pow er \nefficiently through its chip -scale transformers. In addition, the \nnormal operation of the data section of the iCoupler introduces \nswitching transients on the power supply pins.  \nBypass capacitors are required for several operating frequencies. \nNoise suppression requires a low inductance, high frequency \ncapacitor , whereas  ripple suppression and proper regulation \nrequire a large value capacitor. These capacitors  are connected \nbetween Pin 1 (GND 1) and Pin 2  (V CC) and Pin 8  (V CC) and \nPin 9 (GND 1) for V CC. The VISOIN and V ISOOUT  capacitors are \nconnected between Pin 11 (GND 2) and Pin 12 (V ISOOUT ) and \nPin 19 (V ISOIN) and Pin 20  (GND 2). To suppress noise and reduce  \nripple, a parallel combination of at least two capacitors is required  \nwith the smaller of the two capacitors located closest to the device. \nThe recommended capacitor values are 0.1 µF and 10 µF for \nVISOOUT  at Pin 11 and Pin 12 and V CC at Pin 8 and Pin 9. Capacitor  \nvalues of 0.01 µF and 0.1 µF are recommended for V ISOIN at \nPin 19 and Pin 20 and V CC at Pin 1 and Pin 2. The recommended  \nbest practice is to use a very low inductance ceramic capacitor, or its equivalent, for the smaller value . The total lead length \nbetween both ends of the capacitor and the input power supply pin should not exceed 10 mm.   \nThe dc -to-dc converter section of the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  \ncomponents must  operate , out of necessity, at a very high \nfrequency to allow effic ient power transfer through the small \ntransformers.  This creates high frequency currents that can \npropagate in circuit  board ground and power planes, causing edge \nand dipole radiation.  \nThe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  features an internal split paddle, \nlead frame on the bus side. For the best noise suppression, filter \nboth the GND\n2 pins (Pin 11 and Pin 14) and V ISOOUT  signals of \nthe integrated dc -to-dc converter for high frequency currents. \nUse surface -mount ferrite beads in series with the signals before \nrouting back to the device. See Figure 35 for the recommended \nPCB layout. The impedance of the ferrite bead is chosen to be \nabout 2 kΩ between the 10 0 MHz and 1 GHz frequency range  \nto reduce the emissions at the 180 MHz primary  switching frequency and the 360 MHz secondary side rectifying frequency and harmonics.  \nTo pass the EN55022 radiated emissions standard, the following \nadditional layout guidelines are recommended:  \n• Do not connect the V\nISOOUT  pin to a power plane; \nconnect between V ISOOUT  and V ISOIN using a PCB trace. \nEnsure that V ISOIN (Pin 19) connects  through the L1 \nferrite to V ISOOUT  (Pin 12), as shown in Figure 35. \n• If using a four layer PCB, place an embedded stitching \ncapacitor between GND 1 and GND 2 using internal \nlayers of the PCB planes. An embedded PCB capacitor is created when two metal planes in a PCB overlap each other and are sep arated by dielectric material. \nThis capacitor provides a return path for high \nfrequency common -mode noise currents across the \nisolation gap.  \n• If using a two layer PCB, place a high voltage discrete capacitor that connects  between GND\n1 (Pin 10) and \nGND 2 (Pin  11). This capacitor provides a return path \nfor high frequency common -mode noise currents \nacross the isolation gap.  \n• Ensure that GND 2 (Pin 14) connects  to GND 2 (Pin 11) \non the inside (device side) of the C1 100 nF capacitor.  \n• Ensure that the C 1 capacitor con nects  between V ISOOUT  \n(Pin 12) and GND 2 (Pin 11) on the device side of the \nL1 and L2 ferrites.  \n• Ensure that GND 2 (Pin 16) is connected to GND 2 \n(Pin  11) on the outside (bus side) of the L2 ferrite, as \nshown in Figure 35. \n• Ensure that there is a keep out area for the GND 2 \nplane in the PCB layout around the L1 and L2 ferrites. The keep out area means there must not be a GND\n2 \nfill on any layer below the L1 and  L2 ferrites.  \n• Locate the power delivery circuit in close proximity to \nthe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  device, so that the V CC \ntrace is as short as possible . \nSee the AN-1349  Application Note, PCB Implementation Guidelines \nto Minimize Radiated Emissions on the ADM2582E/ADM2587E RS -\n485/RS -422 Transceivers, for more  information.

Recommended PCB Layout  \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients, ensure \nthat board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. Furthermore, design the board layout such that any coupling that does occur equally affects all pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between \npins exceeding the absolute maximum ratings for the device, \nthereby leading to latch-up and/or permanent damage.  \nThe ADM2582E /ADM2587E  dissipate approximately 650 mW \nof power when fully loaded. Because it is not possible to apply a \nheat sink to an isolation device, the devices primarily depend on heat dissipation into the PCB through the GND pins. If the devices are used at high ambient temperatures, provide a thermal \npath from the GND pins to the PCB ground plane. The board \nlayout in Figure 35 shows enlarged pads for Pin 1, Pin 3, Pin 9, Pin 10, Pin 11, Pin 14, Pin 16, and Pin 20. Implement multiple vias from the pad to the ground plane to reduce the temperature inside the chip significantly. The dimensions of the expanded \npads are at the discretion of the designer and dependent on the \navailable board space. \nINSULATION LIFETIME \nAll insulation structures eventually break down when subjected to \nvoltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of insulation \ndegradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. Analog Devices conducts an extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the insulation structure within the ADM2582E /ADM2587E .  \nAccelerated life testing is performed using voltage levels higher \nthan the rated continuous working voltage. Acceleration factors for \nseveral operating conditions are determined, allowing calculation of the time to failure at the working voltage of interest. The values shown in Table 9 summarize the peak voltages for 50 years of service life in several operating conditions. In many cases, the \nworking voltage approved by agency testing is higher than the \n50-year service life voltage. Operation at working voltages higher than the service life voltage listed leads to premature insulation \nfailure.  \n  The insulation lifetime of the ADM2582E /ADM2587E  depends \non the voltage waveform type imposed across the isolation barrier. \nThe iCoupler insulation structure degrades at different rates, \ndepending on whether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 36, Figure 37, and Figure 38 illustrate these different \nisolation voltage waveforms.  \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. A 50-year \noperating lifetime under the bipolar ac condition determines \nthe Analog Devices recommended maximum working voltage.  \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the insulation \nis significantly lower. This allows operation at higher working voltages while still achieving a 50-year service life. The working \nvoltages listed in Table 9 can be applied while maintaining the \n50-year minimum lifetime, provided the voltage conforms to either the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Any cross insulation voltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 37 or Figure 38 should be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage should be limited to the 50-year lifetime voltage value listed in Table 9. \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n08111-021 \nFigure 36.

G | Page 19 of 22 ISOLATED POWER SUPPLY CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe typical output voltage of the integrated iso Power dc -to-dc \nisolated supply is 3.3 V . The isolated supply in the ADM2587E  is \ncapable of supplying a current of 55 mA when the junction \ntemperature of the device is kept below 120 °C. It is important to \nnote that the current available on the V ISOOUT  pin is the total current  \navailable and includes the current required to supply the internal RS -485 circuitry.  \nThe ADM2587E  can typically supply 15 mA externally on \nV\nISOOUT  when the dri ver is switching at 500 kbps loaded with 54  Ω, \nwhile the junction temperature of the part is less than 120 °C.

Special care must be taken during PCB layout to \nmeet emissions standards.

Up to 256 transceivers can be connected to the RS-485 bus. To minimize reflections, terminate the line at the receiving end in its characteristic impedance and keep stub lengths \noff the main line as short as possible. For half-duplex operation, this \nmeans that both ends of the line must be terminated because either \nend can be the receiving end. \n \nADM2582E/ADM2587ETxD\nA\nBY\nZ\nDE\nRxD\nRE\nISOLATION\nBARRIERTRANSCEIVER\nGND 1\nGND 1GND 2ENCODE\nENCODEENCODE\nDECODEDECODEDECODE D\nROSCILLATOR RECTIFIER\nREGULATORVISOOUTVCC\nVCC\nVISOIN\nMICROCONTROLLER\nAND UART\nRT3.3V/5V POWER\nSUPPLY\n100nF 10µF 100nF 10nF\n100nF 10µF\n100nF 10nF\nDIGITAL ISOLATION iCouplerisoPower DC-TO-DC CONVERTER\n08111-124 \nFigure 40.
