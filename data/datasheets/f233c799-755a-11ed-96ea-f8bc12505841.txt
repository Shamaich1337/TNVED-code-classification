The ADP3331 operates\nwith an input voltage range of 2.6 V to 12 V and delivers a load\ncurrent up to 200 mA. The ADP3331 stands out from the\nconventional LDOs with a novel architecture and an enhanced\nprocess that enables it to offer performance advantages and higher\noutput current than its competition. Its patented design requiresonly a 0.47 mF output capacitor for stability. This device is insensi-\ntive to capacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR), and is stable\nwith any good quality capacitor, including ceramic (MLCC) typesfor space restricted applications. The ADP3331 achieves excep-\ntional accuracy of ±0.7% at room temperature and ±1.4% overall\naccuracy over tempera ture, line, and load variations. The drop-\nout voltage of the ADP3331 is only 140 mV (typical) at 200 mA.This device also includes a safety current limit, thermal over-load protection, and a shutdown feature. In shutdown mode, the\nground current is reduced to less than 2 mA. The ADP3331 has\nultralow quiescent current 34 mA (typical) in light load situations.\nThe SOT-23-6 package has been ther mally enhanced using\nAnalog Device’ s proprietary Chip-on-Lead feature to maxi-\nmize power dissipation.VOUT\nVIN\n+ADP3331\nFBOUTERR\nON\nOFFSD GNDINC2\n0.47/H9262F C1\n0.47/H9262F+EOUTR3 \n330k/H9024\nR1\nR264\nFigure 1.

Output Noise Density\nB\nREV. ADP3331\n–6–THEORY OF OPERATION\nThe ADP3331 anyCAP LDO uses a single control loop for both\nregulation and reference functions, as shown in Figure 2. The\noutput voltage is sensed by an external resistive voltage divider\nconsisting of R1 and R2. Feedback is taken from this networkby way of a series diode (D1) and a second resistor divider (R3\nand R4) to the input of an amplifier.\nPTAT\nVOS gmNONINVERTING\nWIDEBAND\nDRIVERINPUT\nQ1\nADP3331COMPENSATION\nCAPACITORATTENUATION\n(VBANDGAP /VOUT)R1\nD1\nR2R3\nR4OUTPUT\nPTAT\nCURRENTRLOADCLOAD(a)\nGND\nFigure 2. Functional Block Diagram\nA very high gain error amplifier is used to control this loop.\nThe amplifier is constructed in such a way that at equilibrium it\nproduces a large, temperature-proportional input offset voltagethat is repeatable and very well controlled. The temperature-\nproportional offset voltage is combined with the complementary\ndiode voltage to form a virtual band gap voltage, implicit in thenetwork, although it never appears explicitly in the circuit. Ulti-\nmately, this patented design makes it possible to control the loop\nwith only one amplifier. This technique also improves the noisecharacteristics of the amplifier by providing more flexibility onthe trade-off of noise sources, which leads to a low noise design.\nThe R1, R2 divider is chosen in the same ratio as the band gap\nvoltage to output voltage. Although the R1, R2 resistor divider\nis loaded by the diode D1 and a second divider consisting of R3and R4, the values are chosen to produce a temperature stable\noutput. This unique arrangement specifically corrects for the\nloading of the divider so that the error resulting from the basecurrent loading in conventional circuits is avoided.\nThe patented amplifier controls a new and unique noninverting\ndriver that drives the pass transistor, Q1. The use of this special\nnoninverting driver enables the frequency compensation toinclude the load capacitor in a pole-splitting arrangement to\nachieve reduced sensitivity to the value, type, and ESR of the\nload capacitor.\nMost LDOs place strict requirements on the range of ESR values\nfor the output capacitor because they are difficult to stabilize due\nto the uncertainty of the load capacitance and resistance. More-\nover, the ESR value required to keep conventional LDOs stablechanges, depending on load and temperature. These ESR limita-\ntions make designing with LDOs more difficult because of their\nunclear specifications and extreme variations over temperature.\nThe ADP3331 solves this problem. It can be used with any good\nquality capacitor, with no constraint on the minimum ESR. Theinnovative design allows the circuit to be stable with just a small0.47 mF capacitor on the output. Additional advantages of the\npole-splitting scheme include superior line noise rejection and\nvery high regulator gain. The high gain leads to excellent regula-\ntion, and ±1.4% accuracy is guaranteed over line, load, and\ntemperature.\nAdditional features of the circuit include current limit, thermal\nshutdown, and an error flag. Compared to standard solutions that\ngive a warning after the output has lost regulation, the ADP3331provides improved system performance by enabling the ERR pin\nto give a warning just before the device loses regulation.\nAs the chip’ s temperature rises above +165 ∞C, the circuit acti-\nvates a soft thermal shutdown to reduce the current to a safe\nlevel. The thermal shutdown condition is indicated by the ERR\nsignal going low.\nAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nCapacitor Selection\nOutput Capacitor: The stability and transient response of the\nLDO is a function of the output capacitor. The ADP3331 is stable\nwith a wide range of capacitor values, types, and ESR (anyCAP).\nA capacitor as low as 0.47 mF is all that is needed for stability;\nlarger capacitors can be used if high current surges on the output\nare anticipated. The ADP3331 is stable with extremely low ESR\ncapacitors (ESR ª 0), such as multilayer ceramic capacitors\n(MLCC) or OSCON. Note that the effective capacitance of some\ncapacitor types falls below the minimum over temperature or\nwith dc voltage.\nInput Capacitor: An input bypass capacitor is not strictly required\nbut is recommended in any application involving long inputwires or high source impedance. Connecting a 0.47 mF capacitor\nfrom the input to ground reduces the circuit ’s sensitivity to\nPC board layout and input transients. If a larger output capacitoris necessary, a larger value input capacitor is also recommended.\nNoise Reduction Capacitor: A noise reduction capacitor can be\nused to reduce the output noise by 6 dB to 10 dB. This capaci-\ntor limits the noise gain when connected between the feedbackpin (FB) and the output pin (OUT), as shown in Figure 3. Low\nleakage capacitors in the 10 pF to 500 pF range provide the best\nperformance. Since FB is internally connected to a high imped-ance node, any connection to this node should be carefully done\nto avoid noise pickup from external sources. The pad connected\nto this pin should be as small as possible; long PC board tracesare not recommended. When adding a noise reduction capacitor,\nuse the following guidelines:\n∑Maintain a minimum load current of 1 mA when not in\nshutdown.\n∑For CNR values greater than 500 pF, add a 100 k W series\nresistor (RNR).\nIt is important to note that as CNR increases, the turn-on time\nwill be delayed. With CNR values greater than 1 nF, this delay\nmay be on the order of several milliseconds.\nB\nREV.

The output voltage will be divided byR1 and R2, and then fed back to the FB pin.

Under extreme conditions (i.e., high ambient tempera-\nture and power dissipation) where the die temperature starts to\nrise above 165 ∞C, the output current will be reduced until the\ndie temperature has dropped to a safe level.\nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect\nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For normal\noperation, the device ’s power dissipation should be externally\nlimited so that the junction temperature will not exceed 125 ∞C.\nChip-on-Lead\nThe ADP3331 uses a patented Chip-on-Lead package design toensure the best thermal performance in a SOT-23 footprint. In a\nstandard SOT-23, most of the heat flows out of the ground pin.The Chip-on-Lead package uses an electrically isolated die\nattach, which allows all the pins to contribute to heat conduction.\nThis technique reduces the thermal resistance to 190 ∞C/W on a\n2-layer board compared to >230 ∞C/W for a standard SOT-23\nlead frame. Figure 4 shows the difference between the standard\nSOT-23 and the Chip-on-Lead lead frames.\nB\nREV.

This allows the ambient\ntemperature to be significantly higher for a given power dissipa-tion than with a standard package. Assuming a 4-layer board, the\njunction temperature rise above ambient will be approximately\nequal to\n      DTW C W CAJ =¥ =0 257 165 42 4./ .oo(10)\nTo limit the junction temperature to 125 ∞C, the maximum\nallowable ambient temperature is\n      TC C CAMAX() .. =+ - =125 42 4 82 6ooo(11)\nShutdown Mode\nApplying a TTL level high signal to the shutdown ( SD) pin, or\ntying it to the input pin, will turn the output ON. Pulling the\nSD to 0.4 V or below, or tying it to ground, will turn the output\nOFF. In shutdown mode, the quiescent current is reduced to\nless than 1 mA.\nError Flag Dropout Detector\nThe ADP3331 will maintain its output voltage over a widerange of load, input voltage, and temperature conditions. If theoutput is about to lose regulation due to the input voltage\napproaching the dropout level, the error flag will be activated.\nThe ERR output is an open collector, which will be driven low.\nOnce set, the ERR flag’s hysteresis will keep the output low until\na small margin of operating range is restored either by raising\nthe supply voltage or reducing the load.\nLow Voltage Applications\nIn applications where the output voltage is 2.2 V or less, the\nADP3331 may begin to exhibit some turn-on overshoot. Thedegree of overshoot is determined by several factors: the output\nvoltage setting, the output load, the noise reduction capacitor,\nand the output capacitor.\nThe output voltage setting is determined by the application and\ncannot be tailored for minimum overshoot. In general, for output\nvoltages of 2.2 V or less, the overshoot becomes larger as the\noutput voltage decreases.\nThe output load is also determined by the system requirements.\nHowever, if the ADP3331 has no load on the output during\nstartup, a small amount of preload can be added to minimize\novershoot. A preload of 2 mA to 20 mA is recommended.\nA noise reduction capacitor, if not already being used, is sug-gested to reduce the overshoot. Values in the range of 10 pF to\n100 pF work best, along with the preload suggested previously.\nThe output capacitor can be adjusted to minimize the over-\nshoot. Values in the 0.47 mF to 1.0 mF range should be used in\nconjunction with the preload and noise reduction capacitor.\nFurther increases in the output capacitance may be acceptable if\nthe output already has a sizable load during startup.\nHigher Output Current\nThe ADP3331 can source up to 200 mA without any heat sink\nor pass transistor. If higher current is needed, an appropriate pass\ntransistor can be used, as in Figure 5, to increase the outputcurrent to 1 A.\nVIN = 3.3V VOUT = 1.8V @ 1AMJE253*\nC2\n10/H9262FC1\n47/H9262FR1\n50/H9024\n*REQUIRES HEAT SINKIN OUT\nERRGNDSDADP3331\nFB340k/H9024\n698k/H9024\nFigure 5. High Output Current Linear Regulator\nPrinted Circuit Board Layout Considerations\nUse the following general guidelines when designing printed\ncircuit boards:\n1. PC board traces with larger cross sectional areas will remove\nmore heat from the ADP3331. For optimum heat transfer,\nspecify thick copper and use wide traces.\n2. The thermal resistance can be decreased by approximately\n10% by adding a few square centimeters of copper area tothe lands connected to the pins of the LDO.\n3. The feedback pin is a high impedance input, and care should\nbe taken when making a connection to this pin. The voltage\nsetting resistors and noise reduction network must be located\nas close as possible. Long PC board traces are not recom-mended. Avoid routing traces near possible noise sources.\nB\n   ADP3331\n \nRev.
