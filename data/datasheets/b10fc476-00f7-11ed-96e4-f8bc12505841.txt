General description\nThe TJA1021 is the interface between the Local Interconnect Net work (LIN) master/slave \nprotocol controller and the phys ical bus in a LIN. It is primar ily intended for in-vehicle \nsub-networks using baud rates from 1 kBd up to 20 kBd (/20 vari ant) and is compliant with \nLIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2, LIN 2. 2A, SAE J2602 and  ISO 17987-4:201 6 (12 V). The \nTJA1021 is pin-to-pin compatible  with the TJA102 0 and MC33662(B ).\nThe transmit data stream of the protocol controller at the tran smit data input (TXD) is \nconverted by the TJA1021 into a bus signal with optimized slew rate and wave shaping to \nminimize ElectroMagnetic Emission  (EME). The LIN bus output pin  is pulled HIGH via an \ninternal termination resistor. F or a master application, an ext ernal resistor in series with a \ndiode should be connected between pin INH or pin V BAT and pin LIN. The receiver detects \nthe data stream at the LIN bus input pin and transfers it via p in RXD to the microcontroller.\nIn Sleep mode, the power consump tion of the TJA1021 is very low . In failure modes, the \npower consumption is r educed to a minimum.\n2.

Functional description\nThe TJA1021 is the interface bet ween the LIN master/slave proto col controller and the \nphysical bus in a Local Interconnect Network (LIN). The TJA1021  is LIN 2.0, LIN 2.1, \nLIN 2.2, LIN 2.2A, SAE J2602 and ISO 17987-4:2016 (12 V) compliant  and provides \noptimum ElectroMagnetic Compat ibility (EMC) performance due to wave shaping of the \nLIN output.\nThe LIN physical layer is indepen dent of higher OSI model layer s (e.g., the LIN protocol). \nConsequently, nodes containing an ISO 17987-compliant physical layer can be combined, \nwithout restriction, with LIN ph ysical layer nodes that comply with earlier revisions \n(LIN 1.0, LIN 1.1, LIN 1.2, LIN 1.3, LIN 2. 0, LIN 2.1, LIN 2.2 a nd LIN 2.2A).\nThe TJA1021T/20 and TJA1021TK/20 are optimized for the maximum specified LIN \ntransmission speed of 20 kBd; the TJA1021T/10 and TJA1021TK/10 a re optimized for the \nLIN transmission speed of 10.4 kB d as specified by the SAE J2602.\n7.1 Operating modes\nThe TJA1021 supports modes for n ormal operation (Normal mode), power-up (Power-on \nmode) and very-low-power operatio n (Sleep mode). An intermediat e wake-up mode \nbetween Sleep and Normal modes is also supported (Standby mode) . Figure 3  shows the \nstate diagram.\n \n[1] Standby mode is entered automatically upon any local or remo te wake-up event during Sleep mode. Pin INH and the 30 k \uf057 termination \nresistor at pin LIN are switched on.\n[2] The internal wake-up source f lag (set if a local wake-up did  occur and fed to pin TXD) will be reset after a positive edge on pin SLP_N.\n[3] The wake-up interrupt (on pin RXD) is released after a posit ive edge on pin SLP_N.\n[4] Normal mode is entered after a positive edge on SLP_N. As lo ng as TXD is LOW, the transmitter is off. In the event of a sho rt-circuit to \nground on pin TXD, the transmi tter will be disabled.\n[5] Power-on mode is entered after switching on V BAT.Table 4.

Despite  its extreme low \ncurrent consumption, t he TJA1021 can still be woken up remotely  via pin LIN, or woken \nup locally via pin WAKE_N, or activated directly via pin SLP_N.  Filters at the inputs of the \nreceiver (LIN), of pin WAKE_N and of pin SLP_N pre vent unwanted  wake-up events due \nto automotive transients or EMI. All wake-up events must be mai ntained for a certain time \nperiod (t wake(dom)LIN , twake(dom)WAKE_N  and t gotonorm ).\nSleep mode is initiat ed by a falling edge on pin SLP_N in Norma l mode. To enter Sleep \nmode successfully (INH becomes floating), the sleep command (pi n SLP_N = LOW) must \nbe maintained for at least t gotosleep .\nIn Sleep mode the inte rnal slave termination between pins LIN a nd V BAT is disabled to \nminimize the power dissipation in  the event that pin LIN is sho rt-circuited to ground. Only \na weak pull-up between pins LIN and V BAT is present.\nSleep mode can be act ivated independently from the actual level  on pin LIN, pin TXD or \npin WAKE_N. This guarantees tha t the lowest power consumption i s achievable even in \ncase of a continuous d ominant level on pin LIN or a continuous LOW on pin WAKE_N.TERM.: slave termination resi stor, connected between pins LIN a nd V BAT.\nFig 3.

Thes e wake-up events activate pin  INH and enable the \nslave termination resistor at th e pin LIN. As a result of the H IGH condition on pin INH the \nvoltage regulator and the micr ocontroller can be activated.\nStandby mode is signalled by a LOW-level on pin RXD which can b e used as an interrupt \nfor the microcontroller.\nIn Standby mode (pin SLP_N is still LOW), the condition of pin TXD (weak pull-down or \nstrong pull-down) indi cates the wake-up source: weak pull-down for a remote wake-up \nrequest and strong pull-down for a local wake-up request.\nSetting pin SLP_N HIGH during Standby mode results in the follo wing events:\n•An immediate reset of the wake-up source flag; thus releasing t he possible strong \npull-down at pin TXD before th e actual mode change (after t gotonorm ) is performed\n•A change into Normal mode if the HIGH level on pin SLP_N has be en maintained for \na certain time period (t gotonorm )\n•An immediate reset of the wake- up request sign al on pin RXD\n7.4 Normal mode\nIn Normal mode the TJA1021 is able to transmit and receive data  via the LIN bus line. The \nreceiver detects the data stream a t the LIN bus input pin and t ransfers it via pin RXD to \nthe microcontroller (see Figure 1 ): HIGH at a recessive level and LOW at a dominant level \non the bus. The receiv er has a supply-voltage related threshold  with hysteresis and an \nintegrated filter to suppress bus  line noise. The transmit data  stream of the protocol \ncontroller at the TXD input is converted by the transmitter int o a bus signal with optimized \nslew rate and wave shaping to mi nimize EME. The LIN bus output pin is pulled HIGH via \nan internal slave termination re sistor. For a ma ster applicatio n an external resistor in \nseries with a diode should be connected between pin INH or V BAT on one side and pin LIN \non the other side (see Figure 7 ).\nWhen in Sleep, Standby or Power- up mode, the TJA1021 enters Nor mal mode whenever \na HIGH level on pin SLP_N is maintained  for a time of at least tgotonorm .\nThe TJA1021 switches to Sleep mode  in case of a LOW-level on pi n SLP_N, maintained \nfor a time of at least t gotosleep .\n7.5 Wake-up\nWhen V BAT exceeds the power-on-reset threshold voltage V th(POR)H , the TJA1021 enters \nPower-on mode. Though the TJA102 1 is powered-up and INH is HIGH , both the \ntransmitter and receiver are st ill inactive. If SLP_N = 1 for t  > tgotonorm , the TJA1021 enters \nNormal mode.\nThere are three ways to wake-up a  TJA1021 which is in Sleep mod e:\n1.

Local wake-up via a ne gative edge at pin WAKE_N \n3. Mode change (pin SLP_N is HIGH)  from Sleep mode to Normal mod e\n7.6 Remote and local wake-up\nA falling edge at pin LIN followed by a LOW level maintained fo r a certain time period \n(twake(dom)LIN ) and a rising edg e at pin LIN res pectively (see Figure 4 ) results in a remote \nwake-up. It should be noted that the time period t wake(dom)LIN  is measured either in Normal \nmode while TXD is HIGH, or in Sl eep mode irrespective of the st atus of pin TXD.\nA falling edge at pin WAKE_N followed by a LOW level maintained  for a certain time \nperiod (t wake(dom)WAKE_N ) results in a local wake-up. T he pin WAKE_N provides an intern al \npull-up towards pin V BAT. In order to prevent EMI issues, it is recommended to connect an \nunused pin WAKE_N to pin V BAT.\nAfter a local or remote wake-up, pin INH is activated (it goes HIGH) and the internal slave \ntermination resistor is switched  on. The wake-up request is ind icated by a LOW active \nwake-up request signal on pin RX D to interrupt the microcontrol ler.\n7.7 Wake-up via m ode transition\nIt is also possible to set pin INH HIGH with a mode transition towards Normal mode via pin \nSLP_N. This is useful for applications with a continuously powe red microcontroller.\n7.8 Wake-up source recognition\nThe TJA1021 can distin guish between a local wake-up request on pin WAKE_N and a \nremote wake-up request via a dom inant bus state. 'A local wake- up request sets the \nwake-up source flag. The wake-up source can be read on pin TXD in the Standby mode. If \nan external pull-up resistor on p in TXD to the power supply vol tage of the microcontroller \nhas been added, a HIGH level indicates a remote wake-up request  (weak pull-down at pin \nTXD) and a LOW level indicates a local wake-up request (strong pull-down at pin TXD; \nmuch stronger than  the external pu ll-up resistor).\nThe wake-up request flag (signa lled on pin RXD) as well as the wake-up source flag \n(signalled on pin TXD) are reset immediately after the microcon troller sets pin SLP_N \nHIGH.\n7.9 TXD dominant time-out function\nA TXD dominant time-out timer circuit prevents the bus line fro m being driven to a \npermanent dominant state (block ing all network communication) i f pin TXD is forced \npermanently LOW by a hardware and/or software application failu re. The timer is \ntriggered by a negative edge on pin TXD. If the duration of the  LOW-level on pin TXD \nexceeds the inter nal timer value (t to(dom)TXD ), the transmitter is dis abled, driving the bus \nline into a recessive state. The  timer is reset by a positive e dge on pin TXD.\n7.10 Fail-safe features\nPin TXD provides a pull-down to GND in order to force a predefi ned level on input pin TXD \nin case the pin TXD is unsupplied.\nPin SLP_N provides a pull-down to GND in order to force the tra nsceiver into Sleep mode \nin case the pin SL P_N is unsupplied.\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2018.

There are no re verse currents from the bus. Th e LIN transceiver can be \ndisconnected from the power supply  without influencing the LIN bus.\nThe output driver at pin LIN is protected against overtemperatu re conditions. If the \njunction temperature exceeds t he shutdown junction temperature Tj(sd), the thermal \nprotection circuit disables the output driver. The driver is en abled again when the junction \ntemperature has dropped below T j(sd) and a recessive level is present at pin TXD.\nIf VBAT drops below V th(VBATL)L , a protection circuit disables the output driver.

Handling information\nAll input and output pins are pr otected against ElectroStatic D ischarge (ESD) under \nnormal handling. When handling en sure that the appropriate prec autions are taken as \ndescribed in JESD625-A  or equivalent standards.\n16. Soldering of SMD packages\nThis text provides a very brief insight into a complex technolo gy. A more in-depth account \nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow \nsoldering description” .\n16.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most com mon methods through which packa ges are attached to \nPrinted Circuit Boards (PCBs), to  form electrical circuits. The  soldered joint provides both \nthe mechanical and the electrica l connection. There is no singl e soldering method that is \nideal for all IC packages. Wave so ldering is often preferred wh en through-hole and \nSurface Mount Devices (SMDs) ar e mixed on one printed wiring bo ard; however, it is not \nsuitable for fine pitch SMDs. Ref low soldering is  ideal for the  small pitches and high \ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n16.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming from \na standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is  suitable for the following:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered . Packages with solder balls, and some leadless \npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be  wave soldered. Also, \nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm canno t be wave soldered, \ndue to an increased pr obability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process invo lves applying solder paste to a board, followed by \ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Lead ed packages, \npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflo w solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and ref low soldering are:\n•Board specifications, includin g the board fini sh, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n16.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in  wave soldering are:\nTJA1021 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2018.

It is imperat ive that the peak \ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable sold er joints (a solder paste \ncharacteristic). In add ition, the peak tem perature mu st be low enough that the \npackages and/or boards are not d amaged. The peak temperature of  the package \ndepends on package thickness and volume and is classified in ac cordance with \nTable 9  and 10\n \n \nMoisture sensitivity precautions , as indicated on the packing, must be respected at all \ntimes.\nStudies have shown that small pa ckages reach higher temperature s during reflow \nsoldering, see Figure 10 .Table 9.
