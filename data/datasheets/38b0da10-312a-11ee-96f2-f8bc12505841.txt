The output clock frequencies can be modulated to spread energy across a broader range of frequencies, lowering system EMI. The 5P49V5923 implements spread spectrum using the Fractional-N output divide, to  achieve controllable modulation \nrate and spreading magnitude. The Spread spectrum can be applied to any output clock, any clock frequency, and any spread amount from ±0.25% to ±2.5% center spread and -0.5% to -5% down spread.\nTable 2: Loop Filter\nPLL loop bandwidth range depends on the input reference frequency (Fref) and can be set between the loop bandwidth range as shown in the table below.\nTable 3: Configuration Table\nThis table shows the SEL1, SEL0 settings to select the configuration stored in OTP. Four configurations can be stored in OTP. These can be factory programmed or user programmed.\nAt power up time, the SEL0 and SEL1 pins must be tied to \neither the VDDD/VDDA power supp ly so that they ramp with \nthat supply or are tied low (thi s is the same as floating the \npins). This will cause the regist er configuration to be loaded \nthat is selected according to Table 3 above. Providing that OUT0_SEL_I2CB was 1 at POR an d OTP register 0:7=0, after \nthe first 10mS of operation the levels of the SELx pins can be changed, either to low or to the same level as VDDD/VDDA. The SELx pins must be driven with a digital signal of < 300ns Rise/Fall time and only a single pin can be changed at a time. After a pin level change, the device must not be interrupted for at least 1ms so that the new values have time to load and take effect. If OUT0_SEL_I2CB was 0 at POR, alternate configurations \ncan only be loaded via the I2C interface.\nTable 4: Input Clock Select\nInput clock select.

One input \nsupports a crystal between XIN and XOUT. XIN can also be driven from a single ended reference clock. XIN can accept small amplitude signals like from TCXO or one channel of a differential clock.\nThe second clock input (CLKIN, CLKINB) is a fully differential \ninput that only accepts a reference clock. The differential input accepts differential clocks from all the differential logic types and can also be driven from a single ended clock on one of the input pins.\nThe CLKSEL pin selects the in put clock between either \nXTAL/REF or (CLKIN, CLKINB).\nEither clock input can be set as the primary clock. The primary \nclock designation is to establis h which is the main reference \nclock to the PLL. The non-primary clock is designated as the secondary clock in case the primary clock goes absent and a backup is needed. See the previous page for more details about primary versus secondary clock operation.\nThe two external reference clocks can be manually selected \nusing the CLKSEL pin. The SM bi ts must be set to “0x” for \nmanual switchover which is detailed in Manual Switchover Mode section.\nCrystal Input (XIN/REF)\nThe crystal used should be a fundamental mode quartz crystal; overtone crystal s should not be used. \nA crystal manufacturer will calibrate  its crystals to the nominal \nfrequency with a certain load capacitance value. When the oscillator load capacitance matches the crystal load capacitance, the oscillation fr equency will be accurate. When \nthe oscillator load capacitance is  lower than the crystal load \ncapacitance, the oscillation frequency will be higher than \nnominal and vice versa so for an accurate oscillation \nfrequency you need to make sure  to match the oscillator load \ncapacitance with the crystal load capacitance.\nTo set the oscillator load capa citance there are two tuning \ncapacitors in the IC, one at XIN and one at XOUT. They can be adjusted independently but commonly the same value is used for both capacitors. The value of each capacitor is \ncomposed of a fixed capacitance amount plus a variable capacitance amount set with  the XTAL[5:0] register. \nAdjustment of the crystal tuning capacitors allows for maximum flexibility to accommod ate crystals from various \nmanufacturers. The range of tuni ng capacitor values available \nare in accordance with the following table.\nXTAL[5:0] Tuning Capacitor CharacteristicsThe capacitance at each crystal pin inside the chip starts at 9pF with setting 000000b and can be increased up to 25pF with setting 111111b. The step per bit is 0.5pF.\nYou can write the following equation for this capacitance:Ci = 9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0]The PCB where the IC and the crystal will be assembled adds \nsome stray capacitance to each crystal pin and more capacitance can be added to each crystal pin with additional external capacitors.\nYou can write the following equations for the total capacitance \nat each crystal pin:\nC\nXIN = Ci1 + Cs1 + Ce1\nCXOUT  = Ci2 + Cs2 + Ce2\nCi1 and Ci2 are the internal, tunable capacitors. Cs1 and Cs2 \nare stray capacitances at each crystal pin and typical values are between 1pF and 3pF.\nCe\n1 and Ce2 are additional external capacitors that can be \nadded to increase the crystal load capacitance beyond the tuning range of the internal capacitors. However, increasing the load capaci tance reduces the oscillator gain so please \nconsult the factory when adding Ce\n1 and/or Ce2 to avoid \ncrystal startup issues. Ce1 and Ce2 can also be used to adjust \nfor unpredictable stray capacitance in the PCB.\nThe final load capacitance of the crystal:CL = C\nXIN × CXOUT  / (CXIN + CXOUT )\nFor most cases it is reco mmended to set the value for \ncapacitors the same at each crystal pin:\nCXIN = CXOUT  = Cx → CL = Cx / 2\nThe complete formula when the capacitance at both crystal \npins is the same:\nCL = (9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0] + Cs + Ce) / 2\nParameter Bits Step (p F) Min (pF) Max (pF)\nXTAL 6 0.5 9 25\xa0\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 2019 7 PROGRA MMABLE CLOCK GENERATOR5P49V5923   DATASHEET\nExample 1 : The crystal load capacitan ce is specified as 8pF \nand the stray capacitance at each crystal pin is Cs=1.5pF. \nAssuming equal capacitance value at XIN and XOUT, the equation is as follows:\n8pF = (9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0] + 1.5pF) / 2 \n→\n0.5pF × XTAL[5:0] = 5.5pF → XTAL[5:0] = 11 (decimal)\nExample 2 : The crystal load capacitance is specified as 12pF \nand the stray capacitance Cs is unknown. Footprints for external capacitors Ce are added and a worst case Cs of 5pF is used. For now we use Cs + Ce = 5pF and the right value for Ce can be determined later to make 5pF together with Cs.\n12pF = (9pF + 0.5pF × XTAL[5:0] + 5pF) / 2 \n→\nXTAL[5:0] = 20 (decimal)\nManual Switchover Mode\nWhen SM[1:0] is “0 x”, the redundant inputs are in manual \nswitchover mode. In this mode, CLKSEL pin is used to switch \nbetween the primary and secondary clock sources. The primary and secondary clock source setting is determined by the PRIMSRC bit. During the swit chover, no glitches will occur \nat the output of the device, al though there may be frequency \nand phase drift, depending on the exact phase and frequency relationship between the primary and secondary clocks.\n\nPROGRAMMABLE CLOCK GENERA TOR 8 FEBRUARY 21, 20195P49V5923  DATASHEET\nOTP Interface\nThe 5P49V5923 can also store its configuration in an internal \nOTP. The contents of the device's internal programming registers can be saved to the OTP by setting burn_start (W114[3]) to high and can be loaded back to the internal programming registers by setting usr_rd_start(W114[0]) to high.\nTo initiate a save or restore using I\n2C, only two bytes are \ntransferred. The Device Address is issued with the read/write \nbit set to “0”, followed by the appropriate command code. The save or restore instruction executes after the STOP condition is issued by the Master, during which time the 5P49V5923 will not generate Acknowledge bits. The 5P49V5923 will acknowledge the instructions after it has completed execution of them. During that time, the I\n2C bus should be interpreted as \nbusy by all other users of the bus.\nOn power-up of the 5P49V5923,  an automatic restore is \nperformed to load the OTP contents into the internal programming registers. The 5P49V5923 will be ready to \naccept a programming instruction once it acknowledges its 7-bit I\n2C address.\nAvailability of Prim ary and Secondary I2C addresses to allow \nprogramming for multiple devices in a system. The I2C slave \naddress can be changed from the default 0xD4 to 0xD0 by programming the I2C_ADDR bit D0. VersaClock 5 \nProgramming Guide  provides detailed I\n2C programming \nguidelines and register map.\nSD/OE Pin Function\nThe polarity of the SD/OE signal pin can be programmed to be either active HIGH or LOW with the SP bit (W16[1]). When SP \nis “0” (default), the pin becomes active LOW and when SP is “1”, the pin becomes active HIGH. The SD/OE pin can be configured as either to shutdown the PLL or to enable/disable the outputs. The SH bit controls the configuration of the SD/OE pin The SH bit needs to be high for SD/OE pin to be configured as SD\n.\nWhen configured as SD, device is shut down, and the single-ended LVCMOS outputs are driven low. When configured as OE, and outputs are disabled, the outputs are driven high/low.Table 5: SD/OE Pin Fu nction Truth Table\nOutput Alignment\nEach output divider block has a synchronizing POR pulse to \nprovide startup alignment bet ween outputs. This allows \nalignment of outputs for low skew performance. The phase alignment works both for integer output divider values and for fractional output divider values. \nBesides the POR at power up, th e same synchronization reset \nis also triggered when switching between configurations with the SEL0/1 pins. This ensures that the outputs remain aligned in every configuration. This reset causes the outputs to suspend for a few hundred microseconds so the switchover is not glitch-less. The reset can be disabled for applications where glitch-less switch over is required and alignment is not critical.\nWhen using I\n2C to reprogram an output divider during \noperation, alignment can be lost. Alignment can be restored by manually triggering the reset through I\n2C. \nWhen alignment is required for outputs with different \nfrequencies, the outputs are ac tually aligned on the falling \nedges of each output by defau lt. Rising edge alignment can \nalso be achieved by utilizing the programmable skew feature \nto delay the faster clock by 180 degrees. The programmable skew feature also allows for fine tuning of the alignment. \nFor details of register programming, please see VersaClock 5 \nFamily Register Descriptio ns and Programming Guide  for \ndetails.SD/OE InputSP\nSHOEn\nOSn\nGlobal ShutdownOUTnSH bit SP bit OSn bit OEn bit SD/OE OUTn\n0 0 0 x x Tri-state2\n0 0 1 0 x Output active\n0 0 1 1 0 Output active\n0 0 1 1 1 Output driven High Low\n0 1 0 x x Tri-state2\n0 1 1 0 x Output active\n0 1 1 1 0 Output driven High Low0 1 1 1 1 Output active\n1 0 0 x 0 Tri-state\n2\n1 0 1 0 0 Output active\n1 0 1 1 0 Output active\n1 1 0 x 0 Tri-state2\n1 1 1 0 0 Output active\n1 1 1 1 0 Output driven High Low\n1x x x 1 Output driven High Low 1\nNote 1 : Global Shutdown\nNote 2 : Tri-state regardless of OEn bits\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 2019 9 PROGRA MMABLE CLOCK GENERATOR5P49V5923   DATASHEET\nOutput Divides\nEach of the four output divides are comprised of a 12-bit \ninteger counter, and a 24-bit fractional counter. The output divide can operate in integer divide only mode for improved performance, or utilize the fracti onal counters to generate any \nfrequency with a synthesis accuracy better than 50ppb.\nThe Output Divide al so has the capabilit y to apply a spread \nmodulation to the output freq uency. Independent of output \nfrequency, a triangle wave modulation between 30 and 63kHz may be generated.\nOutput Skew\nFor outputs that share a common output divide value, there will be the ability to skew output s by quadrature  values to \nminimize interaction on the PCB. The skew on each output can be adjusted from 0 to 360 degrees. Skew is adjusted in units equal to 1/32 of the VCO period. So, for 100 MHz output and a 2800 MHz VCO, you can select how many 11.161pS units you want added to your skew  (resulting in units of 0.402 \ndegrees). For example, 0, 0.402,  0.804, 1.206, 1.408, and so \non. The granularity of the skew adjustment is always dependent on the VCO period and the output period.\nOutput Drivers\nThe operating voltage ranges of each output is determined by its independent output power pin (V\nDDO) and thus each can \nhave different output voltage leve ls. Output voltage levels of \n1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3V are supported for LVCMOS.\nEach output may be enabled or disabled by register bits. \nWhen disabled an output will be in a logic 0 state as determined by the programming bit table shown on page 6.\nLVCMOS Operation\nOutputs OUT1 & OUT2 each operate the frequency as determined by corresponding programmed Fractional Output Dividers. All the previously described configuration and \ncontrol apply equally to all outputs. Frequency, phase alignment, voltage levels and en able / disable status apply to \nall the OUTx pins. The outputs can be selected to be phase-aligned with each other or inverted relative to one another by register programming bits. Selection of phase-alignment may have negative effects on the phase noise performance of any part of the device due to increased \nsimultaneous switching noise within the device.Device Hardware Configuration\nThe 5P49V5923 supports an internal One-Time Programmable (OTP) memory that can be pre-programmed at the factory with up to 4 complete device configuration. \nThese configurations can be over-written using the serial \ninterface once reset is complete . Any configuration written via \nthe programming interface needs to be re-written after any power cycle or reset. Please contact IDT if a specific factory-programmed configuration is desired.\nDevice Start-up & Reset Behavior\nThe 5P49V5923 has an internal power-up reset (POR) circuit. The POR circuit will remain acti ve for a maximum of 10ms \nafter device power-up.\nUpon internal POR circuit expi ring, the device will exit reset \nand begin self-configuration.\nThe device will load internal registers according to Table 3 .\nOnce the full confi guration has been loaded, the device will \nrespond to accesses on the serial  port and will attempt to lock \nthe PLL to the selected source and begin operation.\nPower Up Ramp Sequence\nVDDA and VDDD must ramp up together. VDDO0~2 must ramp up before, or concurrently with, VDDA and VDDD. All power supply pins must be connected to a power rail even if the output is unused. All power supplies must ramp in a linear fashion and ramp monotonically.\nVDDO0~2\nVDDA\nVDDD\n\nPROGRAMMABLE CLOCK GENERA TOR 10 FEBRUARY 21, 20195P49V5923  DATASHEET\nI2C Mode Operation\nThe device acts as a slave device on the I2C bus using one of \nthe two I2C addresses (0xD0 or 0xD4) to allow multiple \ndevices to be used in the system. The interface accepts byte-oriented block write and block read operations. Two address bytes specify the register address of the byte position of the first register to write or read. Data bytes (registers) are accessed in sequential order from the lowest to the highest byte (most significant bit first). Read and write block transfers can be stopped after any complete byte transfer. During a write operation, data will not be moved into the registers until \nthe STOP bit is received, at wh ich point, all data received in \nthe block write will be wr itten simultaneously.\nFor full electrical I\n2C compliance, it is recommended to use \nexternal pull-up resistors for SDATA and SCLK. The internal pull-down resistors ha ve a size of 100k \uf057 typical.\nI2C Slave Read and Write Cycle SequencingCurrent\xa0Read\nS Dev\xa0Addr\xa0+\xa0R A Data\xa00 A Data\xa01 A A Data\xa0n Abar P\nSequential \xa0Read\nS Dev\xa0Addr\xa0+\xa0W A Data\xa00 A Data\xa01 A A Data\xa0n Abar P Reg\xa0start\xa0Addr A Sr Dev\xa0Addr\xa0+\xa0R A\nSequential \xa0Write\nS Dev\xa0Addr\xa0+\xa0W A Data\xa00 P A Data\xa01 A A Data\xa0n A\nfrom\xa0master\xa0to\xa0slave\nfrom\xa0slave\xa0to\xa0masterReg\xa0start\xa0Addr A\nS\xa0=\xa0start\nSr\xa0=\xa0repeated\xa0start\nA\xa0=\xa0acknowledge\nAbar=\xa0none\xa0acknowledge\nP\xa0=\xa0stop\n\nFEBRUARY 21, 2019 11 PROGR AMMABLE CLOCK GENERATOR5P49V5923   DATASHEET\nTable 6: I2C Bus DC Characteristics\nTable 7: I2C Bus AC Characteristics\nNote 1: A device must internally provide a hold time of at least 300 ns for the SDA signal (referred to the VIH(MIN) of the SCL signal) to bridge \nthe undefined region of the falling edge of SCL.\nNote 2: I2C inputs are 5V tolerant.
