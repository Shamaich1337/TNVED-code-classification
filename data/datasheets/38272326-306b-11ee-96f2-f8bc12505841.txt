The internal feedback resistor R S and R F form a voltage \ndividing circuit to compare the V FB input error amplifier with the reference voltage V REF. The internal \nadjustment tube (PMOS) will control its conduction degree through the gate voltage  provided by \nthe output of the error amplifier, which will make the output voltage V OUT unaffected by the \ntemperature change or input voltage change to a certain extent, so as to maintain the stability of the \ndevice output voltage. \n8.2  Functional Block Diagram\nIN\nOUT\nGNDReferenceParasitic\nDiode\nVREF\nError\nAmplifierRF\nRSVFB\n8.3  Feature Description  \n15 Rev. - 1.0 www.jscj-elec.com  Input Voltage\nIf the input voltage is lower than the nominal output voltage plus the specified dropout voltage, but all \nother conditions are met for normal operation, the device operates in dropout mode. In this condition, the \noutput voltage is the same the \ninput voltage minus the dropout voltage. The transient performance of the \ndevice is significantly degraded because the pass device is in a triode state and no longer controls the \ncurrent through the LDO. Line or load transients in dropout may result in large output voltage deviations.\nIf the input voltage \nis higher than the rated range of the data sheet, the device may cause irreversible \ndamage or failure due to exceeding the maximum rated range of electrical stress. \n8  Detailed Description\n16 Rev. - 1.0 www.jscj-elec.com  8.3  Feature Description(continued)\nReverse Diode\nThe regulator PMOS inside the CJ6385 series contains a parasitic diode that conducts the reverse \ncurrent that may be generat ed \nin the device when the input voltage drops below the output voltage (e.g. \nduring power failure). At this time, \nthe current is conducted from the output end to the input end without \ninternal restriction. If extended reverse voltage operation is anticipated, external limiting is appropriate.\nIntegrated Fault Protection\nThe CJ6385 series has internal current limiting function. During normal operation, the output current of \nthe device will be limited to about 350mA (typical). When the output current exceeds the current limit, the \ndevice will enter an over-current state and the output voltage will be reduced to nearly 0V. When the \nover-current state ends, the device will return to normal output.\nWhen the junction temperature of the device is high, the output voltage of the device will decrease \nlinearly. When the junction  \ntemperature of the device exceeds the rated range of the data sheet, the \ndevice will enter the thermal shutdown mode and the output voltage will be reduced to nearly 0V. When \nthe junction temperature drops to the rated range, the device will release the thermal shutdown state and \nreturn to normal output.\nWhen the output of the device \nis short circuited to the ground, the device will enter the short-circuit \nprotection state. At this time, the \noutput of the device will be reduced to close to 0V, and the output \ncurrent will remain within a certain range.\nDue to the thermal shutdow\nn protection mechanism, when the output current is large, the device may \nenter the thermal shutdown state before entering the over-current state. Therefore, appropriate packaging \nshould be selected to help the device emit more heat, so as to ensure the maximum load current capacity \nof the device.\nAlthough thermal shutdown and short-circuit protection can prevent the possibility of accidental damage \nto devices to a certain extent, \ncontinuous operation of the equipment under junction temperature \nexceeding 125°C will reduce the reliability \nof the equipment. Therefore, the rated maximum operating \ncontact temperature of 125°C shall not be exceeded.\n17 Rev. - 1.0 www.jscj-elec.com  9  Application and Implementation\nVIN VOUT\nGNDCIN\n10μFCOUT\n10μFCJ63859.1  Typical Application Circuit\nVIN VOUT\nGNDCIN\n10μFCOUT\n10μFCJ6385RIN\nFigure 9-1. Fixed Output Regulator(2)Resistance are used at IN\nUsed for circuits that may have \nlarge \nelectrical surges or use large capacitors(1) Conventional Circuit\nUsed for the normal form of circuit\n9.2   Risk Alert and Precautions\nIn some applications, a short duration but high energy spike may occur in the circuit, including peak \nvoltage and surge current. They may cause unstable operation of the regulator, accelerated aging and \npotential hazards, and even damage or \nmalfunction of the regulator. These peaks are usually more likely \nto occur in hot-plug, switch inductance, heavy-load, and other types of circuits.\nIn the practical application of the circuit, place a resistor with appropriate resistance in series before the \nIN of the voltage regulator, \nwhich can help the voltage regulator share part of the energy in case of surge. \nThe resistance value of the resistance should not be too large. The specific resistance value depends on \nthe application of the circuit. Generally, \nthe resistance value of this resistance does not exceed 20Ω. As \nshown in Figure 9-1-(2). \nFor the CJ6385 series, it is \nrecommended that the input voltage should not exceed 25V and the peak  \nvoltage should not exceed 40V. When the \ninput voltage is greater than 25V, or the peak voltage that  \nmay be greater than 40V may appear in the practical circuit, it is recommended to adopt the circuit  \nlayout shown in Figure 9-1-(2) in the circuit design.Instantaneous Electrical Surge \nLarge Output Capacitance\nThe CJ6385 series can obtain better transient response with the help of output capacitance. However, if \nthe output capacitor is relatively large, \nthe surge current generated by the charging of the output capacitor \nwill also be large at the moment of power on of the regulator, and the large surge current passing through \nthe regulator may damage the internal circuit. When the output capacitance is large, adopting the circuit \ndesign shown in Figure 9-1-(2) \nwill reduce the possibility of damage to the device due to large surge \ncurrent to a certain extent. It is recommended that the selection of output capacitor should not exceed \n20μF. If the selection of output capacitor exceeds 20μF, it is recommended to adopt the circuit \ndesign in Figure 9-1-(2) to reduce the possibility of accidental failure of the device due to large \nsurge current during power on.INOUT INOUT\n18 Rev. - 1.0 www.jscj-elec.com  9  Application and Implementation\nFigure 9-2 and Figure 9-3 show the impact of not using R IN [Test circuit is shown in Figure 9-1-(1) ] and \nusing R IN [Test circuit is shown in Figure 9-1-(2) ] on suppressing surge voltage.\nFigure 9-2. Test with The Conventional Circuit \n[Figure 9-1-(1)] 9.2   Risk Alert and Precautions(continued)\nFigure 9-3. Test with the Circuit that 5Ω \nResistance are used at IN [Figure 9-1-(2)] \nAs shown in Figure 9-2., when the input is powered on from 0 to 25V, a very high peak voltage (shown in \nthe red part) is generated in front of the input terminal of the device, and the maximum peak voltage is far \nmore than 25V. When R IN is used, as shown in Figure 9-3., the peak voltage generated by power on is \neffectively suppressed(shown in the green part).\n9.3  Input and Output Capacitor Requirements\nThe CJ6385 series requires a capacitor of 1µf or greater (10µf is recommended for C IN) to be \nconnected between OUT and GND to maintain stability. Ceramic or tantalum capacitors can be used. \nThe larger the capacitance, the better the transient and noise performance. However, when the input \ncapacitance is large, the circuit shown in figure 9-1-(2) may be required. See Large Output Capacitance  \nfor details.\nAlthough stability does not require an input capacitor, when a capacitor of 1µf or greater is \nplaced between in and GND (10µf is recommended for C OUT), it will offset the reactive input source and \nimprove transient and noise performance. If a large fast rise time load transient is expected, a higher \nvalue capacitor is required.\nNOTE\nThe application information in this section is not part of the data sheet component specification, and JSCJ \nmakes no commitment or statement to guarantee its accuracy or completeness. Customers are \nresponsible for determining the rationality of corresponding components in their circuit design and making  \ntests and verifications to ensure the normal realization of their circuit design.\n\n10  Mechanical Information\n10.1  SOT-23-3L Mechanical Information\nSOT-23-3L Outlines Dimensions\nSymbol  Dimensions In Millimeters  Dimensions In Inches  \nMin.

Relevant personnel shall comply with correct  \ninstallation \nand use \nspecifications to avoid ESD  damage to the IC. If appropriate \nmeasures are not taken to prevent ESD damage, the hazards caused by ESD include but \nare not limited \nto degradation of integrated circuit performance or complete  damage of \nintegrated circuit. For some precision integrated circuits, a very small parameter change  \nmay cause the whole device to be inconsistent with its published specifications. \nJunction-to-ambient Thermal Resistance R ΘJA\nDefinition: The junction to ambient thermal resistance R ΘJA is a metric of the thermal performance of the \ndevice's packages. By comparing the metric of different companies on the same product package, the \nthermal performance of the product can be roughly estimated in a relative sense. R ΘJA is measured under \nthe conditions specified in the corresponding specifications. If the measurement of R ΘJA of two  products \nfollows different specifications and standards, or although the same specifications and standards are \nadopted, it \nis not tested in strict accordance with the specifications, then the R ΘJA of two products will lose \nthe meaning of comparison. This product follows the test specified by JEDEC in the EIA/JESD51-x series \ndocuments. R ΘJA \nis measured in still air with T A = 25°C and installed on a 1 in 2 FR-4 board covered with \n2 ounces of copper. \nUsage: Junction to ambient thermal resistance R ΘJA is a parameter defined at the system level rather than \non a single device or chip. In the test of R ΘJA provided in the data sheet, most of the heat generated by \nthe operation of the device is dissipated through the test board rather than the packaging surface of the \ndevice. In fact, the design and layout of PCB (such as chip or pad size, internal package geometry, etc.) \nwill significantly \naffect R ΘJA. At this time, any calculation of the junction temperature or thermal power \nconsumption of the device by applying R ΘJA in the data sheet will have a very large error, so that it does \nnot match the real performance of the device.  \nTherefore, R ΘJA should \nbe used as the relative comparison of product packaging thermal performance \nbetween different companies, rather than directly using R ΘJA in the data sheet in the actual calculation. \nReference Maximum Power Dissipation for Continuous Operation P D Ref\nThe reference maximum power dissipation for continuous operation P D Ref is not an accurate value \nobtained from the actual test. It is a theoretical value obtained according to the heat dissipation capacity \nof packaging combined \nwith practical application. It is used to compare the differences of heat dissipation \ncapacity more intuitively \nbetween products of different companies. This value is only for estimation \nreference and cannot be used as an index\n of the actual performance of the device for circuit design.\n23 Rev. - 1.0 www.jscj-elec.com  \n11  Notes and Revision History\n11.3  Revision History\nJune, 2022: updated CJ6385 series rev - 1.0.\n24 Rev. - 1.0 www.jscj-elec.com  \nCopyright © JIANGSU CHANGJING ELECTRONICS TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD.DISCLAIMER\nIMPORTANT NOTICE, PLEASE READ CAREFULLY\nThe information in this data sheet is intended to describe the operation and characteristics of our products. \nJSCJ has the right to make any modification, enhancement, improvement, correction or other changes to any \ncontent in this data sheet, including but not limited to specification parameters, circuit design and application \ninformation, without prior notice.  \nAny person who purchases or uses JSCJ products for design shall: 1.
