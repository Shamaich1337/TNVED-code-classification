The parts operate from a single 2.35 V  to 3.6 V power supply and feature throughput rates of up to  3 MSPS. The parts contain a low noise, wide bandwidth track-\nand-hold amplifier that can handle input frequencies in excess \nof 55 MHz. \nThe conversion process and data acquisition are controlled \nusing CS\n and the serial clock, allowing the devices to interface \nwith microprocessors or DSPs. The input signal is sampled on the falling edge of CS\n, and the conversion is initiated at this \npoint. There are no pipeline de lays associated with the part. \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 use advanced design techniques \nto achieve very low power dissipat ion at high throughput rates. \nThe reference for the part is ta ken internally from VDD. This \nallows the widest dynamic input range to the ADC; therefore, the analog input range for the part is 0 to VDD. The conversion rate is determined by the SCLK.

E | Page 10 of 28 TIMING EXAMPLES \nFor the AD7276 , if CS is brought high during the 14th SCLK rising \nedge after the two leading zeros and 12 bits of the conversion \nhave been provided, the part ca n achieve the fastest throughput \nrate, 3 MSPS. If CS is brought high during the 16th SCLK rising \nedge after the two leading zeros and 12 bits of the conversion and two trailing zeros have been provided, a throughput rate of 2.97 MSPS is achievable. This is illustrated in the following two timing examples. \nTiming Example 1 \nIn Figure 6, using a 14 SCLK cycle, f SCLK = 48 MHz and the \nthroughput is 3 MSPS. This produces a cycle time of t 2 + \n12.5(1/f SCLK) + t ACQ = 333 ns, where t 2 = 6 ns minimum and \ntACQ = 67 ns. This satisfies the requ irement of 60 ns for t ACQ. Figure 6 also \nshows that t ACQ comprises 0.5(1/f SCLK) + t 8 + t QUIET , where  \nt8 = 14 ns max. This allows a value of 43 ns for t QUIET , satisfying \nthe minimum requirement of 4 ns. \nTiming Example 2 \nThe example in Figure 7 uses a 16 SCLK cycle, f SCLK = 48 MHz, \nand the throughput is 2.97 MSPS. This produces a cycle time of \nt2 + 12.5(1/f SCLK) + t ACQ = 336 ns, where t 2 = 6 ns minimum and \ntACQ = 70 ns. Figure 7 shows that t ACQ comprises 2.5(1/f SCLK) + t 8 + \ntQUIET, where t 8 = 14 ns max. This satisfies the minimum \nrequirement of 4 ns for t QUIET.  \n04903-005123 4 5 1 3 1 4 1 5 1 6 SCLK\nSDATA\nTHREE-STATE THREE-\nSTATE 2 LEADING\nZEROS2 TRAILING\nZEROSBCS\nt3tCONVERT\nt2\nZEROZ DB11 DB10 DB9 DB1 DB0 ZERO ZEROt6\nt5 t8t1\ntQUIET\n1/THROUGHPUTt4t7\n \nFigure 5.

E | Page 15 of 28 TERMINOLOGY \nIntegral Nonlinearity \nThe maximum deviation from a straight line passing through the endpoints of the ADC transfer function. For the AD7276/ \nAD7277/ AD7278 , the endpoints of the transfer function are \nzero scale at 0.5 LSB below the first code transition and full scale at 0.5 LSB above the last code transition. \nDifferential Nonlinearity \nThe difference between the measured and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes in the ADC. \nOffset Error \nThe deviation of the first code transition (00 . . . 000) to  \n(00 . . . 001) from the ideal, that is, AGND + 0.5 LSB. \nGain Error \nThe deviation of the last code transition (111 . . . 110) to  \n(111 . . . 111) from the ideal after adjusting for the offset error, \nthat is, V\nREF − 1.5 LSB. \nTotal Unadjusted Error \nA comprehensive specification that includes gain, linearity, and \noffset errors. \nTrack-and-Hold Acquisition Time \nThe time required after the conversion for the output of the track-and-hold amplifier to reach its final value within ±0.5 LSB. See the Serial Interface section for more details. \nSignal-to-Noise + Distortion Ratio (SINAD)  \nThe measured ratio of signal to  noise plus distortion at the \noutput of the ADC. The signal is the rms amplitude of the fundamental, and noise is the rms sum of all nonfundamental signals up to half the sampling frequency (f\nS/2), including \nharmonics but excluding dc. The ratio is dependent on the number of quantization levels in the digitization process: the more levels, the smaller the quantization noise. For an ideal  \nN-bit converter, the SINAD is defined as \ndB 76 . 1 02 . 6\uf02b \uf03dN SINAD  \nAccording to this equation, the SINAD is 74 dB for a 12-bit \nconverter and 62 dB for a 10-bit converter. However, various \nerror sources in the ADC, including integral and differential \nnonlinearities and internal ac noise sources, cause the \nmeasured SINAD to be less than its theoretical value. \n Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) \nThe ratio of the rms sum of harmon ics to the fundamental. It is \ndefined as: \n\uf028\uf029\n12\n62\n52\n42\n32\n2log 20 dBVV V V V V\nTHD\uf02b \uf02b \uf02b \uf02b\n\uf03d  \nwhere: \nV1 is the rms amplitude of the fundamental. \nV2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second \nthrough sixth harmonics. \nPeak Harmonic or Spurious Noise \nThe ratio of the rms value of th e next largest component in the \nADC output spectrum (up to f S/2, excluding dc) to the rms value \nof the fundamental. Normally, the value of this specification is \ndetermined by the largest harmonic in the spectrum; however, \nfor ADCs with harmonics buried in the noise floor, it is determined by a noise peak. \nIntermodulation Distortion \nWith inputs consisting of sine waves at two frequencies, fa and \nfb, any active device with nonlinearities creates distortion \nproducts at sum and difference frequencies of mfa ± nfb, where m and n = 0, 1, 2, 3, …. Intermodulation distortion terms are those for which neither m nor n are equal to zero. For example, the second-order terms include (fa + fb) and (fa − fb), and the \nthird-order terms include (2fa + fb), (2fa − fb), (fa + 2fb), and (fa − 2fb).  \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 are tested using the CCIF \nstandard in which two input frequencies are used (see fa and fb \nin the specifications). In this case, the second-order terms are \nusually distanced in frequency from the original sine waves, and the third-order terms are usually at a frequency close to the \ninput frequencies. As a result, the second- and third-order \nterms are specified separately. The intermodulation distortion \nis calculated in a similar manner to the THD specification, that is, the ratio of the rms sum of th e individual distortion products \nto the rms amplitude of the sum of the fundamentals expressed \nin decibels. \nAperture Delay \nThe measured interval between the leading edge of the sampling clock and the point at whic h the ADC takes the sample. \nAperture Jitter \nThe sample-to-sample variation when the sample is taken. \nAD7276/AD7277/AD7278 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 16 of 28 THEORY OF OPERATION \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 are fast, micropower, 12-/10-/ \n8-bit, single-supply ADCs, respectively. The parts can be operated \nfrom a 2.35 V to 3.6 V supply. When operated from a supply voltage within this range, the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 are \ncapable of throughput rates of 3 MSPS when provided with a  48 MHz clock.  \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 provide the user with an on-\nchip track-and-hold ADC and a serial interface housed in a tiny \n6-lead TSOT or an 8-lead MSOP package, which offers the user \nconsiderable space-saving advantag es over alternative solutions. \nThe serial clock input accesses da ta from the part and provides \nthe clock source for the succe ssive approximation ADC. The \nanalog input range is 0 V to V\nDD. An external reference is not \nrequired for the ADC, and there is no reference on-chip. The reference for the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 is derived from the \npower supply, resulting in the widest dynamic input range. \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 also feature a power-down \noption to save power between conversions. The power-down feature is implemented across the standard serial interface as \ndescribed in the Modes of Operation section. \nCONVERTER OPERATION \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 are successive approximation \nADCs that are based on a charge redistribution DAC. Figure 19 \nand Figure 20 show simplified schematics of the ADC. Figure 19 shows the ADC during its acquisit ion phase, where SW2 is closed, \nSW1 is in Position A, the comparator is held in a balanced con-dition, and the sampling capacitor acquires the signal on V\nIN. 04903-019COMPARATORACQUISITION\nPHASE\nVDD/2SW2VINSAMPLING\nCAPACITOR\nAGNDA\nSW1\nBCHARGE\nREDISTRIBUTION\nDAC\nCONTROL\nLOGIC\n \nFigure 19.

Th e control logic and the charge \nredistribution DACs are used to add and subtract fixed \namounts of charge from the sa mpling capacitor to bring the \ncomparator back into a bala nced condition.

AD7276 /AD7277 /AD7278  Transfer Characteristics \nTYPICAL CONNECTION DIAGRAM \nFigure 22 shows a typical connection diagram for the AD7276 / \nAD7277/ AD7278 . V REF is taken internally from V DD; therefore, \nVDD should be decoupled. This provides an analog input range \nof 0 V to V DD. The conversion result is output in a 16-bit word \nwith two leading zeros followed by the 12-bit, 10-bit, or 8-bit \nresult. The 12-bit result from the AD7276 is followed by two \ntrailing zeros; the 10-bit and 8-bit results from the AD7277 and \nAD7278 are followed by four and six trailing zeros, respectively. \nAlternatively, because the supp ly current required by the AD7276/ \nAD7277/ AD7278  is so low, a precision reference can be used as \nthe supply source for the AD7276 /AD7277 /AD7278. A REF192 \nor REF193 voltage reference ( REF193 for 3 V) can be used to \nsupply the required voltage to the ADC (see Figure 22). This \nconfiguration is especially useful  if the power supply is noisy or \nthe system supply voltage is a value other than 3 V (for example, 5 V or 15 V). The REF192 or REF193 outputs a steady \nvoltage to the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278. If the low dropout \nREF193 is used, it must supply a current of typically 1 mA to the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278. When the ADC is converting at \na rate of 3 MSPS, the REF193 must supply a maximum of 5 mA \nto the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 .  \nData Sheet  AD7276/AD7277/AD7278\n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 28 The load regulation of the REF193 is typically 10 ppm/mA \n(REF193 , V S = 5 V), which results in an error of 50 ppm (150 μV) \nfor the 5 mA drawn from it. When V DD = 3 V from the REF193, \nit corresponds to an error of 0.204 LSB, 0.051 LSB, and 0.0128 LSB \nfor the AD7276 , AD7277, and AD7278, respectively. For \napplications where power consum ption is of concern, use the \npower-down mode of the ADC and the sleep mode of the \nREF193 reference to improve power performance.

The two diodes, D1 \nand D2, provide ESD protection for the analog inputs. Care must be taken to ensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the supply rails by more than 300 mV. Signals exceeding this \nvalue cause these diodes to become forward biased and to start \nconducting current into the substrate. These diodes can conduct a maximum current of 10 mA without causing irreversible damage to the part. Capacitor C1 in Figure 23 is typically about \n4 pF and can primarily be attribu ted to pin capacitance. Resistor \nR1 is a lumped component made up of the on resistance of a switch. This resistor is typically about 75 Ω. Capacitor C2 is the ADC sampling capacitor and has a capacitance of 4 pF typically \nwhen in hold mode and 32 pF typically when in track mode. \nFor ac applications, removing high frequency components from the analog input signal is  recommended by using a band-\npass filter on the relevant anal og input pin. In applications \nwhere the harmonic distortion and signal-to-noise ratio are critical, the analog input should be driven from a low impedance source.  Large source impedances significantly affect the ac performance of these ADCs and can necessitate the use of an input buffer amplifier. The AD8021 op amp is compatible with these devices; \nhowever, the choice of the op amp is a function of the \nparticular application.  \n04903-023C1\n4pFC2R1\nCONVERSION PHASE—SWITCH OPEN\nTRACK PHASE—SWITCH CLOSEDD1\nD2VDD\nVIN\n \nFigure 23. Equivalent Analog Input Circuit \nWhen no amplifier is used to drive the analog input, the source \nimpedance should be limited to a low value. The maximum source impedance depends on th e amount of THD that can be \ntolerated. The THD increases as the source impedance increases and performance degrades. Figure 16 shows a graph of the THD \nvs. the analog input frequency for different source impedances \nwhen using a supply voltage of 3 V and sampling at a rate of 3 MSPS. \nDigital Inputs \nThe digital inputs applied to the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 are \nnot limited by the maximum ratings that limit the analog inputs. Instead, the digital inputs applied to the AD7276/ AD7277 / \nAD7278 can be 6 V and are not restricted by the V\nDD + 0.3 V \nlimit of the analog inputs. For example, if the AD7276 /AD7277 / \nAD7278 are operated with a V DD of 3 V, then 5 V logic levels \ncan be used on the digital inputs. However, it is important to \nnote that the data output on SDATA still has 3 V logic levels \nwhen V DD = 3 V. Another advantage of SCLK and CS not being \nrestricted by the V DD + 0.3 V limit is that power supply sequencing \nissues are avoided. For example, unlike with the analog inputs, with the digital inputs, if \nCS or SCLK is applied before V DD, \nthere is no risk of latch-up. \nAD7276/AD7277/AD7278 Data Sheet\n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 28 MODES OF OPERATION \nThe mode of operation of the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 is \nselected by controlling the logic state of the CS signal during a \nconversion. There are three possible modes of operation: normal \nmode, partial power-down mode, and full power-down mode. The point at which \nCS is pulled high after the conversion has \nbeen initiated determines which power-down mode, if any, the device enters. Similarly, if the device is already in power-down \nmode, \nCS can control whether the device returns to normal \noperation or remains in power-down mode. These modes of \noperation are designed to provide flexible power management options, which can be chosen to optimize the power dissipation/ throughput rate ratio for different application requirements. \nNormal Mode \nThis mode is intended for fast est throughput rate performance \nbecause the device remains fully powered at all times, eliminating worry about power-up times. Figure 24 shows the general diagram of AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 operation in this mode.  \nThe conversion is initiated on the falling edge of \nCS as described \nin the Serial Interface section. To ensure that the part remains \nfully powered up at all times, CS must remain low until at least \n10 SCLK falling edges elapse after the falling edge of CS. If CS is \nbrought high after the 10th SCLK falling edge but before the 16th \nSCLK falling edge, the part remains powered up, but the con-version is terminated and SDATA goes back into three-state. \nFor the AD7276 , a minimum of 14 serial clock cycles are \nrequired to complete the conversion and access the complete \nconversion result. For the AD7277 and AD7278, a minimum of \n12 and 10 serial clock cycles are required to complete the \nconversion and to access the complete conversion result, respectively. CS can idle high until the next conversion or low until CS returns \nhigh before the next conversion (effectively idling CS low). \nOnce a data transfer is complete (SDATA has returned to \nthree-state), another conversion can be initiated after the quiet \ntime, t QUIET , has elapsed by bringing CS low again. \nPartial Power-Down Mode \nThis mode is intended for use in applications where slower \nthroughput rates are required. An example of this is when \neither the ADC is powered down between each conversion or a series of conversions is performed at a high throughput rate \nand then the ADC is powered down for a relatively long duration \nbetween these bursts of several conversions. When the AD7276 / \nAD7277/ AD7278  are in partial power-down mode, all analog \ncircuitry is powered down except the bias-generation circuit. \nTo enter partial power-down mode, interrupt the conversion \nprocess by bringing \nCS high between the second and 10th falling \nedges of SCLK, as shown in Figure 25.  \nOnce CS is brought high in this window of SCLKs, the part \nenters partial power-down mode, the conversion that was \ninitiated by the falling edge of CS is terminated, and SDATA \ngoes back into three-state. If CS is brought high before the \nsecond SCLK falling edge, the part remains in normal mode and does not power down. This prevents accidental power-down due \nto glitches on the \nCS line. \n \n  \nCS\nSCLK11 0 1 2 1 4 1 6AD7276/\nAD7677/AD7278\nSDATA VALID DATA\n04903-024 \nFigure 24.

E | Page 19 of 28 To exit this mode of operation and power up the AD7276 / \nAD7277/ AD7278 , users should perform a dummy conversion. \nOn the falling edge of CS, the device begins to power up and \ncontinues to power up as long as CS is held low until after the \nfalling edge of the 10th SCLK. The device is fully powered up \nonce 16 SCLKs elapse; valid data results from the next \nconversion, as shown in Figure 26. If CS is brought high before \nthe 10th falling edge of SCLK, the AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 go \ninto full power-down mode. Ther efore, although the device can \nbegin to power up on the falling edge of CS, it powers down on \nthe rising edge of CS as long as this occurs before the 10th SCLK \nfalling edge. \nIf the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278  are already in partial power-\ndown mode and CS is brought high before the 10th falling edge \nof SCLK, the device enters full power-down mode. For more \ninformation on the power-up ti mes associated with partial \npower-down mode in various configurations, see the Power-Up \nTimes section. \nFull Power-Down Mode \nThis mode is intended for use in applications where throughput rates slower than those in th e partial power-down mode are \nrequired because power-up from a full power-down takes substantially longer than that from a partial power-down. This \nmode is suited to applications where a series of conversions performed at a relatively high throughput rate are followed by a long period of inactivity and thus, power down. \nWhen the AD7276/ AD7277 /AD7278 are in full power-down \nmode, all analog circuitry is powered down. To enter full power-\ndown mode, put the device into partial power-down mode by bringing CS\n high between the second and 10th falling edges of \nSCLK. In the next conversion cy cle, interrupt the conversion \nprocess in the same way as shown in Figure 27 by bringing CS \nhigh before the 10th SCLK falling edge. Once CS is brought high \nin this window of SCLKs, the part powers down completely. Note that it is not necessary to complete the 16 SCLKs once CS\n \nis brought high to enter either of the power-down modes. \nGlitch protection is not available when entering full power-down \nmode. \nTo exit full power-down mode and to power up the AD7276/ \nAD7277/ AD7278 , users should perform a dummy conversion, \nsimilar to when powering up from partial power-down mode. \nOn the falling edge of CS, the device begins to power up and \ncontinues to power up as long as CS is held low until after the \nfalling edge of the 10th SCLK. The required power-up time must \nelapse before a conversion can be initiated, as shown in Figure 28. \nSee the Power-Up Times section for the power-up times associated with the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278. Power-Up Times \nThe AD7276 /AD7277/ AD7278 have two power-down modes, \npartial power-down and full power-down, which are described \nin detail in the Modes of Operation section. This section deals \nwith the power-up time required when coming out of either of these modes.  \nTo power up from partial power-down mode, one cycle is \nrequired. Therefore, with an SCLK frequency of up to 48 MHz, one dummy cycle is sufficient to allow the device to power up from partial power-down mode. Once the dummy cycle is \ncomplete, the ADC is fully powere d up and the input signal is \nacquired properly. The quiet time, t\nQUIET , must still be allowed \nfrom the point where the bus goes back into three-state after \nthe dummy conversion to the next falling edge of CS. \nTo power up from full power-down, approximately 1 μs should be allowed from the falling edge of \nCS, shown in Figure 28 as \ntPOWER UP . \nNote that during power-up from partial power-down mode, the track-and-hold, which is in hold mode while the part is powered \ndown, returns to track mode after  the first SCLK edge, following \nthe falling edge of CS\n. This is shown as Point A in Figure 26. \nWhen power supplies are first applied to the AD7276/ AD7277/ \nAD7278, the ADC can power up in either of the power-down modes or in normal mode. Because of this, it is best to allow a dummy cycle to elapse to ensure that the part is fully powered \nup before attempting a valid conversion. Likewise, if the part is \nto be kept in partial power-down mode immediately after the supplies are applied, then two dummy cycles must be initiated. The first dummy cycle must hold \nCS low until after the 10th \nSCLK falling edge; in the second cycle, CS must be brought \nhigh between the second and 10th SCLK falling edges (see \nFigure 25).  \nAlternatively, if the part is to be placed into full power-down \nmode when the supplies are applied, three dummy cycles must \nbe initiated. The first dummy cycle must hold CS low until after \nthe 10th SCLK falling edge; the second and third dummy cycles \nplace the part into full power-down mode (see Figure 27).

THROUGHPUT RATE \nFigure 29 shows the power consumption of the device in \nnormal mode, in which the part is never powered down. By using the power-down mode of the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 \nwhen not performing a conversion, the average power consump-\ntion of the ADC decreases as the throughput rate decreases. \nFigure 30 shows that as the throughput rate is reduced, the device remains in its power-down state longer, and the average power consumption over time drops accordingly. For example, if the AD7276/ AD7277 /AD7278  are operated in continuous \nsampling mode with a throughput rate of 200 kSPS and an \nSCLK of 48 MHz (V\nDD = 3 V) and the devices are placed into \npower-down mode between conversions, then the power \nconsumption is calculated as follows. The power dissipation \nduring normal operation is 12.6 mW (V DD = 3 V). If the power-\nup time is one dummy cycle, that is, 333 ns, and the remaining \nconversion time is 290 ns, then the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 \ncan be said to dissipate 12. 6 mW for 623 ns during each \nconversion cycle. If the throughput rate is 200 kSPS, then the \ncycle time is 5 μs and the average power dissipated during each cycle is 623/5,000 × 12.6 mW = 1.56 mW. Figure 29 shows the \npower vs. throughput rate when using the partial power-down \nmode between conversions at 3 V. The power-down mode is intended for use with  throughput rates of less than 600 kSPS, \nbecause at higher sampling rates, there is no power saving achieved by using the power-down mode. \n04903-029\nTHROUGHPUT (kSPS)POWER (mW)\n03.07.4\n20007.2\n7.0\n6.8\n6.6\n6.4\n6.2\n6.0\n5.8\n5.6\n5.4\n5.2\n5.0\n4.8\n4.6\n4.4\n4.2\n4.0\n3.8\n3.6\n3.4\n3.2\n200 400 600 800 1000 1200 1400 1600 1800VARIABLE\nSCLK50MHz SCLK\n \nFigure 29.

E | Page 22 of 28 SERIAL INTERFACE \nFigure 31 through Figure 34 show the detailed timing diagrams \nfor serial interfacing to the AD7276, AD7277, and AD7278. \nThe serial clock provides the conversion clock and controls the \ntransfer of information from the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 \nduring conversion. \nThe CS signal initiates the data tran sfer and conversion process. \nThe falling edge of CS puts the track-and-hold into hold mode \nand takes the bus out of three-state. The analog input is \nsampled and the conversion is initiated at this point. \nFor the AD7276, the conversion requires completing 14 SCLK \ncycles. Once 13 SCLK falling edges have elapsed, the track-and-\nhold goes back into track mode on the next SCLK rising edge, as shown in Figure 31 at Point B. If the rising edge of CS\n occurs \nbefore 14 SCLKs have elapsed, the conversion is terminated \nand the SDATA line goes back in to three-state. If 16 SCLKs are \nconsidered in the cycle, the last two bits are zeros and SDATA \nreturns to three-state on the 16th SCLK falling edge, as shown in \nFigure 32. \nFor the AD7277, the conversion requires completing 12 SCLK \ncycles. Once 11 SCLK falling ed ges elapse, the track-and-hold \ngoes back into track mode on the next SCLK rising edge, as \nshown in Figure 33 at Point B. If the rising edge of CS occurs \nbefore 12 SCLKs elapse, the conversion is terminated and the \nSDATA line goes back into three-state. If 16 SCLKs are \nconsidered in the cycle, the AD7277 clocks out four trailing \nzeros for the last four bits and SDATA returns to three-state on \nthe 16th SCLK falling edge, as shown in Figure 33. \nFor the AD7278, the conversion requires completing 10 SCLK \ncycles. Once 9 SCLK falling ed ges elapse, the track-and-hold \ngoes back into track mode on the next rising edge. If the rising \nedge of CS occurs before 10 SCLKs elapse, the part enters power-\ndown mode. If 16 SCLKs are considered in the cycle, then the AD7278 clocks \nout six trailing zeros for the last six bits and SDATA returns to three-state on the 16\nth SCLK falling edge, as shown in Figure 34. \nIf the user considers a 14 SCLK cycle serial interface for the AD7276/ AD7277 /AD7278, then CS\n must be brought high after \nthe 14th SCLK falling edge. Then the last two trailing zeros are \nignored, and SDATA goes back into three-state. In this case, the 3 MSPS throughput can be  achieved by using a 48 MHz \nclock frequency. \nCS\n going low clocks out the first leading zero to be read by the \nmicrocontroller or DSP. The remaining data is then clocked out \nby subsequent SCLK falling edges, beginning with the second \nleading zero. Therefore, the first falling clock edge on the serial \nclock provides the first leading zero and clocks out the second leading zero. The final bit in the data transfer is valid on the 16\nth \nfalling edge, because it is clocked out on the previous (15th) \nfalling edge. \nIn applications with a slower SCLK , it is possible to read data \non each SCLK rising edge. In such  cases, the first falling edge of \nSCLK clocks out the second leading zero and can be read on the \nfirst rising edge. However, th e first leading zero clocked out \nwhen CS goes low is missed if read within the first falling edge. \nThe 15th falling edge of SCLK clocks out the last bit and can be \nread on the 15th rising SCLK edge. \nIf CS goes low just after one SCLK falling edge elapses, then CS \nclocks out the first leading zero and can be read on the SCLK rising edge. The next SCLK falling edge clocks out the second leading zero and can be read on the following rising edge. \n \n04903-099tQUIETtCONVERT\n1/THROUGHPUTCS\n15 13\nt4234\nt5 t3t2 t6\nt7 t914Bt1\nSCLK\nSDATATHREE-STATE THREE-\nSTATE 2 LEADING\nZEROSZZ E R O DB11 DB10 DB9 DB1 DB0\n \nFigure 31.

E | Page 24 of 28 AD7278 IN A 10 SCLK CYCLE SERIAL INTERFACE \nFor the AD7278, if CS is brought high during the 10th rising \nedge after the two leading zeros and eight bits of the conversion \nare provided, then the part can achieve a 4 MSPS throughput rate. For the AD7278, the track-and-hold go es back into track \nmode on the ninth rising edge. In this case, a f\nSCLK = 48 MHz and \nthroughput of 4 MSPS result in a cycle time of t 2 + 8.5(1/f SCLK) + \ntACQ = 250 ns, where t 2 = 6 ns minimum and t ACQ = 67 ns. This \nsatisfies the requirement of 60 ns for t ACQ. Figure 35 shows that \ntACQ comprises 0.5(1/f SCLK) + t 8 + t QUIET , where t 8 = 14 ns max. \nThis allows a value of 43 ns for t QUIET , satisfying the minimum \nrequirement of 4 ns. \nMICROPROCESSOR INTERFACING \nAD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 to Blackfin Processor \nThe Analog Devices, Inc., family  of Blackfin DSPs, including \nthe ADSP-BF531 , ADSP-BF532 , ADSP-BF533, ADSP-BF534, \nADSP-BF535, ADSP-BF536, ADSP-BF537, ADSP-BF538, \nADSP-BF538F, ADSP-BF539, and ADSP-BF539F , interfaces \ndirectly to the AD7276/ AD7277 /AD7278 without requiring \nglue logic.

E | Page 25 of 28 APPLICATION HINTS \nGROUNDING AND LAYOUT \nThe printed circuit board that houses the AD7276/ AD7277 / \nAD7278 should be designed so that the analog and digital \nsections are separated and conf ined to certain areas of the \nboard. This design facilitates  using ground planes that can \neasily be separated. \nTo provide optimum shielding for ground planes, a minimum \netch technique is generally best. All AGND pins of the AD7276 / \nAD7277/ AD7278  should be sunk into the AGND plane. Digital \nand analog ground planes should be joined in one place only. If \nthe AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 are in a system where multiple \ndevices require an AGND-to-DGND connection, the connection should still be made at only one point, a star ground point \nestablished as close as possible to the ground pin on the AD7276/ AD7277 /AD7278. \nAvoid running digital lines under the device because this couples noise onto the die. However, the analog ground plane should be allowed to run under the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 \nto avoid noise coupling. The power supply lines to the AD7276/ \nAD7277 /AD7278  should use as large a trace as possible to \nprovide low impedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supply line. \nTo avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, \ncomponents with fast-switching si gnals, such as clocks, should \nbe shielded with digital ground , and they should never be run \nnear the analog inputs. Avoid c rossover of digital and analog \nsignals. To reduce the effects of feedthrough within the board, \ntraces on opposite sides of the board should run at right angles \nto each other. A microstrip technique is by far the best method, but it is not always possible to use this approach with a double-sided board. In this technique, the component side of the board \nis dedicated to ground planes, and signals are placed on the \nsolder side. Good decoupling is also important. All analog supplies should be decoupled with 10 μF cerami c capacitors in  parallel with \n0.1 μF capacitors to GND. To achieve the best results from these decoupling components, they must be placed as close as \npossible to the device, ideally right up against the device. The \n0.1 μF capacitors should have low effective series resistance \n(ESR) and low effective series inductance (ESI), such as is typical \nof common ceramic or surface-mount types of capacitors. Capacitors with low ESR and low ESI provide a low impedance \npath to ground at high frequencies, which allow them to handle \ntransient currents due to internal logic switching. \nEVALUATING PERFORMANCE \nThe recommended layout for the AD7276/ AD7277/ AD7278 is \noutlined in the evaluation board documentation. The evaluation board package includes a fully assembled and tested evaluation \nboard, documentation, and software for controlling the board from the PC via the evaluation bo ard controller. To  demonstrate/ \nevaluate the ac and dc performance of the AD7276/ AD7277, \nthe evaluation board controller can be used in conjunction with the AD7276/ AD7277 evaluation board, as well as with many \nother Analog Devices evaluation boards ending in the CB designator,  \nThe software allows the user to perform ac (fast Fourier \ntransform) and dc (histogram of codes) tests on the AD7276/ \nAD7277. The software and documentation are on a CD shipped \nwith the evaluation board. \n \n   \nAD7276/AD7277/AD7278 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
