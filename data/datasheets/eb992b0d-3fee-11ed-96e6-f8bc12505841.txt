Functional block diagram of IT151 \n \n\uf075 MIPI RX D -PHY \nMIPI RX D -PHY implements four unidirectional  data lanes and one clock lane. The operating mode of  \ndata lane could be Control or High -Speed mode. However, the clock lane can only support continuous \nclock because the pixel clock for eDP is generated from this differential DDR clock. An internal PLL is \nused to generate the eDP pixel clock. Please refer t o the IT6151 Programming Guide for the PLL \nsetting.  \n \n\uf075 MIPI RX Lane Merge and Packet Decoder  \nBase on the video bandwidth, MIPI RX D -PHY can be configured as 1/2/ 3/4-lane and Lane Merge \nfunction combine s input data to a uniform  32-bit internal bus for further  processing.

Both Sync \nPulse and Sync Event mode are supported by the IT6151. The generated video timing parameters can \nbe over -written by firmware if necessary.  \n \n\uf075 MIPI RX Line Buffer  \nThe active video data of DSI protocol can be transmitted in Non -Burst or Burst mode. The IT6151 \nsupports both modes and Line Buffer is used to hold the burst video data. With this Line Buffer, a \nconstant data throughput can be maintained for eDP  TX. \n \n\uf075 Video Processor and Pattern Generator  \nThe Video Processor uses  the input H/V ti ming to control the video data output from Line Buffer. A \nPattern Generator is embedded in the IT6151 and thus the video data and timing can be easily \nswitched from external MIPI  RX to internal pattern generator for testing.  \n \n\uf075 eDP TX Link Layer  \nThe eDP  TX L ink Layer receives input video data and timing to construct 10 -bit symbol s for \ntransmission. The bandwidth of eDP  TX is varied depends on the setting of Lane number and bit rate. \nThe IT6151 supports 1/2/4 -lane configuration and two bit rates: 2.7Gbps and 1 .62Gbps per lane. User \ncan choose the most suitable setting to reduce the power consumption.  The necessary Secondary \nData Packet is inserted to symbol stream by Link Layer. Please refer to IT6151 Programming Guide \nfor detail setting.  \n \n\uf075 eDP TX AFE  \nThe final step of the data processing flow is eDP TX AFE. The eDP TX driver serializes the input \nparallel data and drive out the proper electrical signals to the eDP panel . The output current level is \ncontrolled through connecting a precision resistor of proper valu e to Pin 25 (REXT).  \n \nITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   9/23 \n \n Supported Packed Pixel Steam  \n\uf075 18-bit per Pixel (Packed) - RGB 4:4:4 , Long Packet  , Data Type 0x1E  \n \n \n\uf075 18-bit per Pixel (Loosely) - RGB 4:4:4 , Long Packet , Data Type 0x2E  \n \n \n\uf075 24-bit per Pixel (Packed) - RGB 4:4:4 , Long Packet , Data T ype 0x3E  \n \n ITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   10/23 \n \n \uf075 30-bit per Pixel (Packed) - RGB 4:4:4 , Long Packet , Data Type 0x0D  \n \n\uf075 36-bit per Pixel (Packed) - RGB 4:4:4 , Long Packet , Data Type 0x1D  \n \n\uf075 16-bit per Pixel (Packed) - YCbCr  4:2:2, Long Packet , Data Type 0x2C  \n \n ITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   11/23 \n \n \uf075 20-bit per Pixel (Packed) - YCbCr  4:2:2, Long Packet , Data Type 0x0C  \n \n \n\uf075 24-bit per Pixel (Packed) - YCbCr  4:2:2, Long Packet , Data Type 0x1C  \n \n \nITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   12/23 \n \n Configuration and Function Control  \nThe IT6151  includes one serial programming port by default  for interfac ing with micro -controller.  This \nport is a slave interface, comprising PCSCL (Pin 2) and PCSDA (Pin 3). The micro -controller uses this \ninterface to monitor all the statuses and control all the functions. Two device addresses are available, \ndepending on the input logic level of PCADR (Pin 31). If PCADR is pulled high by the user, the eDP TX \nslave  address is 0xBA. If pulled low, 0xB8. The slave address of MIPI  RX is programmable and \nenabled by firmware. Please refer to IT6151 Programming Guide for detail.  \n \nThe IT6151 allows the user to access eDP AUX channel through serial programming port. It can be \nused for accessing EDID or DPCD data on Sink side. For temporarily storing the acquired EDID data, \nthe IT6151  embedded  a dedicated FIFO  of 16  bytes. The micro -controller may command the IT61 51 \nto acquire 16 bytes of EDID information  at a time, read them  back and then continue to read the next \n16 bytes until all nec essary EDID information  are retrieved . \n \nThe serial programming  interface conform s to standard I2C transactions and operate s at up to \n100kHz.  \n \nInterrupt Generation  \nThe system micro -controller should monitor the interrupt output by the IT6151  at PIN 4 (INT). The \nIT6151 generates an interrupt signal with events involving various  situations. This interrupt pin can be \nconfigured as push -pull or open -drain I/O with active high or active low. If the system do not use INT \npin, polling interrupt status is another option. Firmware must be implemented to setup initial value of \nregisters and handle interrupt events, otherwise the link establishme nt might fail.

These signals are usually v ery small in amplitudes in addition to \nthe distortion that the cable inflicts on them. The analog  front-end of ITEâ€™ s RX/TX is designed to combat environment \nnoises as well as interference to some degree. However, to get the optimum performance the system d esigners \nshould follow the guideline below when designing the appli cation circuits and PCB layout.  \n \n\uf06c MIPI/eDP Differential Signal  \nThe characteristic impedance of all eDP differential PCB traces (RX2 p/n, RX1 p/n, RX0 p/n, and RXC p/n) \nshould be kept 100Î© all th e way from the eDP connector to ITEâ€™ s RX/TX.  The characteristic impedance of all \nMIPI PCB traces (MIPI p, MIPI n) should be kept 100 Ohm differential, 50 Ohm single -ended per line, and 25 \nOhm common -mode  for both lines together . This is very crucial to the s ystem performance at high speeds. \nWhen routing this differential transmission lines ( 2 single -ended lines in total), the following guidelines should \nbe followed:  \n1. The signals traces should be on the outside layers (e.g. TOP layer) while beneath it there should be a \ncontinuous ground plane  in order to maintain the called micro -strip structure, giving stable and well -defined \ncharacteristic impedances.  \n2. Cornering, through holes, crossing and any irregular signal routing should be avoided  so as to prevent \nfrom disrupting the EM field and creating discontinuity in characteristic impedance.  \n3. ITEâ€™s RX/TX should be placed as close to the MIPI connector as poss ible. Since the differential  signal pins \nof ITEâ€™ s RX/TX perfectly match the order of the connector pins, it is very convenient to route the signal \ndirectly into the chip, without through holes or angling.  \n4. Carefully choose the width and spacing of the diffe rential transmission lines  as their characteristic \nimpedance depends on various parameters of the PCB: trace width, trace spacing, copper thickness, \ndielectric constant, dielectric thickness, etc. Careful 3D EM simulation is the best way to derive a correc t \ndimension that enables nominal 100Î© differential , 50 Ohm single -ended per Line, and 25 Ohm \ncommon -mode  impedance. Please contact us directly for technical support of this issue.  \n5. The sensitive MIPI/eDP differential signals should be taken when routing. To reduce the differential \nunbalanced effect,  it is recommended  to separate at least 3  times  the dielectric thickness between the \nsignal layer and the reference layer to any other adjacent signal or GND plane  to reduce noise inference \nand jitter . (or 25  mils is enough space in almost PCB stack ) \n6. The MIPI/eDP IC should be located as close as possible to the  output /input  connector, thus minimizing \nnoise pickup and reflections  due to impedance mismatch.  It is recommended that the distance between \nthe chip and con nector is less than 5 CM.  \n \n \n ITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   20/23 \n \n \uf06c ESD Consideration  \nSpecial care should be taken when adding discrete ESD devices to all differential PCB traces ( MIPIp/eDPp , \nMIPIn/eDPn ) . ITEâ€™s RX/TX is designed to provide ESD protection for up to 4KV at these  differential pins. \nAdding discrete ESD diodes could enhance the ESD capability, but at the same time will inevitably add \ncapacitive loads, therefore degrade the electrical performance at high speeds. If not chosen carefully, these \ndiodes coupled with less -than-optimal lay out would prevent the system from passing the SINK differential \nImpedance test in the MIPI/ eDP Compliance Tes t. Besides, most general -purpose ESD diodes are relatively \nlarge in size, forcin g the high -speed differential lines to corner several times and therefore introducing severe \nreflection. Carefully choosing an ESD diode that's designed for MIPI/ eDP signaling could lead to a minimum \nloading as well as an optimized layout. Commercially ava ilable devices such as Semtech's RClamp0524 P , \nRClamp052 2P or CitrusComâ€™ s CS0806S  that take into consideration of all aspects are recommended.  \n(http://www.semtech.com/products/product  or http://www.ci truscomsemi.com  ) A layout example is shown in \nFig. 1, with referenced FR4 PCB structure included. Note that the ESD diodes should be placed as close to the \nMIPI/ eDP connectors as possible to yield the best ESD performances.  \n \nNotes: The PCB stack and mater ial will affect differential impedance. The customer shall co -work with PCB \nprovider to obtain the real 100 ohm differential, 5 0 Ohm single -ended per Line, and 25 Ohm common -mode  \nimpedance based on actual PCB stack and material.  \nITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   21/23 \n \n  \nPower Sequence  \n \nITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   22/23 \n \n Package Dimensions  \n \n \n \nFigure 3. 48-pin QFN  Package Dimensions  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n ITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n \n \nIT6151  \n \n \nwww.ite.com.tw   T8720F V0.7.1   \nMar-2019 Rev:1.00c   23/23 \n \n Top Marking Information  \n \n \n \nITE Confidential for Micro Electronics Only\n"}]
