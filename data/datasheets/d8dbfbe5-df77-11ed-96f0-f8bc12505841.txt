This controller features a high current gatedriver along with high−speed logic circuitry to provide\nappropriately timed drive signals to a synchronous\nrectification MOSFET. With its novel architecture, theNCP4303 has enough versatility to keep the synchronousrectification system efficient under any operating mode.\nThe NCP4303 works from an available bias supply with\nvoltage range from 10.4 V to 28 V (typical). The wide V\nCC\nrange allows direct connection to the SMPS output voltage\nof most adapters such as notebook and LCD TV adapters. As\na result, the NCP4303 simplifies circuit operation compared\nto other devices that require specific bias power supply (e.g.5 V). The high voltage capability of the V\nCC pin is also a\nunique feature designed to allow operation for a broaderrange of applications.\nPrecise turn off threshold of the current sense comparator\ntogether with accurate offset  current source allows the user\nto adjust for any required turn off current threshold of the SR\nMOSFET switch using a single resistor. Compared to other\nSR controllers that provide turn off thresholds in the rangeof −10 mV to −5 mV , the NCP4303 offers a turn offthreshold of 0 mV that in combination with a low R\nDS(on)  SR\nMOSFET significantly reduces the turn off currentthreshold and improves efficiency.\nTo overcome issues after turn on and off events, the\nNCP4303 provides adjustable minimum on time and off\ntime blanking periods. Blanking times can be adjusted\nindependently of IC V\nCC using resistors connected to GND.\nIf needed, blanking periods can be modulated usingadditional components.\nThe NCP4303 ZCD comparator features very short\nturn-off delay time. This allows the SR controller to be used\nin applications operating in shallow CCM mode without anyextra primary side synchronization circuitry (refer to\nFigures 2 and 60). This circuit exhibits excellent efficiencyresults (refer to Figures 58 and 59). A typical example of\nsuch an application is a flyback notebook adapter thatusually enters only shallow CCM when Vbulk is lower than\napproximately 180 Vdc. On the other hand, the turn-off\ndelay could be too long for applications operating in deepCCM (like high output current flyback or forwardconverters). High reverse current spikes and also drainvoltage ringing are then usually present on the SR MOSFET.\nThis is because the SR MOSFET needs some time to fullyturn-off. The NCP4303 offers an optional ultrafast turn-offtrigger input to prevent these current spikes and drain\nvoltage ringing. This input can be used to turn-off the SR\nMOSFET earlier, using a synchronization signal from theprimary side. The SR MOSFET is then turned-off prior toit’s drain voltage reversing thus the reverse current isminimized while the efficiency is maximized (refer toFigure 46 for a deep CCM flyback converter example).Using the trigger input is optional and only recommendedfor applications operating in deep CCM. Additionally, the\ntrigger input can be used to disable the IC and activate a low\nconsumption standby mode. This feature can be used todecrease standby consumption of an SMPS.\nFinally, the NCP4303 features a special input that can be\nused to automatically compensate for SR MOSFETparasitic inductance effect. This technique achieves themaximum available on−time and thus optimizes efficiencywhen a MOSFET in standard package (like TO220 or\nTO247) is used. If a SR MOSFET in SMT package with\nnegligible inductance is used, the compensation input isconnected to GND pin.\nZero Current Detection and parasitic inductance\ncompensation\nFigure 33 shows the internal connection of the ZCD\ncircuitry on the current sense input. The synchronousrectification MOSFET is depicted with it’s parasitic\ninductances to demonstrate operation of the compensation\nsystem.\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n13\nFigure 33. ZCD Sensing Circuitry Functionality\nWhen the voltage on the secondary winding of the SMPS\nreverses, the body diode of M1 starts to conduct current and\nthe voltage of M1’s drain drops approximately to −1 V . The\nCS pin sources current of 100 /C0109A that creates a voltage drop\non the R shift_cs  resistor. Once the voltage on the CS pin is\nlower than V th_cs_on  threshold, M1 is turned on. Because of\nparasitic impedances, significant ringing can occur in theapplication. To  overcome sudden turn−off due to mentioned\nringing, the minimum conduction time of the SR MOSFET\nis activated. Minimum conduction time can be adjustedusing R\n_Min_Ton  resistor.The SR MOSFET is turned−off as soon as the voltage on\nthe CS pin is higher than V th_cs_off . For the same ringing\nreason, a minimum off time timer is asserted once the\nturn−off is detected. The minimum off time can be\nexternally adjusted using R _Min_Toff  resistor. MOSFET M1\nchannel conducts when the secondary current decreases,therefore the turn−off time depends on its R\nDS(on) . The 0 mV\nthreshold provides an optimum switching period usagewhile keeping enough time margin for the gate turn off. The\nR\nshift_cs  resistor provides the designer with the possibility to\nmodify (increase) the actual turn−off current threshold.\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n14\nFigure 34. ZCD Comparators Thresholds and Blanking Periods Timing\nIf no R shift_cs  resistor is used, the turn−on and turn−off\nthresholds are fully given by the CS input specification(please refer to parametric table). Once non−zero R\nshift_cs\nresistor is used, both thresholds move down (i.e. higherMOSFET turn off current) as the CS pin offset currentcauses a voltage drop that is equal to:\nV_Rshift_cs /C0043Rshift_cs * Ishift_cs (eq. 1)\nFinal turn−on and turn off thresholds can be then calculated\nas:\nVCS_turn_on /C0043Vth_CS_on /C0042(Rshift_cs * Ishift_cs)\n(eq. 2)\nVCS_turn_off /C0043Vth_CS_off /C0042(Rshift_cs * Ishift_cs)\n(eq. 3)Note that R shift_cs  impact on turn−on threshold is less critical\ncompare to turn−of f threshold.\nIf using a SR MOSFET in TO220 package (or other\npackage which features leads), the parasitic inductance of\nthe package leads causes a turn−off current thresholdincrease. This is because current that flows through the SRMOSFET has quite high di(t)/dt that induces error voltageon the SR MOSFET leads inductance. This error voltage,that is proportional to the secondary current derivative,shifts the CS input voltage to zero when significant currentstill flows through the channel. Zero current threshold is thus\ndetected when current still flows through the SR MOSFET\nchannel – please refer to Figure 35  for better understanding.\nAs a result, the SR MOSFET is turned−of f prematurely and\nthe efficiency of the SMPS is not optimized.\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n15\nFigure 35. Waveforms from SR System Using MOSFET in TO220 Package without Parasitic Inductance\nCompensation – SR MOSFET Channel Conduction Time is Reduced\nNote that the efficiency impact of the error caused by\nparasitic inductance increases with lower R DS(on)\nMOSFETs and/or higher operating frequency.The NCP4303 offers a way to compensate for MOSFET\nparasitic inductances effect − refer to Figure 36.\nFigure 36. Package Parasitic Inductances Compensation Principle\nDedicated input (COMP) offers the possibility to use an\nexternal compensation inductance (wire strap or PCB). Ifthe value of this compensation inductance is L\ncomp = L drain\n+ L source , the compensation voltage created on this\ninductance is exactly the same as the sum of error voltagescreated on drain and source parasitic inductances i.e. VL\ndrain\n+ VL source . The internal analog inverter (Figure 33) inverts\ncompensation voltage Vl_comp and offsets the currentsense comparator turn−off threshold. The current sensecomparator thus “sees” between its terminals a voltage thatwould be seen on the SR MOSFET channel resistance in\ncase the lead inductances wouldn’t exist. The current sensecomparator of the NCP4303 is thus able to detect the\nsecondary current zero crossing very precisely. More over,\nthe secondary current turn−off threshold is then di(t)/tindependent thus the NCP4303 allows to increase operating\nfrequency of the SR system. One should note that theparasitic resistance of compensation inductance should be as\nlow as possible compared to the SR MOSFET channel andleads resistance otherwise compensation is not efficient.\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n16Typical value of compensation inductance for a TO220\npackage is 7 nH. The parasitic inductance can differ depends\non how much are the leads shortened during the assembly\nprocess. The compensation inductance design has to be done\nwith enough margin to overcome situation that the systemwill become overcompensated due to packaging and\nassembly process variations. Waveforms from theapplication with compensated SR system can be seen in\nFigure 37. One can see the conduction time has been\nsignificantly increased and turn−off current reduced.\nFigure 37. Waveforms from SR System Using MOSFET in TO220 Package with Parasitic Inductance\nCompensation – SR MOSFET Channel Conduction Time Optimized\nNote that using the compensation system is only\nbeneficial in applications that are using a low R DS(on)\nMOSFET in non−SMT package. Using the compensation\nmethod allows for optimized efficiency with a standard\nTO220 package that in turn results in reduced costs, as theSMT MOSFETs usually require reflow soldering processand more expensive PCB.\nFrom the above paragraphs and parameter tables it is\nevident that turn−off threshold precision is quite critical. If\nwe consider a SR MOSFET with R\nDS(on)  of 1 m /C0087, the 1 mV\nerror voltage on the CS pin results in a 1 A turn−off current\nthreshold difference. Thus the PCB layout is very critical\nwhen implementing the SR system. Note that the CSturn−off comparator as well as compensation inputs are\nreferred to the GND pin. Any parasitic impedance (resistive\nor inductive − talking about m /C0087 and nH values) can cause\na high error voltage that is then evaluated by the CScomparator. Ideally the CS turn–off comparator should\ndetect voltage that is caused by secondary current directly on\nthe SR MOSFET channel resistance. Practically this is not\npossible because of the bonding wires, leads and soldering.\nTo assure the best efficiency results, a Kelvin connection ofthe SR controller to the power circuitry should beimplemented (i.e. GND pin should be connected to the SRMOSFET source soldering point and current sense pinshould be connected to the SR MOSFET drain solderingpoint). Any impact of PCB parasitic elements on the SRcontroller functionality is then avoided. Figures 38 and 39\nshow examples of SR system layouts using parasitic\ninductance compensation (i.e. for low R\nDS(on)  MOSFET in\nTO220 package ) and not using compensation (i.e. for higher\nRDS(on)  MOSFET in TO220 package or SMT package\nMOSFETs ).\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n17\nFigure 38. Recommended Layout for SO8 Package\nWhen Parasitic Inductance Compensation is Used\nFigure 39. Recommended Layout for SO8 Package\nWhen Parasitic Inductance Compensation is Not\nUsed\nTrigger/Disable input\nThe NCP4303 features an ultrafast trigger input that\nexhibits a typically of 12 ns delay from its activation to theturn−off of the SR MOSFET. This input offers a possibility\nto turn−off the SR MOSFET in applications that operates in\ndeep CCM via a signal coming from the primary side.Efficiency and SR performance can be thus furtheroptimized (refer also to application information on page 12).\nThe primary trigger signal rising edge should come to thetrigger input before the secondary voltage reverses. Thus the\ndriver signal for primary switch should be delayed – refer to\nfigure 46 for one possible method of delaying the primarydriving signal in CCM flyback topology. The trigger signal\nis disabled from the end of the minimum off time period tothe end of the minimum on time period. This technique is\nused to:\na) Overcome false turn−off of the gate driver in case the\nsynchronization pulse is too wide and comes twice perswitching period (in HB and HB LLC applications).\nb) Increase trigger input noise immunity against the parasitic\nringing that is present in the SMPS layout during the turn on\nprocess.\nFigure 40. Trigger Input Internal Connection\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n18\nFigure 41. Trigger Input Functionality Waveforms\nThe NCP4303 operation can be disabled using the\ntrigger/disable input. If the trigger/disable input is pulled up\n(above 1.5 V) the driver is disabled immediately. In some\ncases, the driver is activated one more time by the current\nsense because the trigger signal is still blanked. This finaldrive pulse lasts only for the minimum on time period. If the\ntrigger signal is high for more than 100  /C0109s, the driver enters\nstandby mode. Note that a short pulse (2  /C0109s maximally) can\nappear on the DRV pin during transition to sleep mode incase there was no switching on the CS input prior transition\n− refer to Figure 44. This behavior is related to the internalIC logic structure and may cause unwanted SR MOSFET\nactivation in some applications. It is recommended todisable NCP4303 driver via V\nCC pin in such cases − refer to\nFigure 61. The IC consumption is reduced to 390  /C0109A during\nthe standby mode. When trigger input voltage is decreasedagain the device recovers operation in 500 ns. If the IC isenabled in the time the current sense input voltage isnegative (secondary current flows through the Shottky orbody diode) the IC waits for another switching cycle toturn−on the SR MOSFET – refer to Figures 42, 43 44,\nand 45.\nFigure 42.

Operating Waveforms for the Trig/Disable Input − Device Sleep Mode Transition − Case 3\n \nFigure 45. Operating Waveforms for the Trig/Disable Input –Wake−up from Sleep Mode\nIf the trigger signal comes periodically and the trigger\npulse overlaps the SR MOSFET drain positive voltage (i.e.overlaps the whole SR MOSFET body diode off timeperiod), the driver is disabled for the next cycle – refer to\nFigure 46.\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n20\nFigure 46. Operating Waveforms for the Trig/Disable Input with a Trigger Signal that is Periodical and Overlaps\nCS (SR MOSFET Vds) High Level\nNote that the trigger input is an ultrafast input that doesn’t\nfeature any internal filtering and reacts even on very narrowvoltage pulses. Thus it is wise to keep this input on a low\nimpedance path and provide it with a clean triggering signal.\nA typical application schematic of a flyback converter that\nis operated in deep CCM mode can be seen in Figure 47. Inthis application the trigger signal is taken directly from theflyback controller driver output and transmitted to thesecondary side by pulse transformer TR2. Because thetrigger input is rising edge sensitive, it is not necessary totransmit the entire primary driver pulse to the secondary.\nThe coupling capacitor C5 is used to allow pulse transformer\ncore reset and also to prepare a needle pulse (a pulse withwidth lower than 100 ns) to be transmitted to the NCP4303\ntrigger input. The advantage of needle trigger pulse usage is\nthat the required volt−second product of the pulsetransformer is very low and that allows the designer to usevery small and cheap magnetics. The trigger transformer canbe for instance prepared on a small toroidal ferrite core with\ndiameter of 8 mm. Proper safety insulation between primary\nand secondary sides can be easily assured by using triple\ninsulated wire for one or even both windings.\nThe primary MOSFET gate voltage rising edge is delayed\nby external circuitry consisting of transistors Q1, Q2 andsurrounding components. The primary MOSFET is thusturned−on with a slight delay so that the secondary\ncontroller turns−off the SR MOSFET by trigger signal prior\nto the primary switching. This method reduces thecommutation losses and the SR MOSFET drain voltage\nspike, which results in improved efficiency.\nIt is also possible to use capacitive coupling (use\nadditional capacitor with safety insulation) between theprimary and secondary to transmit the trigger signal. We do\nnot recommend this technique as the parasitic capacitivecurrents between primary and secondary may affect thetrigger signal and thus overall system functionality.\nFigure 47. Optional Application Schematic When NCP4303 is Used in CCM Flyback Converter and Trigger Input is\nImplemented to Maximize Efficiency\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n21Minimum T on and T off Adjustment\nThe NCP4303 offers adjustable minimum ON and OFF\ntime periods that ease the implementation of thesynchronous rectification system in a power supply. Thesetimers avoid false triggering on the CS input after the\nMOSFET is turned on or off. The adjustment is based on an\ninternal timing capacitance and external resistors connected\nto the GND pin – refer to Figure 48 for better understanding.\nFigure 48. Internal Connection of the Min_Ton Generator (the Min_Toff Works in the Same Way)\nCurrent through the Min_Ton adjust resistor can be\ncalculated as:\nIR_Ton_min/C0043Vref\nRTon_min(eq. 4)\nAs the same current is used for the internal timing\ncapacitor (Ct) charging, one can calculate the minimumon−time duration using this equation.\nTon_min/C0043Ct/C0064Vref\nIR_Ton_min/C0043Ct/C0043Vref\nVref\nRTon_min(eq. 5)\n/C0043Ct/C0064RTon_min\nAs can be seen from Equation 5, the minimum ON and\nOFF times are independent of the V ref or V CC level. Theinternal capacitor size would be too high if we would use\ndirectly I R_Ton_min  current thus this current is decreased by\nthe internal current mirror ratio. One can then calculate the\nminimum T on and T off blanking periods using below\nequations:\nTon_min/C00439.82 * 10−11*RT_on_min/C00414.66 * 10−8[/C0109s]\n(eq. 6)\nToff_min/C00439.56 * 10−11*RT_off_min/C00415.397 * 10−8[/C0109s]\n(eq. 7)\nNote that the internal timing comparator delay affects the\naccuracy of Equations 6 and 7 when T on/Toff times are\nselected near to their minimum possible values.

With NCP4303 it is possible tomodulate blanking periods by using an external NPN\ntransistor – refer to Figure 51. The modulation signal can be\nderived based on the load current or feedback regulator\nvoltage.\nFigure 51. Possible Connection for Min T on and T off Modulation\nIn LLC applications with a very wide operating frequency\nrange it is necessary to have very short minimum on time and\noff time periods in order to reach the required maximum\noperating frequency. However, when a LLC converter\noperates under low frequency, the minimum off time periodmay then be too short. To overcome possible issues with the\nLLC operating under low line and light load conditions, onecan prolong the minimum off time blanking period by using\nresistors R\ndrain1  and R drain2  connected from the opposite SR\nMOSFET drain – refer to Figure 52.\nFigure 52. Possible Connection for Min Toff Prolongation in LLC Applications with Wide Operating Frequency\nRange\n\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n23Note that R drain1  and R drain2  should be designed in such\na way that the maximum pulse current into the Min_Toffadjust pin is below 10 mA. V oltage on the min T\noff and T on\npins is clamped by internal zener protection to 10 V .\nPower Dissipation Calculation\nIt is important to consider the power dissipation in the\nMOSFET driver of a SR system. If no external gate resistor\nis used and the internal gate resistance of the MOSFET is\nvery low, nearly all energy losses related to gate charge are\ndissipated in the driver. Thus it is necessary to check the SR\ndriver power losses in the target application to avoid overtemperature and to optimize efficiency.\nIn SR systems the body diode of the SR MOSFET starts\nconducting before turn on because the V\nth_cs_on  threshold\nlevel is below 0 V. On the other hand, the SR MOSFET turnoff process always starts before the drain to source voltage\nrises up significantly. Therefore, the MOSFET switchalways operates under Zero V oltage Switching (ZVS)\nconditions when implemented in a synchronous\nrectification system.\nThe following steps show how to approximately calculate\nthe power dissipation and DIE temperature of theNCP4303A/B controller. Note that real results can vary due\nto the effects of the PCB layout on the thermal resistance.\nStep 1 – MOSFET gate to source capacitance:\nDuring ZVS operation the gate to drain capacitance does\nnot have a Miller effect like in hard switching systemsbecause the drain to source voltage is close to zero and itschange is negligible.\n \nFigure 53. Typical MOSFET Capacitances Dependency on V ds and V gs VoltagesCiss/C0043Cgs/C0041Cgd\nCrss/C0043Cgd\nCoss/C0043Cds/C0041Cgd\nTherefore, the input capacitance of a MOSFET operating\nin ZVS mode is given by the parallel combination of the gateto source and gate to drain capacitances (i.e. C\niss capacitance\nfor given gate to source voltage). The total gate charge,\nQg_total , of most MOSFETs on the market is defined for hard\nswitching conditions. In order to accurately calculate thedriving losses in a SR system, it is necessary to determine the\ngate charge of the MOSFET for operation specifically in aZVS system. Some manufacturers define this parameter asQ\ng_ZVS . Unfortunately, most datasheets do not provide this\ndata. If the C iss (or Q g_ZVS ) parameter is not available then\nit will need to be measured. Please note that the input\ncapacitance is not linear (as shown Figure 53) and it needsto be characterized for a given gate voltage clamp level.\nStep 2 – Gate drive losses calculation:\nGate drive losses are affected by the gate driver clamp\nvoltage. Gate driver clamp voltage selection depends on the\ntype of MOSFET used (threshold voltage versus channelresistance). The total power losses (driving loses andconduction losses) should be considered when selecting the\ngate driver clamp voltage. Most of today’s MOSFETs for SR\nsystems feature low R\nDS(on)  for 5 V V gs voltage and thus itis beneficial to use NCP4303B. However, there is still a big\ngroup of MOSFETs on the market that require higher gateto source voltage − in this case the NCP4303A should be\nused.\nThe total driving loss can be calculated using the selected\ngate driver clamp voltage and the input capacitance of theMOSFET:\nPDRV_total/C0043VCC/C0064Vclamp/C0064Cg_ZVS/C0064fSW (eq. 8)\nWhere:\nVcc is the NCP4303x supply voltage\nVclamp  is the driver clamp voltage\nCg_ZVS  is the gate to source capacitance of the MOSFET in\nZVS modef\nsw is the switching frequency of the target application\nThe total driving power loss won’t only be dissipated in\nthe IC, but also in external resistances like the external gate\nresistor (if used) and the MOSFET internal gate resistance(Figure 54). Because NCP4303A/B features a clampeddriver, it’s high side portion can be modeled as a regulardriver switch with equivalent resistance and a series voltage\nsource. The low side driver switch resistance does not drop\nNCP4303A, NCP4303B\nwww. onsemi.com\n24immediately at turn−off, thus it is necessary to use an\nequivalent value (R drv_low_eq ) for calculations. This method\nsimplifies power losses calculations and still providesacceptable accuracy. Internal driver power dissipation can\nthen be calculated using Equation 9:\nFigure 54.

This power loss is given by theI\nCC current and the IC supply voltage. The I CC current\ndepends on switching frequency and also on the selected min\nTon and T off periods because there is current flowing out\nfrom the min T on and T off pins. The most accurate method\nfor calculating these losses is to measure the I cc current when\nCload = 0 nF and the IC is switching at the target frequency\nwith given Min_Ton and Min_Toff adjust resistors.
