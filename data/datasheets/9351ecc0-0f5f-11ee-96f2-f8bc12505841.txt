Features and Functional Blocks  \n10.1  Device Startup and Power -on-Reset  \nThe 5P49V6975  has an internal power- up reset (POR) circuit. All VDDs must be connected to  the desired supply voltage to trigger a POR.  \nThe user can define specific default configurations through internal One- Time -Programmable (OTP) memory -- either the user or factory can \nprogram the default configuration. Contact Renesas if a specific factory -programmed default configuration is required, or refer to the VersaClock \n6E Programming Guide.   \nThe device will identity which of the two modes to operate in by the state of the OUT0_SEL_I2CB pin at POR. Both modes’ default configurations \ncan be programm ed as follows:  \n1. Software Mode  (I2C): OUT0_SEL_I2CB is low at POR.  \nThe I2C interface will be open to users for in -system programming, overriding device default configurations at any time.  \n2. Hardware Select Mode:  OUT0_SEL_I2CB is high at POR.  \nThe device has been programmed to load OTP at power- up (REG0[7] = 1). The device will load internal registers according to Table 19.\n Power -Up Behavior.  \nInternal OTP memory can support up to four configurations, which selectable by the SEL0/SEL1 pins.  \nAt POR, logic levels at SEL0 and SEL1 pins must be settled,  which results in the selected configuration to be loaded at power up.  \nAfter the first 10ms of operation, the levels of the SELx pins can be changed, either to low or to the same level as VDDD/VDDA. The SELx \npins must be driven with a digital signal of < 300ns rise/fall time and only a single pin can be changed at a time. After a pin level change, \nthe device must not be interrupted for at least 1ms so that the new values have time to load and take effect.  \n \nTable 19.

A single- ended clock can also drive it on \nCLKIN.  \nFigure 7. Clock Input Diagram  Internal Logic  \n CLKIN\nCLKINB\nCLKSELOTP\nand \nControl \nLogicPRIMSRC\nR eg  0x13[1]Internal \nCystal\n \n10.3  Manual Switchover  \nThe CLKSEL  pin selects  the input  clock  between  either the internal crystal  or (CLKIN,  CLKINB). CLKSEL polarity can be changed by I2C \nprogramming (Byte 0x13[1]) as shown in the following table.  \n\uf0a7 0 = Internal crystal (default)  \n\uf0a7 1 = CLKIN, CLKINB  \nTable 20. Input Clock Select  \nPRIMSRC  CLKSEL  Source  \n0 0 Internal crystal  \n0 1 CLKIN,  CLKINB  \n1 0 CLKIN,  CLKINB  \n1 1 Internal crystal  \n \nWhen SM[1:0] is “0x”, the redundant inputs are in manual switchover mode. In this mode, CLKSEL pin is used to switch between the primary \nand secondary clock sources. The PRIMSRC bit determines the primary and secondary clock source setting. During the swit chover, no glitches \nwill occur at the output of the device, although there may be frequency and phase drift depending on the exact phase and freq uency relationship \nbetween  the primary  and secondary  clocks.  \n 5P49V6975 Datasheet  \n \n© 2018 -2023  Renesas Electronics Corporation  19 February 2, 2023  \n 10.4  Programmable Loop Filter  \nThe device PLL  loop bandwidth  operating range  depends  on the input  reference  frequency  (Fref).  \nTable 21. Loop Filter Settings  \nInput  Reference  \nFrequency (MHz)  Loop Bandwidth  \nMinimum  (kHz)  Loop Bandwidth  \nMaximum  (kHz)  \n1 40 126 \n350 300 1000  \n10.5  Fractional Output Dividers (FOD)  \nThe 5P49V6975  has four fractional output dividers (FOD). Each FOD is comprised of a 12- bit integer counter and a 24- bit fractional counter. \nThe output divider can operate in integer divide only mode for improved performance, or use the fractional counters to generate a clock \nfrequency accurate to 50ppb.  \nFODs support the following features.  \n10.5.1 Individual Spread Spectrum Modulation \nThe output clock frequencies can be modulated to spread energy across a broader range of frequencies, thereby lowering system EMI. Each \ndivider has individual spread ability. Spread modulation independent of output frequency, a triangle wave modulation between 30 and 63kHz.  \nSpread spectrum can be applied to any output clock, clock frequency, or spread amount from ±0.25% to ±2.5% center- spread and -0.5% to - 5% \ndown- spread.  \n10.5.2 Bypass Mode \nBypass mode (divide by 1) allows the output to behave as a buffered copy from the input or another FOD.  \n10.5.3 Cascaded Mode  \nAs shown in the block diagram on page 1, FODs can be cascaded for lower output frequency.  \nFor example, if OUT1 is configured to run at 12.288MHz and needs another 48kHz output, the user can cascade FOD2 by taking input from \nOUT1, with a divide ratio of 256. As a result, OUT 2 runs at 48kHz while in alignment with 12.288MH z on OUT1.  \n10.5.4 Dividers Alignment  \nEach output divider block has a synchronizing pulse to provide startup alignment between outputs dividers. This allows alignm ent of outputs for \nlow skew performance.  \nWhen the 5P49V6975  is in hardware select mode, outputs are automatically aligned at POR. The same synchronization reset is also triggered \nwhen switching between configurations with the SEL0/1 pins. This ensures that the outputs remain aligned in every configuration.  \nWhen the 5P49V6975  is using software mode, I2C is used to reprogram an output divider during operation, and therefore, alignment can be \nlost. Alignment can be restored by manually triggering a reset through I2C. \nThe outputs are aligned on the falling edges of each output by default. Rising edge alignm ent can also be achieved by using the programmable \nskew feature to delay the faster clock by 180 degrees. The programmable skew feature also allows for fine tuning of the align ment.  \n 5P49V6975 Datasheet  \n \n© 2018 -2023  Renesas Electronics Corporation  20 February 2, 2023  \n 10.5.5 Programmable Skew  \nThe 5P49V6975  can skew outputs by quadrature values. The skew on each output can be adjusted from 0 to 360 degrees. Skew is adjusted \nin units equal to 1/32 of the VCO period. As a result, for 100MHz output and a 2800MHz VCO, the user can select how many 11.161ps units to \nbe added to the skew (resulting in unit s of 0.402 degrees). For example, 0, 0.402, 0.804, 1.206, 1.408, and so on. The granularity of the skew \nadjustment is always dependent on the VCO period and the output period.  \n10.6  Output Drivers  \nDevice output drivers can individually support the following features:  \n\uf0a7 2.5V or 3.3V voltage level for HCSL/LVPECL operation  \n\uf0a7 1.8V, 2.5V, or 3.3V voltage levels for CMOS/LVDS operation  \n\uf0a7 CMOS supports four operating modes:  \n•  CMOSD: OUTx and OUTxB 180 degrees out of phase  \n•  CMOSX2: OUTx and OUTxB phase -aligne d \n•  CMOS1: only OUTx pin is on  \n•  CMOS2: only OUTxB pin is on \nWhen a given output is configured to CMOSD or CMOSX2, then all previously described configuration and control apply equally to both \npins.  \n\uf0a7 Independent output enable/disabled by register bits. When disabled, an output can be either in a logic 1 state or Hi- Z. \n \nThe following options are used to disable outputs: \n\uf0a7 Output turned off by I2C \n\uf0a7 Output turned off by SD/OE pin  \n\uf0a7 Output unused, which means it is turned off regardless of OE pin status \n10.7  SD/OE Pin Function \nThe SD/OE pin can be programmed as follows:  \n\uf0a7 OE output enable (low active)  \n\uf0a7 OE output enable (high active)  \n\uf0a7 Global shutdown (low active)  \n\uf0a7 Global shutdown (high active)  \n \nOutput behavior when disabled is also programmable. The user can select the output driver behavior when it is off as follows:  \n\uf0a7 OUTx pin high, OUTxB pin low (controlled by SD/OE pin)  \n\uf0a7 OUTx/OUTxB Hi -Z (controlled by SD/OE pin)  \n\uf0a7 OUTx pin high, OUTxB pin low (configured through I2C) \n\uf0a7 OUTx/OUTxB Hi -Z (configured by I2C) \n \nThe user can disable the output with either I2C or SD/OE pin.

The interface accepts byte- oriented block write and block read operations.  \nAddress bytes (2 bytes) specify the register address of the byte position of the first register to write or read.  \nData bytes (registers) are accessed in sequential order from the lowest to the highest byte (most significant bit first).  \nRead and write block transfers can be stopped after any complete byte transfer. During a write operation, data will not be moved into the \nregisters until the STOP bit is received, at which point, all data received in the block write will be written simultaneously.  \nFor full electrical I2C compliance, use external pull- up resistors for SDATA and SCLK.  \nFigure 8.

However, since it is internally AC coupled it can \naccept both LVDS and LVPECL input signals.  \nOccasionally it may be desired to have CLKIN to take CMOS levels. The following example shows how this can be achieved. This configuration \nhas three properties:  \n1. Total output impedance of Ro and Rs matches the 50 Ω transmission line impedance  \n2. Vrx voltage is generated at the CLKIN , which maintains the LVCMOS driver voltage level across the transmission line for best S/N  \n3. R1–R2 voltage divider values ensure that Vrx p -p at CLKIN is less than the maximum value of 1.2V  \n \nFigure 10. Recommended Schematic for Driving CLKIN with LVCMOS Driver  \n \n \nTable 22 shows resistor values  that ensure  the maximum  drive level  for the CLKIN port is not exceeded for all combinations of 5% tolerance  \non the driver  VDD, VDDO0  and 5%  resistor  tolerances.  The values  of the  resistors  can be adjusted  to reduce  the loading  for slower and weaker  \nLVCMOS  driver  by increasing  the impedance  of the R1–R2 divider.  To better assist  this assessment,  the total load (Ro+Rs+R1+R2) on the \ndriver  is included  in the table.  \nTable 22.

The actual value should  \nbe selected to match the differential impedance (Zo) of your transmission  line. A typical point- to-point LVDS  design uses a 100Ω  parallel  \nresistor at the receiver and a 100Ω. Differential transmission- line environment. In order  to avoid any transmission- line reflection issues,  the \ncomponents should be surface  mounted and must  be placed  as close to the receiver  as possible.  The standard termination schematic as \nshown in figure Standard Termination or the termination of figure Optional Termination can be used,  which uses a center tap capacitance to \nhelp filter common mode  noise.  The capacitor value should be approximately 50pF.  In addition, since these outputs are LVDS compatible,  \nthe input  receiver's amplitude and common -mode  input  range should be verified for compatibility with the Renesas LVDS  output.   \nFor example, the LVDS  outputs can be AC coupled  by placing capacitors  between the LVDS outputs and the 100Ω shunt load. This is a \ncommon practice with a receiver with internal self- bias circuitry. If using  a non-standard termination,  it is recommended  to contact Renesas  \nand confirm  that the termination will function as intended.  \n \nFigure 12.

The differential outputs generate ECL/LVPECL compatible \noutputs. Therefore, terminating resistors (DC current path to ground) or current sources must be used for f unctionality. These outputs are \ndesigned to drive 50 Ω transmission lines. Matched impedance t echniques should be used to maximize operating frequency and minimize signal \ndistortion.  For VDDO = 2.5V, the VDDO –  2V is very close to ground level.
