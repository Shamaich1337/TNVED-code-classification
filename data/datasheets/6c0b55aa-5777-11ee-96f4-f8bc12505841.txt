MIPI INTERFACE (MOBILE INDUSTRY PROCESSING INTERFACE)  \nThe Display Serial Interface standard defines protocols between a host processor and \nperipheral devices that adhere to MIPI Alliance standards for mobile device interfaces. The \nDSI standard builds on existing standards by adopting pixel formats and command  set \ndefined in MIPI Alliance standards.  \nDSI-compliant peripherals support either of two basic modes of operation: Command Mode \nand Video Mode. Which mode is used depends on the architecture and capabilities of the \nperipheral. The mode definitions reflect  the primary intended use of DSI for display \ninterconnect, but are not intended to restrict DSI from operating in other applications.  \nCommand Mode refers to operation in which transactions primarily take the form of sending \ncommands and data to a peripher al, such as a display module, that incorporates a display \ncontroller. The display controller may include local registers. Systems using Command Mode \nwrite to, and read from, the registers. The host processor indirectly controls activity at the \nperipheral b y sending commands, parameters and data to the display controller. The host \nprocessor can also read display module status information. Command Mode operation \nrequires a bidirectional interface.  \nVideo Mode refers to operation in which transfers from the ho st processor to the peripheral \ntake the form of a real -time pixel stream. In normal operation, the display module relies on the \nhost processor to provide image data at sufficient bandwidth to avoid flicker or other visible \nartifacts in the displayed image.  Video information should only be transmitted using High \nSpeed Mode. To reduce complexity and cost, systems that only operate in Video Mode may \nuse a unidirectional data path.  \nMIPI Lane Configuration:  \n \n\n \nRFH70BA8 -AYH-MNG  \n \nPage 29 , Total 43 Pages  \n11.2. Display Serial Interface (DSI)  \nVideo Mode Co mmunication  \nVideo Mode peripherals require pixel data delivered in real time. This section specifies the \nformat and timing of DSI traffic for this type of display module.  \nTransmission Packet Sequences  \nDSI supports several formats, or packet sequences, f or Video Mode data transmission. The \nperipheral’s timing requirements dictate which format is appropriate. These terms are used \nthroughout the following sections:  \n Non-Burst Mode with Sync Pulses — enables the peripheral to accurately reconstruct \norigina l video timing, including sync pulse widths.  \n \n Non-Burst Mode with Sync Events — similar to above, but accurate reconstruction of sync \npulse widths is not required, so a single Sync Event is substituted.  \n \n Burst mode — RGB pixel packets are time -compre ssed, leaving more time during a scan \nline for LP mode(saving power) or for multiplexing other transmissions onto the DSI link.  \n \nIn the following figures the Blanking or Low -Power Interval (BLLP) is defined as a period \nduring which video packets such as p ixel-stream and sync event packets are not actively \ntransmitted to the peripheral. To enable PHY synchronization the host processor should \nperiodically end HS transmission and drive the Data Lanes to the LP state. This transition \nshould take place at least  once per frame; shown as LPM in the figures in this section. It is \nrecommended to return to LP state once per scanline during the horizontal blanking time. \nRegardless of the frequency of BLLP periods, the host processor is responsible for meeting \nall docu mented peripheral timing requirements. Note, at lower frequencies BLLP periods will \napproach, or become, zero.  \nDuring the BLLP the DSI Link may do any of the following:  \n Remain in Idle Mode with the host processor in LP -11 state and the peripheral in LP -RX.  \n Transmit one or more non -video packets from the host processor to the peripheral using \nEscape Mode.  \n Transmit one or more non -video packets from the host processor to the peripheral using \nHS Mode.  \n If the previous processor -to-peripheral transm ission ended with BTA, transmit one or more \npackets from the peripheral to the host processor using Escape Mode.  \n Transmit one or more packets from the host processor to a different peripheral using a \ndifferent Virtual Channel ID.  \nThe sequence of packet s within the BLLP or RGB portion of a HS transmission is arbitrary. \nThe host processor may compose any sequence of packets, including iterations, within the \nlimits of the packet format definitions. For all timing cases, the first line of a frame shall star t \nwith VS; all other lines shall start with HS. This is also true in the special case when \nVSA+VBP=0. Note that the position of synchronization packets, such as VS and HS, in time is \nof utmost importance since this has a direct impact on the visual perform ance of the display \npanel.  \nNormally, RGB pixel data is sent with one full scan line of pixels in a single packet. Individual \npixels shall not be split across packets.  \n  \n \nRFH70BA8 -AYH-MNG  \n \nPage 30 , Total 43 Pages  \nTransmission packet components used in the figures in this section are defined in Figure \nbelow unless otherwise specified.  \n \nDSI Video Mode Interface Timing Legend  \nIf a peripheral timing specification for HBP or HFP minimum period is zero, the corresponding \nBlanking Packet may be omitted. If the HBP or HFP maximum period is zero, the \ncorresponding blanking packet shall be omitted.  \nClock Requirements  \nA DSI host processor shall support continuous clock on the Clock Lane for display module \nthat require it, so the host processor needs to keep the HS serial clock running.  \n \n \n  \n\n \nRFH70BA8 -AYH-MNG  \n \nPage 31 , Total 43 Pages  \nNon-Burst Mode with Sync Pulses  \nWith this format, the goal is to accurately convey DPI -type timing over the DSI serial Link. \nThis includes matching DPI pixel -transmission rates, and widths of timing events like sync \npulses. Accordingly, synchronization pe riods are defined using packets transmitting both start \nand end of sync pulses. An example of this mode is shown in Figure below.  \n \nNormally, periods shown as I (Horizontal Sync Active), HBP (Horizontal Back Porch) and HFP \n(Horizontal Front Porch) are fill ed by Blanking Packets, with lengths (including packet \noverhead) calculated to match the period specified by the peripheral ’s data sheet. \nAlternatively, if there is sufficient time to transition from HS to LP mode and back again, a \ntimed interval in LP mod e may substitute for a Blanking Packet, thus saving power  \n  \n\n \nRFH70BA8 -AYH-MNG  \n \nPage 32 , Total 43 Pages  \n \nNon-Burst Mode with Sync Events  \nThis mode is a simplification of the format described in section “Non -Burst Mode with Sync \nPulse” .Only the start of each synchronization pulse is transmitted. T he peripheral may \nregenerate sync pulses as needed from each Sync Event packet received. Pixels are \ntransmitted at the same rate as they would in a corresponding parallel display interface such \nas DPI -2. An example of this mode is shown in Figure below.  \n \nAs with the previous Non -Burst Mode, if there is sufficient time to transition from HS to LP \nmode and back again, a timed interval in LP mode may substitute for a Blanking Packet, thus \nsaving power.  \n \n Burst Mode  \nIn this mode, blocks of pixel data can be transferred in a shorter time using a time -\ncompressed burst format. This is a good strategy to reduce overall DSI power consumption, \nas well as enabling larger blocks of time for other data transmissions over the Link in either \ndirection. There may be a li ne buffer or similar memory on the peripheral to accommodate \nincoming data at high speed. Following HS pixel data transmission, the bus goes to Low \nPower Mode, during which it may remain idle, i.e. the host processor remains in LP -11 state, \nor LP transmiss ion may take place in either direction. If the peripheral takes control of the bus \nfor sending data to the host processor, its transmission time shall be limited to ensure data \nunderflow does not occur from its internal buffer memory to the display device.  An example of \nthis mode is shown in Figure below  \n\n \nRFH70BA8 -AYH-MNG  \n \nPage 33 , Total 43 Pages  \n \nSimilar to the Non -Burst Mode scenario, if there is sufficient time to transition from HS to LP \nmode and back again, a timed interval in LP mode may substitute for a Blanking Packet, thus \nsaving power.  \n\n \nRFH70BA8 -AYH-MNG  \n \nPage 34 , Total 43 Pages  \n12.Optical Characteristics  \nItem Symbol  Condition.
