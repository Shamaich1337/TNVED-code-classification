It consists of a low noise \ndigital PFD (phase frequency detector), a precision charge pump , a \nprogrammable reference divider, programmable A and B counters , \nand a dual -modulus prescaler (P/P + 1). The A (6 -bit) and B \n(13-bit) counters, in conjunction with the dual -modulus prescaler  \n(P/P + 1), implement an N divider (N = BP + A). In addition, \nthe 14 -bit reference counter (R counter), allows selectable REF IN \nfrequencies at the PFD input. A complete phase- locked loop (PLL)  \ncan be implemented if the synthesizer is used with an external \nloop filter and voltage controlled oscillator (VCO). Its very high bandwidth means that frequency doublers can be eliminated in many high frequency systems, simplifying system architecture \nand re ducing cost.  \nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIA GRAM  \nCLK\nDATA\nLEREF IN\nRFINA\nRFINB24-BIT INPUT\nREGISTER\nSDOUTAVDD DVDD\nCE AGND DGND14-BIT\nR COUNTER\nR COUNTER\nLATCH\n2214\nFUNCTION\nLATCH\nA, B COUNTER\nLATCH FROM\nFUNCTION\nLATCH\nPRESCALER\nP/P + 1N = BP + A\nLOAD\nLOAD13-BIT\nB COUNTER\n6-BIT\nA COUNTER\n619\n13\nM3M2M1MUX\nSDOUTAVDDHIGH-Z\nMUXOUTCPGND RSET VP\nCPPHASE\nFREQUENCY\nDETECTOR\nLOCK\nDETECTREFERENCE\nCHARGE\nPUMP\nCURRENT\nSETTING 1\nADF4108CPI3 CPI2 CPI1 CPI6 CPI5 CPI4CURRENT\nSETTING 2\n06015-001 \nFigure 1. \nADF4108 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The prescaler value should be chosen to ensure that the RF inpu t is divided  down to a frequency that \nis less than this value.  \n4 AV DD = DV DD = 3.3 V.  \n5 AC coupling ensures AV DD/2 bias.  \n6 Guaranteed by design. Sample tested to ensure compliance.  \n7 TA = 25°C; AV DD = DV DD = 3.3 V; P = 32; RF IN = 8 GHz, f PFD = 200 k Hz, REF IN = 10 MHz.  \n8 TA = 25°C; AV DD = DV DD = 3.3 V; R = 16, 383; A = 63; B = 891; P = 32; RF IN = 7.0 GHz.  \n9 The synthesizer phase noise floor is estimated by measuring the in -band phase noise at the output of the VCO and subtracting 20 log N (where N is the N divider \nvalue)  and 10 log F PFD. PN SYNTH  = PN TOT − 10 log F PFD − 20 log N.  \n10 The PLL phase noise is composed of 1/f (flicker) noise plus the normalized PLL noise floor. The formula for calculating the 1 /f noise contribution at an RF frequency, f RF, \nand at a frequency offset, f, is given by PN = PN 1_f + 10 log(10 kHz/f) + 20 log(f RF/1 GHz). All phase noise measurements were performed with the EV -ADF4108EBZ1 and \nthe Agilent E5500 phase noise system. Both the normalized phase nois e floor and flicker noise are modeled in ADIsimPLL.  \n11 The phase noise is measured with the EV-ADF4108EB1Z  evaluation board, with the ZComm CRO8000Z VCO. The spectrum analyzer provides the REF IN for the \nsynthesiz er (f REFOUT  = 10 MHz @ 0 dBm).  \n12 fREFIN = 10 MHz; f PFD = 1 MH z; f RF = 7900 MHz; N = 7900; loop B/W = 30 kHz, VCO = ZComm CRO8000Z.  \nData Sheet ADF4108\n \nRev.

This is the ground return path for the charge pump. \n2, 3 AGND Analog Ground. This is the ground return path of the prescaler. \n4 RF INB Complementary Input to the RF Prescaler. This point must  be decoupled to the ground plane with a small bypass \ncapacitor, typically 100 pF. See Figure 11. \n5 RF INA Input to the RF Prescaler. This small signal input is ac-coupled to the external VCO. \n6, 7 AV DD Analog Power Supply. This voltage may range from 3.2 V to  3.6 V. Decoupling capacitors to the analog ground \nplane should be placed as close as possible to this pin. AV DD must be the same value as DV DD. \n8 REF IN Reference Input. This is a CMOS in put with a nominal threshold of V DD/2 and a dc equivalent input resistance of \n100 kΩ. See Figure 10. This input can be driven from a TT L or CMOS crystal oscillator or it can be ac-coupled. \n9, 10 DGND Digital Ground. \n11 CE Chip Enable. A logic low on this pin powers down the device and puts the charge pump output into three-state \nmode. Taking the pin high powers up the device, de pending on the status of the power-down bit, F2. \n12 CLK Serial Clock Input. This serial clock is used to clock in the serial data to the registers. The data is latched into the  \n24-bit shift register on the CLK rising edge. This input is a high impedance CMOS input. \n13 DATA Serial Data Input. The serial  data is loaded MSB first with the 2 LSBs being the control bits. This input is a high \nimpedance CMOS input. \n14 LE Load Enable, CMOS Input. When LE goes high, the data stored  in the shift registers is loaded into one of the four \nlatches, the latch being selected using the control bits. \n15 MUXOUT This multiplexer output allows either the lock detect, the scaled RF, or the scaled reference frequency to be \naccessed externally. \n16, 17 DV DD Digital Power Supply. This may range from 3.2 V to 3.6 V. Decoupling capacitors to the digital ground plane should \nbe placed as close as possible to this pin. DV DD must be the same value as AV DD. \n18 V P Charge Pump Power Supply. This voltage should be greater than or equal to V DD. In systems where V DD is 3.3 V, it \ncan be set to 5 V and used to drive a VCO with a tuning range of up to 5 V. \n19 R SET Connecting a resistor between this pin and CPGND sets the maximum charge pump output current.

RF Input Stage \nPRESCALER (P/P + 1) \nThe dual-modulus prescaler (P/P + 1), along with the A and B \ncounters, enables the large division ratio, N, to be realized (N = \nBP + A). The dual-modulus prescaler, operating at CML levels, \ntakes the clock from the RF input stage and divides it down to a \nmanageable frequency for the CMOS A and B counters. The prescaler is programmable. It can be set in software to 8/9, 16/17, 32/33, or 64/65. It is based on a synchronous 4/5 core. A minimum divide ratio is possible for contiguous output frequencies. This minimum is determined by P , the prescaler value, and is given by (P\n2 − P). \n \n \n  A AND B COUNTERS \nThe A and B CMOS counters combine with the dual-modulus \nprescaler to allow a wide ranging division ratio in the PLL \nfeedback counter. The counters are specified to work when the prescaler output is 300 MHz or less. Thus, with an RF input \nfrequency of 4.0 GHz, a prescaler value of 16/17 is valid but a \nvalue of 8/9 is not valid. \nPulse Swallow Function \nThe A and B counters, in conjunction with the dual-modulus \nprescaler, make it possible to generate output frequencies that \nare spaced only by the reference frequency divided by R. The equation for the VCO frequency is as follows: \n\uf028\uf029\uf05b\uf05d\nRfA B P fREFIN\nVCO \uf0b4 \uf02b \uf0b4 \uf03d  \nwhere: f\nVCO is the output frequency of external voltage controlled \noscillator (VCO). P is the preset modulus of dual-modulus prescaler (8/9, 16/17, \nand so on.). B is the preset divide ratio of binary 13-bit counter (3 to 8191). \nA is the preset divide ratio of binary 6-bit swallow counter  \n(0 to 63). f\nREFIN is the external reference frequency oscillator. \nLOAD\nLOADFROM RF\nINPUT STAGEPRESCALER\nP/P + 113-BIT B\nCOUNTERTO PFD\n6-BIT A\nCOUNTER\nN DIVIDERMODULUS\nCONTROLN = BP + A\n06015-018 \nFigure 12.

E | Page 10 of 20 PHASE FREQUENCY DETE CTOR AND  \nCHARGE PUMP  \nThe phase frequency detector (PFD) takes inputs from the R \ncounter and N counter (N = BP + A) and produces an output \nproportional to the phase and frequency difference between them. Figure 13 is a simplified schematic. The PFD includes a \nprogrammable delay element that controls the width of the antibacklash pulse. T his pulse ensures that there is no dead zone \nin the PFD transfer function and minimizes phase noise and reference spurs. Two bits in the reference counter latch, ABP2 \nand ABP1, control  the width of the pulse (s ee Figure 16). Use of  \nthe minimum antibacklash pulse width is not recommended.  \nHI\nHID1\nD2Q1\nQ2CLR2CPU1\nU2UP\nDOWNABP2 ABP1\nCPGNDU3R DIVIDER\nPROGRAMMABLE\nDELAY\nN DIVIDERVP\nCHARGE\nPUMP\nCLR1\n06015-019 \nFigure 13. PFD Simplified Schematic and Timing (in Lock)  \nMUXOUT AND LOCK DETE CT \nThe output multiplexer on the ADF4108  allows  the user to access  \nvarious internal points on the chip. The state of MUXOUT is \ncontrolled by M3, M2, and M1 in the function latch. Figure 18 \nshows the full truth table. Figure 14 shows the MUXOUT section  \nin block diagram form.  \nLock Detect  \nMUXOUT can be programmed for two types of lock detect: digital  \nlock detect and analog lock detect.  \nDigital lock detect is active high. When the lock detect precision  \n(LDP) bit in the R counter latch is set to 0, digital lock detect is \nset high when the phase error on three consecutive phase detector  \n(PD) cycles is less than 15 ns. With LDP set to 1, five consecutive \ncycles of less than 15 ns are required to set the lock detect. It stay s \nset high until a pha se error of greater than 25 ns is detected  on any \nsubsequent PD cycle.  The N -channel open- drain analog lock detect should be operated  \nwith an external pull -up resistor of 10 kΩ nominal. When lock \nhas been detected, this output is  high with narrow, low  going \npulses.  \nDGNDDVDD\nCONTROL MUXANALOG LOCK DETECT\nDIGITAL LOCK DETECT\nR COUNTER OUTPUT\nN COUNTER OUTPUT\nSDOUTMUXOUT\n06015-020 \nFigure 14. MUXOUT Circuit  \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER  \nThe ADF4108 digital se ction includes a 24 -bit input shift register , a \n14-bit R counter, and a 19 -bit N counter, comprising a 6 -bit A \ncounter and a 13 -bit B counter. Data is clocked into the 24 -bit \nshift register on each rising edge of CLK. The data is clocked in MSB first. Data  is transferred from the shift register to one of \nfour latches on the rising edge of LE. The destination latch is determined by the state of the two control bits (C2, C1) in the shift register. These are the 2 LSBs, DB1 and DB0, as shown in \nthe timing diag ram of Figure 2. The truth table for these bits is \nshown in Table 5. \nFigure 15 shows a summary of how the latches are programmed . \nTable 5.

Initialization Latch Map  \n \nADF4108  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 16 of 20 FUNCTION LATCH  \nThe on -chip function latch is programmed with C2 and C1 set \nto 1 and 0, respectively. Figure 18 shows the input data format \nfor programmin g the function latch.  \nCounter Reset  \nDB2 (F1) is the counter reset bit. When this bit is 1, the R counter  \nand the AB counters are reset. For normal operation, this bit \nshould be 0. Upon powering up, the F1 bit needs to be disabled \n(set to 0). Then, the N co unter resumes counting in close alignment  \nwith the R counter. (The maximum error is one prescaler cycle.)  \nPower -Down  \nDB3 (PD1) and DB21 (PD2) provide programmable power -down  \nmodes. They are enabled by the CE pin.  \nWhen the CE pin is low, the device is immed iately disabled \nregardless of the states of PD2 and PD1. \nIn the programmed asynchronous power -down, the device \npowers down immediately after latching a 1 into the PD1 bit, \nwith the condition that PD2 has been loaded with a 0.  \nIn the programmed synchronous power -down, the device \npower -down is gated by the charge pump to prevent unwanted \nfrequency jumps. Once the power -down is enabled by writing a 1  \ninto PD1 (on condition that a 1 has also been loaded to PD2), \nthe device go es into power -down on the occurrence  of the next \ncharge pump event.  \nWhen a power -down is activated (either synchronous or \nasynchronous mode, including CE pin activated power -down), \nthe following events occur:  \n• All active dc current paths are removed.  \n• The R, N, and timeout counters are forced to their load \nstate conditions.  \n• The charge pump is forced into three -state mode.  \n• The digital lock detect circuitry is reset.  \n• The RFIN input is debiased.  \n• The reference input buffer circuitry is disabled.  \n• The input register remains active and capable of load ing \nand latching data.  \nMUXOUT Control  \nThe on -chip multiplexer is controlled by M3, M2, and M1 on \nthe ADF4108. Figure 18 shows the truth table.  \nFastlock Enable Bit  \nDB9 of the function l atch is the fastlock enable bit. Fastlock is \nenabled only when this bit is 1.  \nFastlock Mode Bit  \nDB10 of the function latch is the fastlock mode bit. When fastlock \nis enabled, this bit determines which fastlock mode is used. If the fastlock mode bit is 0, t hen Fastlock Mode 1 is selected; and \nif the fastlock mode bit is 1, then Fastlock Mode 2 is selected.  Fastlock Mode 1  \nThe charge pump current is switched to the contents of Current \nSetting 2.  \nThe device enters fastlock by having a 1 written to the CP gain  \nbit in the AB counter latch. The device exits fastlock by having a \n0 written to the CP gain bit in the AB counter latch.  \nFastlock Mode 2  \nThe charge pump current is switched to the contents of Current \nSetting 2.  \nThe device enters fastlock by having a 1 wr itten to the CP gain \nbit in the AB counter latch. The device exits fastlock under the \ncontrol of the timer counter. After the timeout period determined  \nby the value in TC4:TC1, the CP gain bit in the AB counter \nlatch is automatically reset to 0 and the dev ice reverts to normal \nmode instead of fastlock. See Figure 18 for the timeout periods.  \nTimer Counter Control  \nThe user has the option of programming two charge pump currents. The intent is that Current Setting 1 is used when the RF output is stable and the system is in a static state. Current \nSetting 2 is meant to be used when the system is dynamic and \nin a state of change (that is, when a new output frequency is \nprogrammed).  \nThe normal sequence of events is as follows:  \nThe user initially decides what the preferred charge pump currents  \nare going to be. For example, the choice may be 2.5 mA as \nCurrent Setting 1 and 5 mA as Current Setting 2.  \nAt the same time , it must be decided how long the secondary \ncurrent is to stay active before reverting to the primary current. This is controlled by the timer counter control bits, DB14:DB11 (TC4:TC1) in the function latch. The truth table is given in \nFigure 18. \nNow, to program a new output frequency, the user simply \nprogra ms the AB counter latch with new values for A and B. \nAt the same time, the CP gain bit can be set to 1, which sets the \ncharge pump with the value in CPI6:CPI4 for a period of time \ndetermined by TC4 :TC1. When this time is up, the charge pump  \ncurrent reverts  to the value set by CPI3:CPI1. At the same time, \nthe CP gain bit in the AB counter latch is reset to 0 and is now \nready for the next time the user wishes to change the frequency.  \nNote that there is an enable feature on the timer counter. It is enabled wh en Fastlock Mode 2 is chosen by setting the fastlock \nmode bit (DB10) in the function latch to 1.  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  ADF4108  \n \nRev. E | Page 17 of 20 Charge Pump Currents  \nCPI3, CPI2, and CPI1 program Current Setting 1 for the charge \npump. CPI6, CPI5, and CPI4 program Current Setting 2 for the charge pump.  The truth table is given in Figure 18. \nPrescaler Value  \nP2 and P1 in the function latch set the prescaler values. The prescaler value should be chosen so that the prescaler output frequency is always less than or equal to 300 MHz. Thus, with an RF frequency of 4 GHz, a prescaler value of 16/17 is valid but a value of 8/9 is not valid.  \nPD Polarity  \nThis bit sets the phase detector polarity bit. See Figure 18. \nCP Three -State  \nThis bit controls the CP output pin.  With the bit set high, the \nCP output is put into three -state. With the bit set low, the CP \noutput is enabled.  \nINITIALIZATION LATCH  \nThe initialization latch is programmed when C2 and C1 are set to 1 and 1. This is essentially the same as the function latch  \n(programmed when C2, C1 = 1, 0).  \nHowever, when the initialization latch is programmed, an \nadditional internal reset pulse is applied to the R and AB counters . \nThis pulse ensures that the AB counter is at load point when the \nAB counter data is latched and the device will begin counting in close phase alignment.  \nIf the latch is programmed for synchronous power -down (CE \npin is high; PD1 bit is high; PD2 bit is low), the internal pulse also triggers this power -down. The prescaler reference and the \noscillator i nput buffer are unaffected by the internal reset pulse \nand so close phase alignment is maintained when counting resumes.  \nWhen the first AB counter data is latched after initialization, the internal reset pulse is again activated. However, successive AB counter loads after this do  not trigger the internal reset pulse.  \nDevice Programming After Initial Power -Up \nAfter initially powering up the device, there are three ways to program the device.  \nInitialization Latch Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Program the initialization l atch (11 in 2 LSBs of input \nword). Make sure that the F1 bit is programmed to 0.  \n3. Next, do a function latch load (10 in 2 LSBs of the control \nword), making sure that the F1 bit is programmed to a 0.  \n4. Then do an R load (00 in 2 LSBs).  \n5. Then do an AB load (0 1 in 2 LSBs).  \n \n When the initialization latch is loaded, the following occurs:  \n1. The function latch contents are loaded.  \n2. An internal pulse resets the R, AB, and timeout counters to \nload  state conditions and also three -states the charge pump. \nNote that the pr escaler b and gap reference and the oscillator  \ninput buffer are unaffected by the internal reset pulse, \nallowing close phase alignment when counting resumes. \n3. Latching the first AB counter data after the initialization word activate s the same internal reset pulse. Successive AB \nloads do not trigger the internal reset pulse unless there is \nanother initialization.  \nCE Pin Method  \n1. Apply VDD.  \n2. Bring CE low to put the device into power -down. This is an \nasynchronous power -down in that it happens immediately.  \n3. Program t he function latch (10).  \n4. Program the R counter latch (00).  \n5. Program the AB counter latch (01).  \n6. Bring CE high to take the device out of power -down. The R \nand AB counters will now resume counting in close alignment.  \nNote that after  CE goes high, a duration of 1 μ s may be required \nfor the prescaler band gap voltage and oscillator input buffer bias to reach steady state.  \nCE can be used to power the device up and down to check for \nchannel activity. The input register does not need to be repro -\ngrammed each time the  device is disabled and enabled as long \nas it has been programmed at least once after V\nDD was initially \napplied.  \nCounter Reset Method  \n1. Apply V DD. \n2. Do a function latch load (10 in 2 LSBs). As part of this, load 1 to the F1 bit. This enables the counter reset . \n3. Do an R counter load (00 in 2 LSBs).  \n4. Do an AB counter load (01 in 2 LSBs).  \n5. Do a function latch load (10 in 2 LSBs). As part of this, \nload 0 to the F1 bit. This disables the counter reset.  \nThis sequence provides the same close alignment as the \ninitializat ion method. It offers direct control over the internal \nreset. Note that counter reset holds the counters at load point and three -states the charge pump, but does not trigger \nsynchronous power -down.  \nPOWER SUPPLY CONSIDE RATIONS  \nThe ADF4108 operates over a power supply range of 3.2  V to \n3.6 V.  T h e  ADP3300ART -3.3 is a low dropout linear regulator \nfrom Analog Devices , Inc . It outputs 3.3  V with an accuracy of \n1.4% and i s recommended for use with the ADF4108. \n \nADF4108  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. E | Page 18 of 20 INTERFACING \nThe ADF4108 has a simple SPI -compatible serial interface for \nwriting to the device. CLK, DATA, and LE contr ol the data transfer . \nWhen LE ( latch enable) goes high, the 24 bits that have been \nclocked into the input register on each rising edge of CLK are \ntransferred to the appropriate latch. See Figure 2 for the timing \ndiagram and Table 5 for the latch truth table.  \nThe maximum allowable serial clock rate is 20 MHz. This means \nthat the maximum update rate possible for the device is 833 kHz  or \none update every 1.2 µs. This is certainly more than adequate for  \nsystems that have typical lock times in hundreds of microseconds.  \nADUC812  INTERFACE  \nFigure 20 shows the interface between the ADF4108 and the \nADuC812 MicroConverter®. Because  the ADuC812 is based \non an 8051 core, this interface can be used with any 8051- based  \nmicrocontroller. The MicroConverter is set up for SPI master \nmode with CPHA = 0. To initiate the operation, the I/O port driving LE is brought low. Each latch of the ADF4108 needs a \n24-bit word. This is accomplished by writing three 8 -bit bytes \nfrom the M icroConverter to the device. When the third byte \nhas been written, the LE input should be brought high to complete the transfer.  \nOn first applying power to the ADF4108, it needs four writes (one each to the in itialization latch, function latch, R counter \nlatch, and N counter latch) for the output to become active.  \nI/O port lines on the ADuC812 are also used to control power -\ndown (CE input) and to detect lock (MUXOU T configured as \nlock detect and polled by the port input).  \nWhen operating in the mode described, the maximum SCLOCK  \nrate of the ADuC812 is 4 MHz. This means that the maximum \nrate at which the output frequency can be changed is  166 kHz.  CLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nADF4108SCLOCK\nI/O PORTSADuC812\n06015-026 \nFigure 20.

The ADF4108  needs a 24 -bit \nserial word for each latch write. The easiest way to accomplish this using the ADSP -21xx family is to use the autobuffered transmit  \nmode of operation with alternate framing. This provides a means for transmitting an entire block of serial data before an interrupt  is \ngenerated. Set up the word length for 8 bits and use three memory  \nlocations for each 24 -bit word. To program each 24 -bit latch, \nstore the three 8 -bit bytes, enable the autobuffered mode, and \nthen write to the transmit register of the DSP . This last operation  \ninitiates the autobuffer transfer.  \nCLK\nDATA\nLE\nCE\nMUXOUT\n(LOCK DETECT)MOSI\nADF4108SCLOCK\nI/O FLAGSADSP-21xxTFS\n06015-027 \nFigure 21.

The land should be centered on the pad. This ensure s \nthat the solder joint size is maximized.

On the printed circuit board, there \nshould be a clearance of at least 0.25 mm between the thermal pad and the inner edges of the pad pattern. This ensures that \nshor ting is avoided.  Thermal vias can be used on the printed circuit board thermal \npad to improve thermal performance of the package. If vias are \nused, they should be incorporated in the thermal pad at 1.2 mm pitch grid. The via diameter should be between 0.3  mm and \n0.33 mm and the via barrel should be plated with 1 oz. copper to plug the via.  \nThe user should connect the printed circuit board thermal pad to AGND.  \n \nADF4108 Data Sheet\n \nRev.
