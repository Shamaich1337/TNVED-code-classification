Operation beyond the maximum operat-\ning conditions for extended periods may affect product reliability.\nTHERMAL DATA\nAbsolute maximum ratings apply individually only, not in combina-\ntion. The ADP150  can be damaged when the junction temperature\nlimits are exceeded. Monitoring ambient temperature does not\nguarantee that TJ is within the specified temperature limits. In appli-\ncations with high power dissipation and poor thermal resistance, the\nmaximum ambient temperature may have to be derated.\nIn applications with moderate power dissipation and low printed\ncircuit board (PCB) thermal resistance, the maximum ambient tem-\nperature can exceed the maximum limit as long as the junction\ntemperature is within specification limits. The junction temperature\n(TJ) of the device is dependent on the ambient temperature (TA),\nthe power dissipation of the device (PD), and the junction-to-ambi-\nent thermal resistance of the package ( θJA).\nMaximum junction temperature (TJ) is calculated from the ambient\ntemperature (TA) and power dissipation (PD) by\nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA)\nThe junction to ambient thermal resistance ( θJA) of the package is\nbased on modeling and a calculation using a 4-layer board. The\njunction to ambient thermal resistance is highly dependent on the\napplication and board layout. In applications where high maximumpower dissipation exists, close attention to thermal board design is\nrequired. The value of θJA can vary, depending on PCB material,\nlayout, and environmental conditions. The specified values of θJA\nare based on a 4-layer, 4 inch × 3 inch circuit board.

ΨJB of the package is based on modeling and\na calculation using a 4-layer board.

ΨJB measures the component power flowing through\nmultiple thermal paths rather than a single path as in thermal\nresistance, θJB. Therefore, ΨJB thermal paths include convection\nfrom the top of the package as well as radiation from the pack-\nage, factors that make ΨJB more useful in real-world applications.\nMaximum junction temperature (TJ) is calculated from the board\ntemperature (TB) and power dissipation (PD) by\nTJ = TB + (PD × ΨJB)\nRefer to JESD51-8 and JESD51-12 for more detailed information\nabout ΨJB.\nTHERMAL RESISTANCE\nθJA and ΨJB are specified for the worst-case conditions, that is, a\ndevice soldered in a circuit board for surface-mount packages.\nTable 4.

E | 11 of 20The ADP150  is an ultralow noise, low quiescent current, low\ndropout linear regulator that operates from 2.2 V to 5.5 V and\ncan provide up to 150 mA of output current. Drawing a low 220\nµA of quiescent current (typical) at full load makes the ADP150\nideal for battery-operated portable equipment. Shutdown current\nconsumption is typically 200 nA.\nUsing a proprietary architecture, the ADP150  provides superior\nnoise performance for noise sensitive analog and RF applications\nwithout the need for a noise bypass capacitor. The ADP150  is also\noptimized for use with small 1 µF ceramic capacitors.\nFigure 26. Internal Block DiagramInternally, the ADP150  consists of a reference, an error amplifier,\na feedback voltage divider, and a PMOS pass transistor. Output\ncurrent is delivered via the PMOS pass device that is controlled\nby the error amplifier. The error amplifier compares the reference\nvoltage with the feedback voltage from the output and amplifies\nthe difference. If the feedback voltage is lower than the reference\nvoltage, the gate of the PMOS device is pulled lower, allowing\nmore current to pass and increasing the output voltage. If the\nfeedback voltage is higher than the reference voltage, the gate of\nthe PMOS device is pulled higher, allowing less current to pass and\ndecreasing the output voltage.\nThe ADP150  is available in 14 output voltage options, ranging from\n1.8 V to 3.3 V. The ADP150  uses the EN pin to enable and disable\nthe VOUT pin under normal operating conditions. When EN is high,\nVOUT turns on, and when EN is low, VOUT turns off. For automatic\nstartup, EN can be tied to VIN.\nData Sheet ADP150\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 12 of 20CAPACITOR SELECTION\nOutput Capacitor\nThe ADP150  is designed for operation with small, space-saving\nceramic capacitors but functions with most commonly used capaci-\ntors as long as care is taken with regard to the effective series\nresistance (ESR) value. The ESR of the output capacitor affects the\nstability of the LDO control loop. A minimum of 1 µF capacitance\nwith an ESR of 1 Ω or less is recommended to ensure the stability\nof the ADP150 . The transient response to changes in load current\nis also affected by output capacitance. Using a larger value of\noutput capacitance improves the transient response of the ADP150\nto large changes in the load current. Figure 27  and Figure 28  show\nthe transient responses for output capacitance values of 1 µF and\n4.7 µF, respectively.\nFigure 27. Output Transient Response, COUT = 1 µF\nFigure 28. Output Transient Response, COUT = 4.7 µF\nInput Bypass Capacitor\nConnecting a 1 µF capacitor from VIN to GND reduces the circuit\nsensitivity to the PCB layout, especially when long input traces\nor high source impedance is encountered. If greater than 1 µFof output capacitance is required, increase the input capacitor to\nmatch the output capacitor.\nInput and Output Capacitor Properties\nAny good quality ceramic capacitors can be used with the ADP150 ,\nas long as they meet the minimum capacitance and maximum\nESR requirements. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a\nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior over temperature\nand applied voltage. Capacitors must have a dielectric adequate to\nensure the minimum capacitance over the necessary temperature\nrange and dc bias conditions. X5R or X7R dielectrics with a voltage\nrating of 6.3 V or 10 V are recommended. Y5V and Z5U dielectrics\nare not recommended, due to their poor temperature and dc bias\ncharacteristics.\nFigure 29  depicts the capacitance vs. the voltage bias characteristic\nof a 0402, 1 µF, 10 V, X5R capacitor. The voltage stability of a\ncapacitor is strongly influenced by the capacitor size and voltage\nrating. In general, a capacitor in a larger package or higher voltage\nrating exhibits better stability. The temperature variation of the X5R\ndielectric is about ±15% over the −40°C to +85°C temperature\nrange and is not a function of package or voltage rating.\nFigure 29. Capacitance vs. Voltage Bias Characteristic\nUse Equation 1  to determine the worst-case capacitance, account-\ning for capacitor variation over temperature, component tolerance,\nand voltage.\nCEFF = CBIAS × (1 − TEMPCO ) × (1 − TOL) (1)\nwhere:\nCBIAS is the effective capacitance at the operating voltage.\nTEMPCO  is the worst-case capacitor temperature coefficient.\nTOL is the worst-case component tolerance.\nIn this example, the worst-case temperature coefficient (TEMPCO)\nover −40°C to +85°C is assumed to be 15% for an X5R dielectric.\nThe tolerance of the capacitor (TOL) is assumed to be 10%, and\nthe CBIAS is 0.94 µF at 1.8 V, as shown in Figure 29 .\nSubstituting these values in Equation 1  yields\nData Sheet ADP150\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 13 of 20CEFF = 0.94 µF × (1 − 0.15) × (1 − 0.1) = 0.719 µF\nTherefore, the capacitor chosen in this example meets the mini-\nmum capacitance requirement of the LDO over temperature and\ntolerance at the chosen output voltage.\nTo guarantee the performance of the ADP150 , it is imperative that\nthe effects of the dc bias, temperature, and tolerances on the\nbehavior of the capacitors be evaluated for each.\nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT\nThe ADP150  has an internal undervoltage lockout circuit that disa-\nbles all inputs and the output when the input voltage is less than\napproximately 2.0 V. This ensures that the ADP150  inputs and\noutput behave in a predictable manner during power-up.\nENABLE FEATURE\nThe ADP150  uses the EN pin to enable and disable the VOUT pin\nunder normal operating conditions. As shown in Figure 30 , when a\nrising voltage on EN crosses the active threshold, VOUT turns on.\nWhen a falling voltage on EN crosses the inactive threshold, VOUT\nturns off.\nFigure 30. Typical EN Pin Operation\nAs shown in Figure 30 , the EN pin has hysteresis built in. This\nprevents on/off oscillations that can occur due to noise on the EN\npin as it passes through the threshold points.\nThe EN pin active/inactive thresholds are derived from the VIN volt-\nage; therefore, these thresholds vary with changing input voltage.\nFigure 31  shows the typical EN active/inactive thresholds when the\ninput voltage varies from 2.2 V to 5.5 V.Figure 31. Typical EN Pin Thresholds vs. Input Voltage (VIN)\nThe ADP150  uses an internal soft start to limit the inrush current\nwhen the output is enabled. The start-up time for the 3.3 V option\nis approximately 150 µs from the time the EN active threshold is\ncrossed to when the output reaches 90% of its final value. As\nshown in Figure 32 , the start-up time is dependent on the output\nvoltage setting.\nFigure 32. Typical Start-Up Time\nCURRENT LIMIT AND THERMAL OVERLOAD\nPROTECTION\nThe ADP150  is protected against damage due to excessive power\ndissipation by current and thermal overload protection circuits. The\nADP150  is designed to limit current when the output load reaches\n260 mA (typical). When the output load exceeds 260 mA, the output\nvoltage is reduced to maintain a constant current limit.\nThermal overload protection is included, which limits the junction\ntemperature to a maximum of 150°C (typical). Under extreme\nconditions (that is, high ambient temperature and power dissipation)\nwhen the junction temperature starts to rise above 150°C, the\noutput is turned off, reducing the output current to zero. When the\njunction temperature drops below 135°C, the output is turned on\nagain and the output current is restored to its nominal value.\nData Sheet ADP150\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nanalog.com Rev. E | 14 of 20Consider the case where a hard short from VOUT to GND occurs.\nAt first, the ADP150  limits current so that only 260 mA is conducted\ninto the short. If self-heating of the junction is great enough to\ncause its temperature to rise above 150°C, thermal shutdown\nactivates, turning off the output and reducing the output current to\nzero. As the junction temperature cools and drops below 135°C,\nthe output turns on and conducts 260 mA into the short, again\ncausing the junction temperature to rise above 150°C. This thermal\noscillation between 135°C and 150°C causes a current oscillation\nbetween 260 mA and 0 mA that continues as long as the short\nremains at the output.\nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect the de-\nvice against accidental overload conditions. For reliable operation,\ndevice power dissipation must be externally limited so that the\njunction temperatures do not exceed 125°C.\nTHERMAL CONSIDERATIONS\nIn most applications, the ADP150  does not dissipate much heat\ndue to its high efficiency. However, in applications with high ambient\ntemperature and high supply voltage to output voltage differential,\nthe heat dissipated in the package is large enough that it can cause\nthe junction temperature of the die to exceed the maximum junction\ntemperature of 125°C.\nWhen the junction temperature exceeds 150°C, the converter en-\nters thermal shutdown. It recovers only after the junction tempera-\nture decreases below 135°C to prevent any permanent damage.\nTherefore, thermal analysis for the chosen application is very\nimportant to guarantee reliable performance over all conditions.\nThe junction temperature of the die is the sum of the ambient\ntemperature of the environment and the temperature rise of the\npackage due to the power dissipation, as shown in Equation 2 .\nTo guarantee reliable operation, the junction temperature of the\nADP150  must not exceed 125°C. To ensure that the junction\ntemperature stays below 125°C, be aware of the parameters that\ncontribute to the junction temperature changes. These parameters\ninclude ambient temperature, power dissipation in the power de-\nvice, and thermal resistances between the junction and ambient\nair (θJA). The θJA number is dependent on the package assembly\ncompounds that are used and the amount of copper used to solder\nthe package GND pins to the PCB. Table 7  shows typical θJA\nvalues of the 5-lead TSOT and 4-ball WLCSP packages for various\nPCB copper sizes. Table 8  shows the typical ΨJB value of the\n5-lead TSOT and 4-ball WLCSP.\nTable 7.

Typical ΨJB Values\nΨJB (°C/W)\nTSOT WLCSP\n42.8 58.4\nUse Equation 2  to calculate the junction temperature.\nTJ = TA + (PD × θJA) (2)\nwhere:\nTA is the ambient temperature.\nPD is the power dissipation in the die, given by\nPD = ((VIN − VOUT) × ILOAD) + (VIN × IGND)\nwhere:\nILOAD is the load current.\nIGND is the ground current.\nVIN and VOUT are input and output voltages, respectively.\nPower dissipation due to ground current is quite small and can be\nignored. Therefore, the junction temperature equation simplifies to\nTJ = TA + (((VIN − VOUT) × ILOAD) × θJA) (3)\nAs shown in the previous equation, for a given ambient temper-\nature, input-to-output voltage differential, and continuous load cur-\nrent, there exists a minimum copper size requirement for the PCB\nto ensure that the junction temperature does not rise above 125°C.\nFigure 33  to Figure 46  show the junction temperature calculations\nfor the different ambient temperatures, load currents, VIN-to-VOUT\ndifferentials, and areas of PCB copper.\nFigure 33.

However,\nas listed in Table 7 , a point of diminishing returns is reached\neventually, beyond which an increase in the copper size does not\nyield significant heat dissipation benefits.\nPlace the input capacitor as close as possible to the VIN and\nGND pins. Place the output capacitor as close as possible to the\nVOUT and GND pins. Use of 0402 size or 0603 size capacitors and\nresistors achieves the smallest possible footprint solution on boards\nwhere area is limited.\nFigure 47. Example TSOT PCB Layout\nFigure 48.
