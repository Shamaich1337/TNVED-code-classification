The parts operate from a single 2.7 V to 5.25 V \npower supply and feature throughput rates up to 1 MSPS. The \nparts contain  a low noise, wide bandwidth track -and-hold  \namplifier that can handle input frequencies in excess of 8 MHz.  \nThe conversion process and data acquisition are controlled using  \nCS and the serial clock signal, allowing the device to easily inter -\nface with microprocessors or DSPs. The input signal is sampled \non the falling edge of CS and conversion is  initiated at this \npoint. There are no pipeline delays associa ted with the part.  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 use advanced design techniques to achieve very low power dissipation at maximum throughput rates. At maximum throughput rates, the AD7904/AD7914/  \nAD7924 consume 2 mA maximum with 3 V supplies; with 5 V supplies, the current consumption is 2.7 mA maximum.  \nThrough the configuration of the control register , the analog \ninput range for the part can be selected as 0 V to REF\nIN or 0 V to \n2 × REF IN, with either straight binary or twos complement output  \ncoding. Th e AD7904/ AD7914/AD7924 each feature four single -\nended analog inputs with a channel sequencer to allow a pre -\nprogrammed selection of channels to be converted sequentially.  \nThe conversion time for the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 is \ndetermined  by the SCLK frequency, which is also used as the \nmaster clock to control the conversion.  PRODUCT  HIGHLIGHTS  \n1. High Throughput with Low Power Consumption.  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 offer throughput rates  \nup to 1 MSPS. At the  maximum throughput rate with 3 V \nsupplies, the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 dissipate only   \n6 mW of power maximum.  \n2. Four Single -Ended Inputs with Channel Sequencer.  \nA consecutive sequence of channels can be selected, \nthrough which the ADC will cycle and convert on.  \n3. Single -Supply Operation with V DRIVE  Function.  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 operate from a single 2.7 V to 5.25 V supply. The V\nDRIVE function allows the serial inter -\nface to connect  directly to 3 V or 5 V processor systems , \nindependent of V DD. \n4. Flexible Power/Serial Clock Speed Management.  The conversion rate is determin ed by the serial clock, \nallowing the conversion time to be reduced by increasing  \nthe serial clock speed. The parts also feature two  shutdown \nmodes to maximize power efficiency at lower throughput \nrates. Current consumption is 0.5 µ A max imum when in \nfull sh utdown.  \n5. No Pipeline Delay.  The part s feature a standard successive approximation \nADC with accurate control of the s ampling instant via  \nthe \nCS input and once -off conversion control.  \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Data to be writ ten to the c ontrol register of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 is provided on \nthis input and is clocked into the register on the falling edge of SCLK (see the Control  Register section).  \n3 CS Chip Select. Active low logic input. This input provides the dual function of initiating conversions on the \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 and  frames the serial data transfer.  \n4, 8, 13, 16  AGND  Analog Grou nd. Ground reference point for all analog circuitry on the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924. All analog \ninput signals and any external reference signal should be referred to this AGND voltage. All AGND pins should \nbe connected together.  \n5, 6 AV DD Analog Power Supply  Input. The AV DD range for the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 is from 2.7 V to 5.25 V. For the 0 V \nto 2 × REF IN range, AV DD should be from 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n7 REF IN Reference Input for the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924. An external reference must be applied to this input.

The four  single -ended analog input channels are multiplexed into the \non-chip track -and -hold.  The analog input channel to be converted is selected using the address bits ADD1 and \nADD0 of the control register. The address bits, in conjunction with the SEQ1 and SEQ0 bits, allow the s equencer \nto be programmed. The input range for all input channels c an extend from 0 V to REF IN or from 0 V to 2 × REF IN \nas selected via the RANGE bit in the control register. Any unused input channels should be connected to AGND \nto avoid noise pickup.  \n14 DOUT  Data Ou t, Logic Output.

C | Page 14 of 32 TERMINOLOGY  \nIntegral Nonlinearity  (INL)  \nINL is the maximum deviation from a straight line passing through  \nthe endpoints of the ADC transfer function. The endpoints of the  \ntransfer function are zero scale, a point 1 LSB below the first code  \ntransition, and full s cale, a point 1 LSB above the last code transition.  \nDifferential Nonlinearity  (DNL)  \nDNL  is the difference between the measured and the ideal \n1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes in the ADC.  \nOffset Erro r \nOffset error is the deviation o f the first co de transition (00 … 000 \nto 00 … 001) from the ideal , that is , AGND + 1 LSB.  \nOffset Error Match  \nOffset error match is the difference in offset error between any \ntwo channels.  \nGain Error  \nGain error is the deviation of the last code transiti on (111 … 110 \nto 111 …  111) from the ideal , that is , REF IN − 1 LSB, after the \noffset error has been adjusted out.  \nGain Error Match  \nGain error match is the  difference in gain error between any \ntwo channels.   \nZero Code Error  \nZero code error is the deviation of the midscale tr ansition (all \n0s to all 1s) from the ideal V IN voltage, that is , REF IN − 1 LSB.  It \napplies when using the twos complement output coding option  \nwith  the 2 ×  REF IN input range (−REF IN to +REF IN biased about \nthe REF IN point ). \nZero Code Error Match  \nZero code error match is the difference in z ero code error \nbetween any two channels.  \nPositive Gain Error  \nPositive gain error  is the deviation of the last code transition \n(011 … 110 to 011 … 111) from the ideal , that is , +REF IN − 1 LSB , \nafter the z ero code error is adjusted out.  It applies when using \nthe twos complement output coding option  with  the 2 ×  REF IN \ninput range (− REF IN to +REF IN biased about the REF IN point ). \nPositive Gain Error Match  \nPositive gain error  match is the difference in p ositive gain error \nbetween any two channels.  \nNegative Gain Error  \nNegative g ain error is the deviation of the  first code transition \n(100 … 000 to 100 … 001) from the ideal , that is, −REF IN + 1 LSB , \nafter the z ero code error is adjusted out.  It applies when using \nthe twos complement o utput coding option  with  the 2 ×  REF IN \ninput range (− REF IN to +REF IN biased about the REF IN point ). \nNegative Gain Error Match  \nNegative g ain error match is the difference in n egative gain \nerror between any two channels.  Channel -to-Channel Isolation  \nChannel -to-channel isolation is a measure of the level of cross-\ntalk between channels. It is measured by applying a full -scale \n400 kHz sine wave signal to all three nonselected input channels \nand determining how much that signal is attenuated in the \nselected chann el with a 50 kHz signal. The figure is given worst \ncase across all four channels for the AD7904/AD7914/ AD7924.  \nPower Supply Rejection  (PSR ) \nVariations in power supply affect the full -scale transition but not \nthe linearity  of the converter . PSR is the maxim um change in \nthe full-scale transition point due to a change in power supply \nvoltage from the nominal value  (see Figure 6). \nPower Supply Rejection  Ratio (PSRR)  \nPSRR is the ratio of the power in the ADC output at full -scale \nfrequen cy, f, to the power of a 200 mV p -p sine wave applied to \nthe ADC AV DD supply of frequency f S. \nPSRR( dB) = 10 log(Pf/Pfs)  \nwhere:  \nPf is the powe r at frequency f  in the ADC output.  \nPfS is the power at frequency fS coupled onto the ADC AV DD supply . \nTrack -and-Hold Acquisition Time  \nThe track -and-hold amplifier returns to track mode at the end \nof a conversion. Track -and-hold acquisition time is the time \nrequired for the output of the track -and-hold amplifier to reach \nits final value, within ±1 LSB, after the end of  a conversion.  \nSignal to (Noise + Distortion) (SINAD) Ratio  \nSINAD  is the measured ratio of signal to (noise + distortion) at \nthe output of the ADC . The signal is the rms amplitude of the \nfundamental. Noise is the sum of all nonfundamental signals up to hal f the sampling frequency (f\nS/2), excluding dc. The ratio is \ndependent on the number of quantization levels in the digitiza -\ntion process : the more levels, the smaller the quantization noise. \nThe theoretical SINAD  ratio for an ideal N -bit converter with  a \nsine wave input is given by  \nSignal to  (Noise  + Distortion)  = (6.02 N +1.76)  dB \nThus , for a 12 -bit converter, SINAD  is 74 dB, for a 10- bit \nconverter , it is 62 dB, and for an 8 -bit converter, it is 50 dB.  \nTotal Harmonic Distortion  (THD) \nTHD  is the ratio of the  rms sum of harmonics to the funda -\nmental. For the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924, it is  defined as  \n12\n62\n52\n42\n32\n2log20 (dB)VV V V V V\nTHD++++\n=  \nwhere:  \nV1 is the rms amplitude  of the fundamental.  \nV2, V3, V4, V5, and V6 are the rms amplitudes of the second \nthrough the sixth harmonics.  \n \nData Sheet  AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 \n \nRev. C | Page 15 of 32 CONTROL  REGISTER \nThe control register  of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 is a  \n12-bit, write -only register. Data is loaded from the DIN pin of \nthe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 on the falling edge of SCLK. The \ndata is transferred on the DIN line at the same time that the  \nconversion result is read from the part. The data transferred on the DIN line corresponds to the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 configuration for the next conversion. This requires 16 serial \nclocks for every data transfer. Only the information provided  \non the firs t 12 falling clock edges (after  the \nCS falling edge) is loaded to the control register . MSB denotes the first bit in the \ndata stream. The bit functions are outlined in Table 8. \nTable 7. Channel Selection  \nADD1  ADD0  Analog Input Channel  \n0 0 VIN0 \n0 1 VIN1 \n1 0 VIN2 \n1 1 VIN3 \n \nTable 8.

If this bit \nis set to 1, the following 11 bits will be written to the control register; if this bit  is set to 0, the remaining 11 bits are not  \nloaded to the control register, which  remains unchanged.  \n10 SEQ1  The SEQ1 bit is used in conjunction with the SEQ0 bit to control the use of the sequencer function  (see Table 10). \n[9:8] DONTC  Don’t care bits.  \n[7:6]  ADD1, \nADD0  The two address bits are loaded at the end of the present conversion sequence and select which analog input \nchannel is to be converted in the next serial transfer, or they may select the final channel in a consec utive sequence \nas described in Table 10. The selected input channel is decoded as shown in Table 7. The address bits corresponding \nto the conversion result are also output on DOUT prior to the 12 bits of data  (see the Serial Interface section ). The next \nchannel to be converted on will be selected by the mux on the 14th  SCLK falling edge.  \n[5:4]  PM1, PM0  The two p ower management bits decode the mode of operation of the AD7904/AD79 14/AD7924 as described in \nTable 9. \n3 SEQ0  The SEQ0 bit is used in conjunction with the SEQ1 bit to control the use of the sequencer function  (see Table 10). \n2 DONTC  Don’t care bit.  \n1 RANGE  This bit selects the analog input range to be used on the AD7904/A D7914/AD7924. If it is set to 0, the analog input \nrange will extend from 0 V to 2 × REF IN. If it is set to 1, the analog input range will extend from 0 V to REF IN (for the next \nconversion). For the 0 V to 2 × REF IN input range,  VDD = 4.75 V to 5.25 V.  \n0 CODING  This bit selects the type of output coding th at the  AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 will use for the conversion result. If this \nbit is set to 0 , the output coding for the part will be twos complement.

Table 10 \noutlines the three modes of operation of the sequencer. \nFigure 11 shows the traditional operation of a multichannel \nADC, where each serial transfer selects the next channel for conversion. In this mode of operation, the sequencer function  is not used.  \nFigure 12 shows how to program the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 \nto continuously convert on a sequence of consecutive channels \nfrom Channel 0 to a selected final channel. To exit this mode of operation and revert to the traditional mode of operation of a \nmultichannel ADC (as shown in Figure 11), ensure that the \nWRITE bit = 1 and SEQ1 = SEQ0 = 0 on the next serial transfer. \n \nTable 10. Sequence Selection \nSEQ1 SEQ0 Sequencer Function Description \n0 X Not used The sequencer function is not used. The analog  input channel selected for each individual \nconversion is determined by the contents of th e channel address bits, ADD1 and ADD0, in each \nprevious write operation. This mode of operation  reflects the traditiona l operation of a multi-\nchannel ADC, without using the sequencer func tion, where each write to the AD7904/AD7914/ \nAD7924 selects the next channel for conversion (see Figure 11). \n1 0 Used (not interrupted \nupon completion) The sequencer function is not interrupted upon completion of the write operation. This config-\nuration allows other bits in the control register to be altered between conversions while in a \nsequence without terminating the cycle. \n1 1 Continuous \nconversions This configuration is used in conjunction with  the channel address bits, ADD1 and ADD0, to \nprogram continuous conversions on a consecutive sequence of channels from Channel 0 to a \nselected final channel that is specified by the channel address bits in the control register (see Figure 12). \n \nCSCSPOWER ON\nDUMMY CONVERSION\nDIN: WRITE TO CONTROL REGISTER,\nWRITE BIT = 1,\nSELECT CODING, RANGE, AND POWER MODE.\nSELECT CHANNEL ADD1, ADD0 FOR CONVERSION.\nSEQ1 = 0, SEQ0 = x\nDOUT: CONVERSION RESULT FROM PREVIOUSLY\nSELECTED CHANNEL ADD1, ADD0\nDIN: WRITE TO CONTROL REGISTER,\nWRITE BIT = 1,SELECT CODING, RANGE, AND POWER MODE.\nSELECT ADD1, ADD0 FOR CONVERSION.\nSEQ1 = 0, SEQ0 = xWRITE BIT = 1,\nSEQ1 = 0, SEQ0 = x\n03087-011 \nFigure 11.

C | Page 18 of 32 CIRCUIT  INFORMATION \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 are , respectively , 8-bit, 10 -bit, \nand 12 -bit, high speed, 4 -channel, single -supply  ADCs . The parts  \ncan be operated from a 2.7 V to 5.25 V supply. When operated \nfrom either a 5 V or  3 V supply, the AD7904/AD7914/ AD7924 \nare capable of throughput rates of 1 MSPS when provided with a 20 MHz clock.  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 provide the user with an on -chip \ntrack -and-hold  ADC  and serial interface housed in a 16 -lead \nTSSOP package. The AD7904/AD7914/ AD7924 each  have four \nsingle -ended input channels with a channel sequencer, allowing  \nthe user to select a channel sequence through which the ADC \ncan cycle with each consecutive \nCS falling edge. The serial clock \ninput accesses data from the part, con trols the transfer of data  \nwritten to the ADC, and provides the clock source for the succes -\nsive approximation A DC. The analog input range for the AD7904/  \nAD7914/ AD7924 is 0 V to REF IN or 0 V to 2 × REF IN, depending on  \nthe status of Bit 1 in the control re gister . For the 0 V to 2 × REF IN \nrange , the part must be operated from a 4.75 V to 5.25 V supply.  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 provide flexible power management  \noptions to allow the user to achieve the best power performance \nfor a given throughput rate. These options are selected by pro -\ngramming the power management bits, PM1 and PM0, in the \ncontrol register . \nCONVERTER  OPERATION  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 are 8 -, 10-, and 12 -bit SAR ADCs,  \nrespectively,  based around a capacitive DAC. The AD7904/  \nAD7914/AD7924 can convert analog input signals in the range  \nof 0 V to R EF IN or 0 V to 2 ×  REF IN. Figure 13 and Figure 14 \nshow simplified schematics of the ADC. The AD7904/AD7914/  \nAD7924 include control logic,  the SAR  ADC , and a c apacitive \nDAC, which are used to add and subtract fixed amounts of charge  \nfrom the sampling capacitor to bring the comparator back into a balanced condition. Figure 13 shows the ADC during its \nacquisition phase. SW2 is clos ed and SW1 is in Position A.

ADC Conversion Phase  \nAnalog Input  \nFigure 15 shows an equivalent circuit of the analog input structure \nof the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924. The two diodes , D1 and D2 , \nprovide ESD protection for the  analog inputs. Care must be \ntaken to ensure that the analog input signal never exceeds the \nsupply rails by more than 200 mV . This will cause  these diodes \nto become forward -biased and start conducting current into the \nsubstrate. The maximum current th at th ese diodes can conduct \nwithout causing irreversible damage to the part is 10 mA . \nCapacitor C1 in Figure 15 is typically about 4  pF and can primarily  \nbe attributed to pin capacitance . The resistor , R1, is a lumped \ncomponent made up  of the on resistance of a track -and-hold  \nswitch and the on resistance of the input multiplexer. The total \nresistance is typically about 400 Ω . Capacitor C2 is the ADC \nsampling capacitor and has a capacitance of 30 pF typically . \nFor ac applications, removing high frequency components from the analog input sig nal is recommended by use of a low -pass RC \nfilter on the relevant analog input pin. In applications where  \nharmonic distortion and signal -to-noise ratio are critical, the \nanalog input should be driven from a low impedance source. \nLarge source impedances significantly affect the ac performance \nof the ADC. This may necessitate the use of an inp ut buffer \namplifier. The choice of the op amp is  a function of the \nparticular application.  \nWhen no amplifier is used to drive the analog input, the source impedance should be limited to low values. The maximum source  \nimpedance depend s on the amount of tota l harmonic distortion \n(THD) that can be tolerated. The THD increase s as the source \nimpedance increases , and performance will degrade (see Figure 8). \nC1\n4pFC2\n30pFR1D1\nD2AVDD\nVIN\nCONVERSION PHASE: SWITCH OPEN\nTRACK PHASE: SWITCH CLOSED\n03087-015 \nFigure 15.

The designed code transitions occur at successive LSB values (that is, 1 LSB, 2 LSBs, and so on). \nFor the 0 V to REF\nIN input range, the LSB size is REF IN/256 for \nthe AD7904, REF IN/1024 for the AD7914, and REF IN/4096 for \nthe AD7924. For the 0 V to 2 × REF IN input range, the LSB size \nis 2 × REF IN/256 for the AD7904, 2 × REF IN/1024 for the AD7914, \nand 2 × REF IN/4096 for the AD7924. The ideal transfer charac-\nteristic for the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 when straight binary coding is selected is shown in Figure 16; the ideal transfer \ncharacteristic for the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 when twos \ncomplement coding is selected is shown in Figure 17. \nADC CODE\n000…000\n0V\nANALOG INPUT111…111\n000…001000…010111…110\n•\n•\n111…000\n•\n011…111\n••\n1LSB\n+VREF – 1LSB\nNOTES\n1.

In this setup , the AGND pin is connected to \nthe analog ground plane of the system. In Figure 19, the REF IN \npin is connected to a decoupled 2.5 V supply from a reference \nsource, the AD780, to provide an analog input range of 0 V to \n2.5 V (if the RANGE bit is set to 1) or 0 V to 5 V (if the RANGE \nbit is set to 0).  \nAlthough the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 are  connected to a V DD \nof 5 V , the serial interface is connected to a 3 V microprocessor. \nThe V DRIVE  pin of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 is connected to \nthe same 3 V supply a s the microprocessor to allow a 3 V logic \ninterface (see the Digital Inputs  section). The conversion result \nis output in a 16 -bit word. This 16 -bit data stream consists of \ntwo leading zeros, two address bits indicating which chann el the \nconversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12 bits of \nconversion data for the AD7924 (10 bits of data for the AD7914 \nand 8 bits of data for the AD7904, each followed by two  and \nfour trailing zeros, respectively). For applications where power \nconsumption is of concern, the power -down modes should be \nused between conversions or bursts of several conversions to \nimprove power performance  (see the M odes of  Operation  \nsection ). \nNOTES\n1.ALL UNUSED INPUT CHANNELS SHOULD BE CONNECTED TO AGND.VIN0\nVIN3\nAGNDSCLK\nDOUT\nCS\nDINAD7904/\nAD7914/\nAD79240V TO REF IN\nREF IN VDRIVEAVDD0.1µF 10µF5V\nSUPPLY\nSERIAL\nINTERFACE\n0.1µF 0.1µF 10µFMICRO-\nCONTROLLER/\nMICRO-\nPROCESSOR\n2.5V\nAD7803V SUPPLY\n03087-019 \nFigure 19. Typical C onnection Diagram  Analog Input Selection  \nAny one of four analog input channels can  be selected for \nconversion by programming the multiplexer with the address bits ADD1 and ADD0 in the control register . The channel \nconfigurations are shown in  Table 7. \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 can also be configured to auto-\nmatically cycle  through a number of selected  channels . The \nsequencer feature is accessed via the SEQ1 and SEQ0 bits in the \ncontrol register  (see Table 10). The AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 \ncan be programmed to continuously convert on a number of consecutive  channels in ascending order from Channel 0 to a \nselected final channel as determined by the channel address \nbits, ADD1 and ADD0. This is possible if the SEQ1 and SEQ0 \nbits are  set to 1 1. The next serial transfer will then act on the \nsequence programmed by executing a conversion on Channel 0.  \nThe next serial transfer will result in a conversion on Channel 1, \nand so on, until the channel selected via the address bits , ADD1  \nand ADD0 , is reached.  \nIt is not necessary to write to the control register  again after a \nsequence operation has been initiated. T o ensure that the control  \nregister is not accidently overwritten or the sequence operation interrupted, the WRITE bi t must be set to 0  or the DIN line \nmust be tied low. If the  control register  is written to at any time \nduring the sequence, the SEQ1 and SEQ0 bits must be  set to 1 0 \nto avoid interrupting the automatic conversion sequence. This  \npattern continue s until the A D7904/AD7914/AD7924 are \nwritten to and the SEQ1 and SEQ0 bits are configured with a  bit \ncombination other than  10, resulting in the termination of the \nsequence. If the sequence is uninterrupted (WRITE bit = 0, or WRITE bit = 1 and SEQ1 and SEQ0 bits are se t to 1 0), then upon \ncompletion of the sequence, the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 sequencer return s to Channel 0 and restarts  the sequence.  \nRegardless of the  channel selection method used, the 16 -bit \nword output from the AD7924 during each conversion always contain s two leading zeros, two channel address bits that the \nconversion result corresponds to, followed by the 12 -bit con -\nversion result; the AD7914 output s two leading zeros, two \nchannel address bits that the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 10 -bit conversion result and two trailing zeros; \nthe AD7904 output s two leading zeros, two channel address bits \nthat the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the 8 -bit \nconversion result and four trailing zeros  (see the S erial Interface  \nsection).  \nData Sheet  AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 \n \nRev. C | Page 21 of 32 Digital Inputs  \nThe digital inputs applied to the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 can \ngo to 7 V and are not restricted by the A VDD + 0.3 V limit on the \nanalog inputs.  \nBecause the SCLK, DIN, and CS inputs are not restricted by the \nAVDD + 0.3 V limit , power supply sequencing issues are avoided. \nIf CS, DIN, or SCLK is  applied before A VDD, there is no risk of \nlatch -up as there would be on the analog inputs if a signal \ngreater than 0.3  V is applied prior to A VDD. \nVDRIVE  \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 also include  the V DRIVE  feature. \nVDRIVE  controls the voltage at which the serial interface operates. \nVDRIVE  allows the ADC to easily interface to both 3 V and 5 V \nprocessors. For example, if the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 a re \nopera ted with a V DD o f  5  V,  t h e  V DRIVE  pin c an be powered from a 3 V supply. The AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 have better \ndynamic performance with a V DD of 5 V while still being able to \ninterface to 3 V processors. Care should be taken to ensure that \nVDRIVE  does not e xceed AVDD by more than 0.3 V  (see the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  section).  \nReference \nAn external reference source should be used to supply the 2.5 V \nreference to the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924. Errors in the refer -\nence source result in g ain errors in the AD7904/ AD7914/  \nAD7924 transfer function and add to the specified full -scale \nerrors  of the part. A capacitor of at least 0.1 µ F should be placed \non the REF IN pin. Suitable re ference sources for the AD7904/  \nAD7914/AD7924 include the AD780, REF193, and AD1582. \nIf 2.5 V is applied to the REF IN pin, the analog input range can \nbe either 0 V to 2.5 V or 0 V to 5 V , depending on the setting of \nthe RANGE bit in the control register . \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 22 of 32 MODES OF OPERATION \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 have three  modes of operation. \nThese modes are designed to provide flexible power management  \noptions. These options can be chosen to optimi ze the power \ndissipation/throughput rate ratio for differing application require -\nments. The mode of operation of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 \nis controlled by the power management bits, PM1 and PM0, in the control register  (see Table 9). When power supplies are first \napplied to the AD7904 /AD7914/AD7924, care should be taken to  \nensure that the part is placed in the required mode of operation (see the Powering Up the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 section).  \nNORMAL MODE (P M1 = PM0 = 1)  \nNormal  mode is intended for the fastest throughput rate perfor -\nmance . Because the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 remain fully \npowered up at all times , the user does not need  to worry about \npower -up times. Figure 20 shows the g eneral diagram of the \noperation of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 in this mode.  \nNOTES\n1.

Normal Mode Operation  \nThe conversion is initiated on the falling edge of CS; the track -\nand-hold enters hold mode as described in the S erial Interface  \nsection. The data presented to the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 on the DIN line during the first 12 clock cycles of the data transfer is loaded into the control register (provided that the WRITE bit is set to 1 ). In normal mode, the part remains fully \npowered up at the end of the conversion as long as the PM1 and PM0 bits are set to 1 in the write transfer during that same \nconversion. To ensure continued operation in normal mode, \nPM1 and PM0 must both be set to 1 o n every data transfer, \nassuming that a write operation is taking place. If the WRITE bit is set to 0, the power management bits are  left unchanged , \nand the part remain s in normal mode.  \nSixteen serial clock cycles are required to complete the conversion  \nand to access the conversion result. The track -and-hold  returns \nto track mode on the 14th  SCLK falling edge. \nCS may then idle \nhigh until the next conversion or it may idle low until some  \ntime prior to the next conversion (effectively idling CS low).  \nWhen  a data transfer is complete (DOUT has returned to three -\nstate), another conversion can be initiated after the quiet time, \ntQUIET , has elapsed by bringing CS low again. FULL SHUTDOWN MODE (PM1 = 1, PM0 = 0)  \nIn full shutdown  mode, all internal circuitry on the AD7904/ \nAD7914/ AD7924 is powered down. The part retains information  \nin the control register during fu ll shutdown. The AD7904/AD7914/  \nAD7924 remain in full shutdown until the power management \nbits in the  control register , PM1 and PM0, are changed.  \nIf a write to the control register  occurs while the part is in full \nshutdown , and the power management bits are changed to  \nPM0 = PM1 = 1  (that is , normal  mode ), the part will begin to \npower up on the CS rising edge. The track -and-hold , which was \nin hold mode while the part was in full shutdown , return s to \ntrack mode on the 14th  SCLK falling edge. \nTo ensure that the part is fully powered up, t POWER -UP (t12) should \nhave elapsed before the next CS falling edge. Figure 21 shows \nthe general diagram for this sequence.  \nAUTO SHUTDOWN MODE (PM1 = 0, PM0 = 1)  \nIn auto shutdown  mode, the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 auto -\nmatically enter shutdown at the end of each convers ion when \nthe control register is updated. When the part is in auto shutdown,  \nthe track -and-hold  is in hold mode. Figure 22 shows the general \ndiagram of the operation of the AD7904/AD7914/ AD7924 in \nthis mode.  \nIn auto shutdown mode , all internal circuitry on the AD7904/  \nAD7914/AD7924 is powered down. The part retains information  \nin the control register  during auto shutdown. The AD7904/  \nAD7914/AD7924 remain in shutdown until the next CS falling \nedge that it receives.  On this CS falling edge , the track -and-hold , \nwhich was in hold mode while the part was in shutdown , return s \nto track  mode . Wake -up time from auto shutdown is 1 µs max -\nimum, and the user should ensure that 1  µs has elapsed before \nattempti ng a valid conversion.  \nWhen running the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 with a 20 MHz clock, one 16 SCLK dummy cycle should be sufficient to ensure that the part is fully powered up. During this dummy cycle , the \ncontents of the control register  should remain unchang ed; \ntherefore , the WRITE bit should be set to 0 on the DIN line. \nThis dummy cycle effectively halves the throughput rate of the part, with every other conversion result being valid. In auto shutdown  mode , the power consumption of the part is greatly \nreduce d because  the part enter s shutdown at the end of each \nconversion. When the control register  is programmed to move \ninto auto shutdown  mode , it does so at the end of the con -\nversion. The user can move the ADC in and out of the low \npower state by controlling the \nCS signal. \nData Sheet  AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 \n \nRev.

However, the minimum power -up time of \n1 µs must be allowed from the rising edge of CS, where the \ncontr ol register is updated, before attempting the first valid \nconversion. This power -up time  allow s for the possibility that \nthe part  was initially powered up in shutdown mode.  \nIf the desired mode of operation is full shutdown , one dummy \ncycle is required afte r supplies are applied. In this dummy cycle , \nthe user simply sets the power management bits, PM1  and PM0 , \nto 10 and, upon the rising edge of CS at the end of that serial \ntransfer , the part enter s full shutdown  mode . If the desired mode o f operation after supplies are applied is \nauto shutdown  mode , two dummy cycles are  required : the first \ndummy cycle with DIN tied high, and the second to set the \npower management bits , PM1 and PM0 , to 01. On the second  CS \nrising edge after  the supplies are applied, the control register  \ncontain s the correct information and the part enter s auto \nshutdown  mode as programmed. If power consumption is of \ncritical concern, then in the first dummy cycle , the user can  set \nPM1  and PM0 to 10, that is , full shutdown  mode , and then place \nthe part into auto shutdown  mode in the second dummy cycle. \nFor illustration purposes , Figure 25 is shown with DIN tied \nhigh on the first dummy cycle in this case.  \nFigure  23, Figure 24, and Figure 25 show the required dummy \ncycle s after suppl ies are applied for normal mode, full shutdown  \nmode, and auto shutdown  mode, respectively . \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 25 of 32 POWER  vs. THROUGHPUT  RATE  \nBy operating the AD7904/AD7914/ AD7924 in auto shutdown \nmode , the average power consumption of the ADC decreases at \nlower throughput rates. Figure 26 shows how , as the throughput \nrate is reduced, the part remains in its shutdown state longer , and \nthe average power consumption over time drops accordingly.  \nFor example, if the AD7924 is operated in continuous sampling \nmode  with a throughput rate of 100 kSPS and an SCLK of 20  MHz  \n(AVDD = 5 V), and the device is placed in to auto shutdown  mode  \n(PM1 = 0 and PM0 = 1 ), the power consumption is calculated \nas described in this section.  \nThe maximum power dissipation during normal opera tion is \n13.5 mW ( AVDD = 5 V). If the power -up time from auto shutdown  \nis one dummy cycle, that is , 1 µs, and the remaining conversion \ntime is another cycle, that is , 1 µs, then the AD7924 can be said \nto dissipate 13.5 mW for 2 µ s during each conversion cycle. For \nthe remainder of the conversion cycle, 8 µ s, the part remains in \nshutdown. The AD7924 can be said to dissipate 2.5  µW for the \nremaining 8 μs of the  conversion cycle. If the throughput rate is \n100 kSPS, the cycle time is 10 µs and the average power dissipated  \nduring each cycle is ((2/10) × 13.5 mW) + ((8/10) × 2.5 µW) = \n2.702 mW .  \nFigure 26 shows the maximum power vs. throughput rate when \nusing the auto shutdown  mode with 5 V and 3 V supplies.  \n10\n0.010.11\n0 350 300 250 200 150 100 50POWER (mW)\nTHROUGHPUT (kSPS)AVDD = 5V\nAVDD = 3V\n03087-026 \nFigure 26. AD7924 Power vs. Throughput Rate  \nSERIAL INTERFACE  \nFigure 27, Figure 28, and Figure 29 show the detailed timing \ndiagrams for serial interfacing to the AD7904, AD7914, and AD7924, respectively. The serial clock provides the conversion \nclock and controls the transfer of information to and from the \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 during each conversion.  The \nCS signal initiates the data transfer and conversion process. \nThe falling edge of CS puts the track -and-hold  into hold mode  \nand takes the bus out of three -state ; the analog input is sampled \nat this point. The conversion is also initiated at this point and require s 16 SCLK cycles to complete. The track -and-hold  returns  \nto track mode on the 14th  SCLK falling edge , as shown by Point B  \nin \nFigure 27, Figure 28, and Figure 29. On the 16th  SCLK falling \nedge, the DOUT line returns to  three -state. If the rising edge of \nCS occurs before 16 SCLKs have elapsed, the conversion is  \nterminated, the DOUT line returns to  three -state, and the \ncontrol register  is not updated; otherwise , DOUT returns to \nthree -state on the 16th SCLK falling edge , as shown in Figure 27, \nFigure 28, and Figure 29. \nSixteen serial clock cycles are required to perform the conversion  \nprocess  and to access data from the AD7904 /AD7914/AD7924. \nFor the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924, the 8/10/12 bits of data are \npreceded by two leading zeros and t he two channel address bits , \nADD1 and ADD0, which identify the channel th at th e result \ncorresponds to. CS going low clocks out the first leading zero to \nbe read in by the microcontroller or DSP on the first falling edge of  \nSCLK. The first falling edge of SCLK also clock s out the second \nleading zero to be read in by the microcontroller or DSP on the second SCLK falling edge, and so on. The two address bits and \nthe 8/10/12 data bits are then clocked out by subsequent SCLK \nfalling edges beginning with the first address bit , ADD1; thus , \nthe second falling clock edge on the serial clock has the second leading zero provided and also clocks o ut the address bit ADD1. \nThe final bit in the data transfer is valid on the 16th falling edge, \nhaving been clocked out on the previous ( 15th) falling  edge.  \nThe w riting of information to the control register  takes place on \nthe first 12 falling edges of SCLK  in a data transfer, assuming \nthat the MSB (the WRITE bit)  has bee n set to 1.  \nThe AD7904 outputs two leading zeros, two channel address \nbits that the conversion result corresponds to, followed by the  8-bit conversion result  and four trailing zeros. The AD 7914 \noutpu ts two leading zeros, two channel address bits that the \nconversion result corresponds to, followed by the 10 -bit \nconversion  result and two trailing zeros. The 16 -bit word read \nfrom the AD7924 always contain s two leading zeros, two \nchannel address  bits that the conversion result corresponds to, \nfollowed by the 12 -bit conversion result.  \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

C | Page 27 of 32 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION  \nMICROPROCESSOR  INTERFACING  \nThe serial interface o f the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 allows  \n the part to be directly connected to a range of different \nmicroprocessors. T his section explains how to interface the \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 to some of the more common \nmicrocontroller and DSP serial interface protocols.  \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 to TMS320C541  \nThe serial interface o f the TMS320C541 uses a continuous serial \nclock and frame  synchronization signals to synchronize the data \ntransfer operations with peripheral devices such as  the AD7904/  \nAD7914/AD7924. The CS input allows easy interfacing between \nthe TM S320C541 and the AD7904/ AD7914/ AD7924 without any  \nglue logi c required. The serial port of the TMS320C541 is set up \nto operate in burst mode with internal CLKX0 (TX serial clock \non Serial Port 0) and FSX0 (TX frame sync from S erial Port 0). \nThe serial port control (SPC) register must have the following \nsetup: FO = 0, FSM = 1, MCM = 1, and TXM = 1. The connection  \ndiagram is shown in Figure 30. Note  that for signal processing \napplications, it is imperative that the frame synchronization \nsignal from the TMS320C541 provide  equidistant sampling.  \nThe V DRIVE  pin of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 takes the same \nsupply voltage as the TMS320C541. This allows the ADC to \noperate at a higher voltage than the serial interface, that is , the \nTMS320C541, if necessary.  \n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY.TMS320C541*\nCLKX\nCLKRSCLK\nFSX\nFSRCSDR DOUT\nDT DIN\nVDRIVEAD7904/\nAD7914/\nAD7924*\nVDD\n03087-030 \nFigure 30. Interfacing to the TMS320C541  \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 to ADSP -218 x \nThe ADSP -218x family of DSPs interface s directly to the \nAD7904/ AD7914/AD7924 without any glue logic required.  \nThe V DRIVE  pin of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 takes the same \nsupply voltage as the ADSP -218x . This allows the ADC to \noperate at a higher voltage than the serial interface, that is , the \nADSP -218x, if necessary.  The SPORT0 control register of the ADSP -218x should be set \nup as follows:  \nTFSW = RFSW = 1, a lternate framing  \nINVRFS = INVTFS = 1, a ctive low frame signal  \nDTYPE = 00, r ight justify data \nSLEN = 1111, 16- bit data-words  \nISCLK = 1, i nternal serial clock \nTFSR = RFSR = 1, f rame every word \nIRFS = 0  \nITFS = 1  \nThe connection diagram is shown in Figure 31. The ADSP -218x \nhas the TFS and RFS of the SPORT tied together, with TFS set \nas an output and RFS set as an input. The DSP operates in a lter-\nnate framing mode and the SPORT 0 control register is set up as \ndescribed. The frame synchronization signal generated on the \nTFS is tied t o CS and, as with all signal processing applications, \nequidistant sampling is necessary. However, in this example, the \ntimer interrupt is used to control the sampling rate of the ADC, \nand under certain conditions equidistant sampling may not be achieved.  \n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY.ADSP-218x*\nSCLK SCLK\nVDRIVEAD7904/\nAD7914/\nAD7924*\nDT DINDR DOUT\nVDDRFS\nTFSCS\n03087-031 \nFigure 31. Interfacing to the ADSP -218x  \nThe t imer register , for example, is loaded with a value that \nprovide s an interrupt at the required sample interval. When an \ninterrupt is received, a value is transmitted wi th TFS/DT (ADC \ncontrol word). The TFS is used to control the RFS and thus the reading of data. The frequency of the serial clock is set in the \nSCLKDIV register. When the instruction to transmit with TFS \nis given ( that is , AX0 = TX0), the state of the SCLK is checked. \nThe DSP waits until SCLK goes  high, low, and h igh again before \ntransmission start s. If the timer and SCLK values are chosen in \nsuch a way that the instruction to transmit occurs on or near \nthe rising edge of SCLK, the data may be transmitted or  it may \nwait until the next clock edge.  \nFor example, if the ADSP -2189 has  a 20 MHz crystal so  that its \nmaster clock frequency is  40 MHz, then the master cycle time is  \n25 ns. If the SCLKDIV register is loaded with the value 3, then \nan SCLK of 5 MHz is obtained and eight master clock periods \nelapse for every one SCLK period.  \n \nAD7904/AD7914/AD7924 Data Sheet  \n \nRev. C | Page 28 of 32 Depending on the throughput rate s elected, if the timer register \nis loaded with a  value  such as  803 (803 + 1 = 804), then 100.5 \nSCLKs will occur between interrupts and subsequently between \ntransmit instructions. This setup  result s in nonequidistant \nsampling because  the transmit instruction occur s on an SCLK \nedge. If the number of SCLKs between interrupts is a whole integer value  N, equidistant sampling is  implemented by the DSP .  \nAD7904/AD 7914/AD7924 to DSP563xx  \nThe connection diagram in Figure 32 shows how the AD7904/  \nAD7914/AD7924 can be connected to the ESSI ( synchronous \nserial i nterface) of the DSP563xx family of DSPs from Motorola.  \nEach ESSI (two on board) is operated in synchronous mode \n(SYN  bit in CRB = 1) with internally generated 1 -bit clock \nperiod frame sync for both Tx and Rx (bits FSL1 = 0 and FSL0 =  \n0 in CRB). Normal operation of the ESSI is selected by sett ing \nMOD  = 0 in the CRB. Set the word length to  16 by setting bits \nWL1 = 1 and WL0 = 0 in CRA. The FSP bit in the CRB should be set to 1 so th at th e frame sync is negative. Note  that for signal \nprocessing applications, it is imperative that the frame synchroni-zation signal from the DSP563xx  provide  equidistant sampling.  \nIn the example shown in Figure 32, the serial clock is taken from  \nthe ESSI so the SCK0 pin must be set as an output  (SCKD = 1 ). \nThe V\nDRIVE  pin of the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 takes the same \nsupply voltage as the DS P563xx. This allows the ADC to operate \nat a higher voltage than the serial interface, that is , the DSP563xx,  \nif necessary.  \n*ADDITIONAL PINS REMOVED FOR CLARITY.DSP563xx*\nVDRIVEAD7904/\nAD7914/\nAD7924*\nSC2 DINSRD DOUTSCK SCLK\nVDDSTD CS\n03087-032 \nFigure 32. Interfacing to the DSP563xx  GROUNDING AND LAYOUT \nThe AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 have very good immun ity to \nnoise on the power supplies ( see Figure 6). However, care \nshould be taken with regard to grounding and layout.  \nThe PCB that houses the AD7904/AD7914/ AD7924 should be \ndesigned such that the analog and digital sections are se parated \nand confined to certain areas of the board. This  facilitates the \nuse of ground planes that can be easily  separated . A minimum \netch technique is generally best for ground planes because  it \nprovides  the best shielding. All four AGND pins of the AD790 4/ \nAD7914/AD7924 should be sunk in the AGND plane. Digital and analog ground planes should be joined at only one place. If the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924 are  in a system where m ultiple \ndevices require an AGND -to-DGND connection, the connection \nshould still be ma de at one point only : a star ground point \nestablished as close as possible to the AD7904/AD7914/AD7924.  \nAvoid running digital lines under the device because  these lines  \ncouple noise onto the die. The analog ground plane should be \nallowed to run under the A D7904/AD7914/AD7924 to avoid \nnoise coupling. The po wer supply lines to the AD7904/ AD7914/  \nAD7924 should use as large a trace as possible to provide low \nimpedance paths and reduce the effects of glitches on the power supp ly line. Fast switching signals such  as clocks  should be \nshielded with digital ground to avoid radiating noise to other sections of the board, and clock signals should never be run near the analog inputs. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals. Traces on opposite sides of the board sh ould run at \nright angles to each other  to reduce the effects of feedthrough \nthrough the board. A microstrip technique is by far the best , but \nis not always possible with a double -sided board. In this \ntechnique, the component side of the board is dedicated to ground planes while signals are placed on the solder side.  \nGood decoupling is also important. All analog supplies should be decoupled with 10 μF tantalum capacitors in parallel with  \n0.1 μF capacitors to AGND. To achieve the best performance \nfrom these decoupling components, place  them  as close as \npossible to the device, ideally right up against the device. The \n0.1 μF capacitors should h ave low e ffective series resistance \n(ESR) and effective series inductance (ESI), such as the common  \nceramic types or surface -mount types, which provide a low \nimpedance path to ground at high frequencies to handle transient currents due to internal logic sw itching.  \n \nData Sheet AD7904/AD7914/AD7924\n \nRev.
