This voltage regulator is exceptionally easy to use andrequires only two external resistors to set the output voltage. Further, it\nemploys internal current limiting, thermal shutdown and safe area\ncompensation, making it essentially blow −out proof.\nThe LM317 serves a wide variety of applications including local, on\ncard regulation. This device can also be used to make a programmable\noutput regulator, or by connecting a fixed resistor between theadjustment and output, the LM317 can be used as a precision currentregulator.\nFeatures\n•Output Current in Excess of 1.5 A\n•Output Adjustable between 1.2 V and 37 V\n•Internal Thermal Overload Protection\n•Internal Short Circuit Current Limiting Constant with Temperature\n•Output Transistor Safe −Area Compensation\n•Floating Operation for High V oltage Applications\n•Eliminates Stocking many Fixed V oltages\n•Available in Surface Mount D2PAK−3, and Standard 3 −Lead\nTransistor Package\n•NCV Prefix for Automotive and Other Applications Requiring\nUnique Site and Control Change Requirements; AEC −Q100\nQualified and PPAP Capable\n•These Devices are Pb −Free, Halogen Free/BFR Free and are RoHS\nCompliant\nFigure 1.

Power dissipation within an IC voltage regulator produces a temperature gradient on the die, affecting indiv idual IC components on the die.\nThese effects can be minimized by proper integrated circuit design and layout techniques. Thermal Regulation is the effect of t hese\ntemperature gradients on the output voltage and is expressed in percentage of output change per watt of power change in a specified time.\n5.

In\noperation, the LM317 develops and maintains a nominal1.25 V reference (V\nref) between its output and adjustment\nterminals. This reference voltage is converted to aprogramming curr ent (I\nPROG ) by R 1 (see Figure 17), and this\nconstant current flows through R 2 to ground.\nThe regulated output voltage is given by:\nVout/C8201/C0043/C8201Vref/C8201/C04661/C0041R2\nR1/C0467/C8201/C0041/C8201IAdj/C8201R2\nSince the current from the adjustment terminal (I Adj)\nrepresents an error term in the equation, the LM317 was\ndesigned to control I Adj to less than 100 /C0109A and keep it\nconstant. To do this, all quiescent operating current is\nreturned to the output terminal. This imposes therequirement for a minimum load current. If the load current\nis less than this minimum, the output voltage will rise.\nSince the LM317 is a floating regulator, it is only the\nvoltage differential across the circuit which is important toperformance, and operation at high voltages with respect to\nground is possible.\nFigure 19. Basic Circuit Configuration+\nVrefAdjustVinVout\nLM317\nR1\nIPROGVout\nR2IAdj\nVref = 1.25 V TypicalVout\nLoad Regulation\nThe LM317 is capable of providing extremely good load\nregulation, but a few precautions are needed to obtainmaximum performance. For best performance, theprogramming resistor (R\n1) should be connected as close to\nthe regulator as possible to minimize line drops whicheffectively appear in series with the reference, therebydegrading regulation. The ground end of R\n2 can be returned\nnear the load ground to provide remote ground sensing and\nimprove load regulation.External Capacitors\nA 0.1 /C0109F disc or 1.0 /C0109F tantalum input bypass capacitor\n(Cin) is recommended to reduce the sensitivity to input line\nimpedance.\nThe adjustment terminal may be bypassed to ground to\nimprove ripple rejection. This capacitor (C Adj) prevents\nripple from being amplified as the output voltage is\nincreased. A 10 /C0109F capacitor should improve ripple\nrejection about 15 dB at 120 Hz in a 10 V application.\nAlthough the LM317 is stable with no output capacitance,\nlike any feedback circuit, certain values of externalcapacitance can cause excessive ringing. An output\ncapacitance (C\nO) in the form of a 1.0 /C0109F tantalum or 25 /C0109F\naluminum electrolytic capacitor on the output swamps this\neffect and insures stability.\nProtection Diodes\nWhen external capacitors are used with any IC regulator\nit is sometimes necessary to add protection diodes to preventthe capacitors from discharging through low current points\ninto the regulator.\nFigure 18 shows the LM317 with the recommended\nprotection diodes for output voltages in excess of 25 V or\nhigh capacitance values (C\nO > 25 /C0109F, C Adj > 10 /C0109F). Diode\nD1 prevents C O from discharging thru the IC during an input\nshort circuit. Diode D 2 protects against capacitor C Adj\ndischarging through the IC during an output short circuit.The combination of diodes D\n1 and D 2 prevents C Adj from\ndischarging through the IC during an input short circuit.\nFigure 20.
