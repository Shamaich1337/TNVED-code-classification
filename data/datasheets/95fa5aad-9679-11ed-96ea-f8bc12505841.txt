The devices operate from ±5 V to ±15 V dual supply. \nThe ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  provide benefits previously found \nin few amplifiers. These amplifiers combine the best specifications \nof precision dc and high speed ac op amps. The ADA4637-1  is  \na decompensated version of the ADA4627-1  and is stable at a \nnoise gain of 5 or greater.  \nWith a typical offset voltage of only 70 μV , drift of less than \n1 μV/°C, and noise of only 0.86 μV p-p (0.1 Hz to 10 Hz), the \nADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  are suited for applications where error \nsources cannot be tolerated. The ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  are specified for both the \nindustrial temperature range of −25°C to +85°C and the \nextended industrial temperature range of −40°C to +125°C. The ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  are available in tiny 8-lead LFCSP and \n8-lead SOIC packages. \nThe ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  are members of a growing series \nof high speed, precision op amps offered by Analog Devices, Inc. \n(see Table 1). \n \nTable 1.

F | Page 14 of 20 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADA4627-1  is a high speed, unity gain stable amplifier with \nexcellent dc characteristics. The ADA4637-1  is a decompensated \nversion that is stable at a gain of 5 or greater. The typical offset \nvoltage of 70 μV allows the amplifiers to be easily configured for \nhigh gains without the risk of excessive output voltage errors. The \nsmall temperature drift of 2 μV/°C ensures a minimum offset voltage error over the entire temperature range of −40°C to +125°C, making the amplifiers ideal for a variety of sensitive \nmeasurement applications in harsh operating environments.  \nINPUT VOLTAGE RANGE \nThe ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  are not  rail-to-rail input \namplifiers; therefore, care is required to ensure that both inputs \ndo not exceed the input voltage range. Under normal negative \nfeedback operating conditions, the amplifier corrects its output \nto ensure that the two inputs are at the same voltage. However, if either input exceeds the input voltage range, the loop opens, and large currents begin to flow through the ESD protection \ndiodes in the amplifier.  \nThese diodes are connected between the inputs and each supply \nrail to protect the input transistors against an electrostatic discharge \nevent, and they are normally reverse-biased. However, if the input \nvoltage exceeds the supply voltage, these ESD diodes can become forward-biased. Without current limiting, excessive amounts  of current can flow through these diodes, causing permanent damage to the device. If inputs are subject to overvoltage, insert \nappropriate series resistors to limit the diode current to less \nthan 5 mA. \nINPUT OFFSET VOLTAGE ADJUST RANGE \nThe ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  SOIC packages have offset  \nadjust pins for compatibility with some existing designs. The recommended offset nulling circuit is shown in Figure 47.  \n \nFigure 47. Standard Offset Null Circuit \nWith a 100 kΩ potentiometer, the adjustment range is  \nmore than ±11 mV . However, the V OS temperature drift \nincreases by several μV/°C for every millivolt of offset adjust. The ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  have matching thin film resistors \nthat are laser trimmed at two temperatures to minimize both \noffset voltage and offset voltage drift. The offset voltage at room \ntemperature is less than 0.5 mV , and the offset voltage drift is only a few μV/°C or less; therefore, it is not recommended to use the offset adjust pins, especially for offset adjust of a complete signal chain. Signal chain offset can be addressed with an auto-zero amplifier used to form a composite amplifier; or, if the ADA4627-1  or the ADA4637-1  is in an inverting amplifier \nstage, it can be modified easily to add a potentiometer (see \nFigure 48). The LFCSP package does not have offset adjust pins.  \n \nFigure 48. Alternate Offset Null Circuit for Inverting Stage \nINPUT BIAS CURRENT \nBecause the ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  have a JFET input stage, \nthe input bias current, due to the reverse-biased junction, has  \na leakage current that approximately doubles every 10°C. The \npower dissipation of the device, combined with the thermal resistance of the package, results in the junction temperature increasing 20°C to 30°C above ambient. This parameter is tested with high speed ATE equipment, which does not result in the die \ntemperature reaching equilibrium. This is correlated with bench \nmeasurements to match the guaranteed maximum at room \ntemperature shown in Table 2.  \nThe input current can be reduced by keeping the temperature as \nlow as possible and using a light load on the output. \nNOISE CONSIDERATIONS \nThe JFET input stage offers very low input voltage noise and \ninput current noise. The thermal noise of a 1 kΩ resistor at \nroom temperature is 4 nV/√Hz; therefore, low values of resistance should be used for dc-coupled inverting and \nnoninverting amplifier configurations. In the case of \ntransimpedance amplifiers (TIAs), current noise is more \nimportant.  \nThe ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  are an excellent choice for both of \nthese applications. Analog Devices offers a wide variety of low \nvoltage noise and low current noise op amps in a variety of processes that are optimized for different supply voltage ranges. \nRefer to Application Note AN-940  for a discussion of noise, \ncalculations, and selection tables for more than three dozen low \nnoise, op amp families.  07559-0512\n367\n4ADA4627-1\n–VS+VS\n100kΩ\n1\n5\n07559-0522\n36 ADA4627-1 +\nVOUT\n–VIN+\n–RF\nRIN\n200Ω100kΩ499kΩ 499kΩ\n0.1µF\n–VS+VS\nData Sheet ADA4627-1/ADA4637-1\n \nRev. F | Page 15 of 20 THD + N MEASUREMENTS \nTotal harmonic distortion plus noise (THD + N) is usually \nmeasured with an audio analyzer, such as those from Audio \nPrecision, Inc™. The analyzer consists of a low distortion oscillator that is swept from the starting frequency to the \nending frequency. The oscillator is connected to the circuit \nunder test, and the output of the circuit goes back to the analyzer.  \nThe analyzer has a tunable notch filter in lock step with the \nswept oscillator. This removes the fundamental frequency  but allows all of the harmonics and wideband noise to be measured with an integrating voltmeter. However, there is a switchable low-pass filter in series with the notch filter. If the sine wave is at 100 Hz, then the tenth harmonic is still at 1 kHz; \ntherefore, having a low pass at 80 kHz is not a problem. When \nthe oscillator reaches 20 kHz, the fourth harmonic (80 kHz)  is partially attenuated, resulting in a lower reading from the voltmeter. When evaluating THD + N curves from any manufacturer, careful attention should be paid to the test \nconditions. The difference between an 80 kHz low-pass filter \nand a 500 kHz filter is shown in Figure 49. \n \nFigure 49. THD + N vs. Frequency \nPRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD LAYOUT, BIAS \nCURRENT, AND BYPASSING \nTo take advantage of the very low input bias current of the \nADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  at room temperature, leakage paths \nmust be considered. A printed circuit board (PCB), with dust \nand humidity, can have 100 MΩ of resistance over a few tenths of an inch. A 1 mV differential between the two points results in  10 pA of leakage current, more than the guaranteed maximum.  \nThe op amp inputs should be guarded by surrounding the nets \nwith a metal trace maintained at the predicted voltage. In the \ncase of an inverting configuration or transimpedance amplifier, (see Figure 50), the inverting and noninverting nodes can be \nsurrounded by traces held at a quiet analog ground.  \nFigure 50. Inverting Amplifier with Guard \nFor a noninverting configuration, the trace can be driven from \nthe feedback divider, but the resistors should be chosen to offer a low impedance drive to the trace (see Figure 51). \n \nFigure 51. Noninverting Amplifier with Guard \nThe board layout should be compact with traces as short as possible. For second-order board considerations, such as \ntriboelectric effects and piezoelectric effects, as well as a table  \nof insulating material properties, see the AD549  data sheet.  \nIn some cases, shielding from air currents may be helpful.  \nA general rule of thumb, for op amps with gain bandwidth products higher than 1 MHz, bypass capacitors should be very close to the device, within 3 mm. Each supply should be bypassed with a 0.01 μF ceramic capacitor in parallel with a \n1 \uf06dF bulk decoupling capacitor. The ceramic capacitors should \nbe closer to the op amp. Sockets, which add inductance and \ncapacitance, should not be used. \nOUTPUT PHASE REVERSAL \nOutput phase reversal occurs in some amplifiers when the input \ncommon-mode voltage range is exceeded. As common-mode \nvoltage is moved outside the common-mode range, the outputs of these amplifiers can suddenly jump in the opposite direction to the supply rail. This is the result of the differential input pair \nshutting down, causing a radical shifting of internal voltages \nthat results in the erratic output behavior.  \nThe ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  amplifiers are carefully designed \nto prevent any output phase reversal if both inputs are maintained \nwithin or slightly above the power supply rails. The ADA4627-1 / \nADA4637-1  do not phase reverse, as shown in Figure 34.  \n \n 0.01 0.1 1 10 100THD + N (%)\nFREQUENCY (kHz)80kHz FILTER500kHz FILTER0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n0.00001ADA4627-1\nTA = 25°C\nVSY = ±15V\nVIN = 810mV\nRL = 600Ω\n07559-017\n07559-0532\n36\n8ADA4627-1 +\nVOUT\n– INCF\nRFGUARD\n07559-0543\n26\n8ADA4627-1 +VOUT\n–VS+\n–GUARD\nRF\nRI\nADA4627-1/ADA4637-1 Data Sheet\n \nRev. F | Page 16 of 20 DECOMPENSATED OP AMPS \nThe ADA4637-1  is a decompensated op amp, and, as such, must \nalways be operated at a noise gain of 5 or greater. See tutorial \nMT-033, Voltage Feedback Op Amp Gain and Bandwidth , at \nwww.analog.com  for more information.  \nDRIVING CAPACITIVE LOADS \nAdding capacitance to the output of any op amp results in \nadditional phase shift, which reduces stability and leads to \novershoot or oscillation. The ADA4627-1 /ADA4637-1  have a high phase margin and low \noutput impedance, so they can drive reasonable values of \ncapacitance. This is a common situation when an amplifier is used to drive the input of switched capacitor ADCs.
