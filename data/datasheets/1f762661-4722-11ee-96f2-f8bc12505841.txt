Functional Description\n•8-Bit Shift Register (P-IN, S-OUT)\n2. General\n The 74HC165D is a high speed CMOS 8-BIT PARALLEL/SERIAL-IN, SERIAL-OUT SHIFT REGISTER\nfabricated with silicon gate C 2MOS technology.\n It achieves the high speed operation similar to equivalent LSTTL while maintaining the CMOS low power\ndissipation.\n It consists of parallel-in or serial-in, serial-out 8-bit shift register with a gated clock inputs. When the SHIFT/\nLOAD  input is held high, the serial data input is enabled and the eight frip-frops perform serial shifting with\neach clock pulse.\n When the SHIFT/ LOAD  input is held low, the parallel data is loaded synchronously into the register at positive\ngoing transition of the clock pulse.\n The CK-INH input should be shifted high only when the CK input is held high.\n All inputs are equipped with protection circuits against static discharge or transient excess voltage.\n3. Features\n(1) Wide operating temperature range: T opr = -40 to 125 � (Note 1)\n(2) High speed: f MAX = 56 MHz (typ.) at V CC = 5 V\n(3) Low power dissipation: I CC = 4.0 µA (max) at T a = 25 �\n(4) Balanced propagation delays: t PLH ≈ tPHL\n(5) Wide operating voltage range: V CC(opr)  = 2.0 V to 6.0 V\nNote 1: Operating Range spec of T opr = -40 � to 125 � is applicable only for the products which manufactured after\nJuly 2020.\n4.

#### Description:
The **74HC165D** is a high-speed CMOS 8-bit shift register that allows for both parallel and serial data input, with serial data output. It is designed using silicon gate C^2MOS technology, which provides high-speed operation comparable to LSTTL while maintaining low power consumption. The device features gated clock inputs, enabling synchronous loading of parallel data or serial shifting of data based on the state of the SHIFT/LOAD input.

#### Typical Applications:
The 74HC165D is commonly used in various applications, including:
- **Data Acquisition Systems:** For converting parallel data to serial format for easier transmission.
- **Microcontroller Interfaces:** To expand the number of input/output pins available for microcontrollers.
- **LED Control:** For controlling multiple LEDs with fewer microcontroller pins.
- **Communication Systems:** In serial communication protocols where data needs to be shifted in and out efficiently.
- **Digital Signal Processing:** For managing data flow in digital circuits.

This component is ideal for applications requiring efficient data handling and minimal power consumption, making it suitable for battery-operated devices and other low-power applications.
