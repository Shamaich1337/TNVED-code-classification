This feature allows the use of these devices as translators \nin a mixed 3.3-V or 5-V system environment.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nY A\nFigure 8-1. Logic Diagram, Each Inverter (Positive Logic)\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Balanced High-Drive CMOS Push-Pull Outputs\nA balanced output allows the device to sink and source similar currents. The high drive capability of this device \ncreates fast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing. \nAdditionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain without \nbeing damaged. It is important for the power output of the device to be limited to avoid thermal runaway and \ndamage due to over-current. The electrical and thermal limits defined the in the Absolute Maximum Ratings \nsection must be followed at all times.\n8.3.2 CMOS Schmitt-Trigger Inputs\nThis device includes inputs with the Schmitt-trigger architecture. These inputs are high impedance and are \ntypically modeled as a resistor in parallel with the input capacitance given in the Electrical Characteristics  table \nfrom the input to ground. The worst case resistance is calculated with the maximum input voltage, given in the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  table, and the maximum input leakage current, given in the Electrical Characteristics \ntable, using Ohm\'s law (R = V ÷ I).\nThe Schmitt-trigger input architecture provides hysteresis as defined by ΔVT in the Electrical Characteristics \ntable, which makes this device extremely tolerant to slow or noisy inputs. While the inputs can be driven much \nslower than standard CMOS inputs, it is still recommended to properly terminate unused inputs. Driving the \ninputs with slow transitioning signals will increase dynamic current consumption of the device. For additional \ninformation regarding Schmitt-trigger inputs, please see Understanding Schmitt Triggers .\n8.3.3 Clamp Diodes\nThe inputs to this device have negative clamping diodes. The outputs to this device have both positive and \nnegative clamping diodes as shown in Figure 8-2 .\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Absolute Maximum Ratings  table can cause damage to \nthe device. The input negative-voltage and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if the input and \noutput clamp-current ratings are observed.www.ti.comSN54LVC14A, SN74LVC14A\nSCAS285AC – MARCH 1993 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN54LVC14A  SN74LVC14A\nGND Logic Input OutputVCCDevice\n-IIK+IOK\n-IOKFigure 8-2.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nPhysically interactive interface elements like push buttons or rotary knobs offer simple and easy ways to interact \nwith an electronic system. Many of these physical interface elements often have issues with bouncing, or where \nthe physical conductive contact can connect and disconnect multiple times during a button push or release. This \nbouncing can cause one or more faulty transient signals to be passed during this transitional period. These faulty \nsignals can be observed in many common applications: for example, a television remote with bouncing error can \nadjust the TV channel multiple times despite the button being pushed only once. To mitigate these faulty signals, \nuse a Schmitt-trigger, or a device with hysteresis, to remove these faulty signals. Hysteresis allows a device to \nremember  its history, and in this case, the LVC14A uses this memory to debounce the physical element\'s signal, \nor filter the faulty transient signals and pass only the valid signal each time the element is used. In this example, \nwe show a push button signal passed through an LVC14A that is debounced and inverted to the MCU for push \ndetection.\n9.2 Typical Application\nThe signal effects of the debounce circuit can be seen when comparing Figure 9-2  and Figure 9-3 . In Figure 9-2 , \nthe input is a very poor quality signal due to the error in the physical push button. If the MCU attempts to sample \nthis input to detect a push, there is high probability that multiple push events will be falsely detected. Once \nthe debounce circuit has been implemented, the input is cleaned up, and the MCU can perform push detection \nwithout any error, as seen in Figure 9-3 .\nLVC14A\nMCU\n(MSP43x)VCC\n1Y 1AGND\n(x6)VCC = 3.3 V  \nPush Button\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\nFigure 9-1. Debouncer Application Diagram\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nThe SN74LVC14A device uses CMOS technology and has balanced output drive. Take care to avoid bus \ncontention because it can drive currents that would exceed maximum limits.\nThe SN74LVC14A allows for performing logical Boolean functions with hysteresis using digital signals. All input \nsignals should remain as close as possible to either 0 V or V CC for optimal operation.www.ti.comSN54LVC14A, SN74LVC14A\nSCAS285AC – MARCH 1993 – REVISED APRIL 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: SN54LVC14A  SN74LVC14A\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Recommended input conditions:\n•For specified high and low levels, see V IH and V IL in the Recommended Operating Conditions: \nSN74LVC14A  table.\n•Inputs and outputs are overvoltage tolerant and can therefore go as high as 3.6 V at any valid V CC.\n2.Recommended output conditions:\n•Load currents should not exceed ±50 mA.\n3.Frequency selection criterion:\n•Added trace resistance and capacitance can reduce maximum frequency capability; follow the layout \npractices listed in the Layout  section\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nVBUT\nt\nFigure 9-2. Input Response Without Debounce \nCircuit\nVBUT\ntFigure 9-3. Input Response With Debounce Circuit\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating listed in the \nAbsolute Maximum Ratings  table.\nEach V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. For devices with a \nsingle supply, a 0.1-µF bypass capacitor is recommended. If multiple pins are labeled V CC, then a 0.01-µF or \n0.022-µF capacitor is recommended for each V CC because the V CC pins are tied together internally. For devices \nwith dual supply pins operating at different voltages, for example V CC and V DD, a 0.1-µF bypass capacitor is \nrecommended for each supply pin. To reject different frequencies of noise, use multiple bypass capacitors in \nparallel. Capacitors with values of 0.1 µF and 1 µF are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor should \nbe installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results.SN54LVC14A, SN74LVC14A\nSCAS285AC – MARCH 1993 – REVISED APRIL 2022 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN54LVC14A  SN74LVC14A\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-bit logic devices, inputs must never float.\nIn many cases, functions (or parts of functions) of digital logic devices are unused, for example, when only \ntwo inputs of a triple-input AND gate are used or when only 3 of the 4 buffer gates are used. Such input pins \nmust not be left unconnected, because the undefined voltages at the outside connections result in undefined \noperational states. Figure 11-1  specifies the rules that must be observed under all circumstances. All unused \ninputs of digital logic devices must be connected to a high or low bias to prevent them from floating. The logic \nlevel that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the function of the device. Generally they \nare tied to GND or V CC, whichever makes more sense or is more convenient. It is generally acceptable to float \noutputs, unless the part is a transceiver. If the transceiver has an output enable pin, it disables the output section \nof the part when asserted, which does not disable the input section of the I/Os. Therefore, the I/Os cannot float \nwhen disabled.\n11.2 Layout Examples\nVcc\nUnused Input\nInputOutputInput\nUnused Input Output\nFigure 11-1.
