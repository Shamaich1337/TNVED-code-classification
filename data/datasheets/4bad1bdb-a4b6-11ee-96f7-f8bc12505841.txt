It is capable of\ntransforming slowly changing input signals into sharply defined outputs.\nThe input can be driven from either 3.3 V or 5 V devices. This feature allows the use of\nthis device in a mixed 3.3 V and 5 V environment.\nThis device is fully specified for partial power-down applications using I OFF. The I OFF\ncircuitry disables the output, preventing the damaging backflow current through the\ndevice when it is powered down.\n2Features and benefits\n•Wide supply voltage range from 1.65 V to 5.5 V\n•High noise immunity\n•Complies with JEDEC standard\n–JESD8-7 (1.65 V to 1.95 V)\n–JESD8-5 (2.3 V to 2.7 V)\n–JESD8B/JESD36 (2.7 V to 3.6 V)\n•ESD protection:\n–HBM: ANSI/ESDA/JEDEC JS-001 Class 2 exceeds 2000 V\n–MM: JESD22-A115-A exceeds 200 V\n•±24 mA output drive (V CC = 3.0 V)\n•CMOS low power consumption\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 250 mA\n•Direct interface with TTL levels\n•Unlimited rise and fall times\n•Inputs accept voltages up to 5 V\n•Multiple package options\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C and from -40 °C to +125 °C\n3Ordering information\nTable 1.\u2007Ordering information\nPackage Type number\nTemperature range Name Description Version\n74LVC1G17GW -40 °C to +125 °C TSSOP5 plastic thin shrink small outline package;\n5 leads; body width 1.25 mmSOT353-1\n74LVC1G17GV -40 °C to +125 °C SC-74A plastic surface-mounted package; 5 leads SOT753\nNexperia74LVC1G17\nSingle Schmitt trigger buffer\nPackageType number\nTemperature range Name Description Version\n74LVC1G17GM -40 °C to +125 °C XSON6 plastic extremely thin small outline package;\nno leads; 6 terminals; body 1 x 1.45 x 0.5 mmSOT886\n74LVC1G17GF -40 °C to +125 °C XSON6 plastic extremely thin small outline package;\nno leads; 6 terminals; body 1 x 1 x 0.5 mmSOT891\n74LVC1G17GN -40 °C to +125 °C XSON6 extremely thin small outline package; no leads;\n6 terminals; body 0.9 x 1.0 x 0.35 mmSOT1115\n74LVC1G17GS -40 °C to +125 °C XSON6 extremely thin small outline package; no leads;\n6 terminals; body 1.0 x 1.0 x 0.35 mmSOT1202\n74LVC1G17GX -40 °C to +125 °C X2SON5 plastic thermal enhanced extremely thin\nsmall outline package; no leads; 5 terminals;\nbody 0.8 x 0.8 x 0.35 mmSOT1226\n74LVC1G17GX4 -40 °C to +125 °C X2SON4 plastic thermal enhanced extremely thin\nsmall outline package; no leads; 4 terminals;\nbody 0.6 x 0.6 x 0.32 mmSOT1269-2\n4Marking\nTable 2.\u2007Marking codes\nType number Marking [1]\n74LVC1G17GW VJ\n74LVC1G17GV V17\n74LVC1G17GM VJ\n74LVC1G17GF VJ\n74LVC1G17GN VJ\n74LVC1G17GS VJ\n74LVC1G17GX VJ\n74LVC1G17GX4 VJ\n[1]The pin 1 indicator is located on the lower left corner of the device, below the marking code.\n5Functional diagram\nmnb150A Y\nFigure 1.\u2007 Logic symbolmnb151\nFigure 2.\u2007 IEC logic symbol\nmnb152A Y\nFigure 3.\u2007 Logic diagram\n74LVC1G17 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © Nexperia B.V. 2018.

**Description:**
The 74LVC1G17 is a CMOS Schmitt trigger buffer that provides a high-speed buffer function with a Schmitt trigger input. It is designed to improve signal integrity by providing a clean output signal from noisy or slowly changing input signals. The Schmitt trigger action ensures that the output transitions occur at well-defined voltage levels, making it ideal for applications where signal integrity is critical.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Signal Conditioning:** Used in applications where signal integrity needs to be maintained, such as in communication systems.
- **Level Shifting:** Facilitates communication between devices operating at different voltage levels (3.3 V and 5 V).
- **Data Transmission:** Enhances the reliability of data signals in digital circuits.
- **Mixed Voltage Systems:** Suitable for environments where both 3.3 V and 5 V logic levels are present.

This component is particularly valuable in consumer electronics, automotive applications, and industrial control systems where robust signal processing is required.
