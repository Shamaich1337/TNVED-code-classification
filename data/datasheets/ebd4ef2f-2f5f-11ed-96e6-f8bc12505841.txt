The LFCN-2400+ is a ceramic low pass filter designed for RF applications. It operates within a frequency range of DC to 2400 MHz and is suitable for applications requiring harmonic rejection and signal integrity in VHF/UHF transmitters and receivers. The filter is constructed using LTCC (Low-Temperature Co-fired Ceramic) technology, which provides excellent temperature stability and power handling capabilities.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not specified directly; however, the RF power input is rated.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified directly; the focus is on RF power handling.
- **Power Consumption:** RF Power Input: 9 W max at 25°C.
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Storage Temperature Range:** -55°C to 100°C.
- **Package Type:** FV1206 (ceramic package).
- **Special Features:**
  - Excellent power handling (up to 9W).
  - Small size with a compact design.
  - Five-section filter design for enhanced performance.
  - RoHS compliant.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** Not specified in the provided data.

**Typical Applications:**
- **Harmonic Rejection:** Used in systems where unwanted harmonics need to be filtered out to maintain signal integrity.
- **VHF/UHF Transmitters/Receivers:** Ideal for communication systems operating in the VHF and UHF bands.
- **Laboratory Use:** Suitable for experimental setups requiring precise filtering of RF signals.

This low pass filter is particularly useful in applications where DC isolation is required, and coupling capacitors can be used to avoid DC leakage. For applications needing DC pass IN-OUT, a variant with a "D" suffix is available, providing over 100 MΩ isolation to ground. 

Overall, the LFCN-2400+ is a versatile component for RF signal processing, ensuring clean signal transmission in various electronic systems.
