The low ON-state \nresistance of the switch allows connections to be made with minimal propagation delay. The FET multiplexers \nand demultiplexers are disabled when the output-enable (OE) input is high. This device is fully specified for \npartial-power-down applications using I off. The I off feature ensures that damaging current will not backflow \nthrough the device when it is powered down. The device has isolation during power off. To ensure the high-\nimpedance state during power up or power down, OE should be tied to V CC through a pullup resistor; the \nminimum value of the resistor is determined by the current-sinking capability of the driver.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nA\n(OE)B\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe SN74CBTLV3126 features 5- Ω switch connection between ports, allowing for low signal loss across the \nswitch. Rail-to-rail switching on data I/O allows for full voltage swing outputs. I off supports partial-power-down \nmode operation, protecting the chip from voltages at output ports when it is not powered on.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nOne useful application to take advantage of the SN74CBTLV3126 features is isolating various protocols from \na possessor or MCU such as JTAG, SPI, or standard GPIO signals. The device provides excellent isolation \nperformance when the device is powered. The added benefit of powered-off protection allows a system to \nminimize complexity by eliminating the need for power sequencing in hot-swap and live insertion applications.\n9.2 Typical Application\n9.2.1 Protocol / Signal Isolation\nS1  \nS2\nS3  \nS4  Processor\nSEL2\nSEL4\nGNDVDDVDD VI/O\n1.8 V\nLogic I/O SEL3SEL1\nGNDJTAG, SPI, GPIO \nPort\nJTAG \nDEBUG, \nSPI, GPIO  D1\nD2\nD3\nD4FLASH\nRAM\nCPU\nPeripheralsTDI  / CIPO / GPIO\nTDO / COPI / GPIO\nTCK / SCLK / GPIO\nTMS / SS / GPIO0.1 µF\nFigure 9-1.

TI recommended that the digital control pins (OE) be pulled up to V CC or down to GND to avoid \nundesired switch state that could result from the floating pin. All inputs signals passing through the switch must \nfall within the recommend operating conditions of the SN74CBTLV3126 including signal range and continuous \ncurrent. For this design example, with a supply of 3.3 V, the signals can range from 0 V to 3.3 V when the device \nis powered. This example can also utilize the Powered-off Protection feature and the inputs can range from 0 V \nto 3.3 V when V DD = 0 V.\n10 Power Supply Recommendations\nThe power supply can be any voltage between the minimum and maximum supply voltage rating listed in the \nRecommended Operating Conditions table. Each V CC terminal should have a good bypass capacitor to prevent \npower disturbance. For devices with a single supply, a 0.1- μF bypass capacitor is recommended. If multiple pins \nare labeled V CC, then a 0.01- μF or 0.022- μF capacitor is recommended for each V CC because the V CC pins are \ntied together internally. For devices with dual supply pins operating at different voltages, for example V CC and \nVDD, a 0.1-μ F bypass capacitor is recommended for each supply pin. To reject different frequencies of noise, use \nmultiple bypass capacitors in parallel. Capacitors with values of 0.1 μF and 1 μF are commonly used in parallel. \nThe bypass capacitor should be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results.www.ti.comSN74CBTLV3126\nSCDS038K – DECEMBER 1997 – REVISED JUNE 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: SN74CBTLV3126\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen a PCB trace turns a corner at a 90° angle, a reflection can occur. A reflection occurs primarily because of \nthe change of width of the trace. At the apex of the turn, the trace width increases to 1.414 times the width. This \nincrease upsets the transmission-line characteristics, especially the distributed capacitance and self–inductance \nof the trace which results in the reflection. Not all PCB traces can be straight, and therefore; some traces must \nturn corners. Figure 11-1  shows progressively better techniques of rounding corners. Only the last example \n(BEST) maintains constant trace width and minimizes reflections.\nWORST BETTER BEST\n1W min.\nW2W\nFigure 11-1. Trace Example\nRoute the high-speed signals using a minimum of vias and corners which reduces signal reflections and \nimpedance changes. When a via must be used, increase the clearance size around it to minimize its \ncapacitance. Each via introduces discontinuities in the signal’s transmission line and increases the chance of \npicking up interference from the other layers of the board. Be careful when designing test points, through-hole \npins are not recommended at high frequencies.\nDo not route high speed signal traces under or near crystals, oscillators, clock signal generators, switching \nregulators, mounting holes, magnetic devices or ICs that use or duplicate clock signals.\n•Avoid stubs on the high-speed signals traces because they cause signal reflections.\n•Route all high-speed signal traces over continuous GND planes, with no interruptions.\n•Avoid crossing over anti-etch, commonly found with plane splits.\n•When working with high frequencies, a printed circuit board with at least four layers is recommended; two \nsignal layers separated by a ground and power layer as shown in Figure 11-2 .\nSignal 1\nGND Plane\nPower Plane\nSignal 2\nFigure 11-2. Example Layout\nThe majority of signal traces must run on a single layer, preferably Signal 1. Immediately next to this layer \nmust be the GND plane, which is solid with no cuts. Avoid running signal traces across a split in the ground or \npower plane. When running across split planes is unavoidable, sufficient decoupling must be used. Minimizing \nthe number of signal vias reduces EMI by reducing inductance at high frequencies.SN74CBTLV3126\nSCDS038K – DECEMBER 1997 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74CBTLV3126\nFigure 11-3  illustrates an example of a PCB layout with the SN74CBTLV3126. Some key considerations are:\nDecouple the V DD pin with a 0.1- μF capacitor, placed as close to the pin as possible. Make sure that the \ncapacitor voltage rating is sufficient for the V DD supply.\nHigh-speed switches require proper layout and design procedures for optimum performance.\nKeep the input lines as short as possible.\nUse a solid ground plane to help reduce electromagnetic interference (EMI) noise pickup.\nDo not run sensitive analog traces in parallel with digital traces. Avoid crossing digital and analog traces if \npossible, and only make perpendicular crossings when necessary.\n11.2 Layout Example\n2B4A\n3A1OE\n1A\n1B\n2OE\n2AVCC\n4OE\n4B\n3OE\nGNDSN74CBTLV3126C\n3BVia to GND planeWide (low inductance) \ntrace for power\nFigure 11-3.
