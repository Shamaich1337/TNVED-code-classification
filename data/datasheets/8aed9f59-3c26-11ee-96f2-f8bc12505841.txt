Current-feedback input circuitry \nprovides wide bandwidth, even at high gain (70 kHz at \nG = 100).A single external resistor sets any gain from 1 to \n10000. Internal input protection can withstand up to \n±40 V without damage.\nThe INA118 is laser-trimmed for low offset voltage \n(50 µV), drift (0.5 µV/°C), and high common-mode \nrejection (110 dB at G = 1000). The INA118 operates \nwith power supplies as low as ±2.25 V, and quiescent \ncurrent is only 350 µA, making this device an \nexcellent choice for battery-operated systems.\nThe INA118 is available in 8-pin plastic DIP and SO-8 \nsurface-mount packages, and specified for the –40°C \nto +85°C temperature range.\nThe upgraded INA818  offers a lower input stage offset \nvoltage (35 µV, maximum), lower input bias current \n(0.5 nA maximum) and lower noise (8 nV/ √Hz) at the \nsame quiescent current.

Each \ninput is protected by two FET transistors that provide a low series resistance under normal signal conditions, \nthus preserving excellent noise performance. When excessive voltage is applied, these transistors limit input \ncurrent to approximately 6 mA.\nThe differential input voltage is buffered by Q 1 and Q 2 and impressed across R G, causing a signal current to \nflow through R G, R1, and R 2. The output difference amp, A 3, removes the common-mode component of the input \nsignal and refers the output signal to the Ref pin.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\nVD/2\nVD/2 VCM10 µA  10 µA\nA2 A1C1 C2\n40 k \x01\n40 k\x0040 k\x02\n40 k\x03A3 VO\nRef\nR2\n25 k\x04R1\n25 k\x05\nRG\n(External)Q2 Q1VIN\nVIN–VO  = G • (VIN– VIN)+ – –\n+Input Bias Current\nCompensationOutput Swing Range:\n(V+) – 0.8 V to (V–) + 0.35 VVB\n+INA118\nSBOS027C – SEPTEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: INA118\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe INA118 input sections use junction field effect transistors (JFET) connected to provide protection up to \n±40 V. The current-feedback architecture provides maximum bandwidth over the full range of gain settings.\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Noise Performance\nThe INA118 provides low noise in most applications. For differential source impedances less than 1 k Ω, \nthe INA103  may provide lower noise. For source impedances greater than 50 k Ω, the INA111  FET-input \ninstrumentation amplifier may provide lower noise.\nThe low-frequency noise of the INA118 is approximately 0.28 µV PP, measured from 0.1 Hz to 10 Hz (G ≥ 100). \nThe INA118 provides dramatically improved noise performance when compared to state-of-the-art, chopper-\nstabilized amplifiers.\n8.4.2 Input Common-Mode Range\nThe linear input voltage range of the input circuitry of the INA118 is from approximately 1.4-V less than the \npositive supply voltage to 1.2-V greater than the negative supply. As a differential input voltage causes the \noutput voltage to increase, however, the linear input range is limited by the output voltage swing of amplifiers \nA1 and A 2. Thus, the linear common-mode input range is related to the output voltage of the complete amplifier. \nThis behavior also depends on supply voltage; see also Figure 7-6 .\nInput-overload can produce an output voltage that appears normal. For example, if an input overload condition \ndrives both input amplifiers to their positive output swing limit, the difference voltage measured by the output \namplifier is near zero. In this case, the output of the INA118 is near 0 V even though both inputs are overloaded.\n8.4.3 Input Protection\nThe inputs of the INA118 are individually protected for voltages up to ±40 V. For example, a condition of –40 \nV on one input and +40 V on the other input does not cause damage. Internal circuitry on each input provides \nlow series impedance under normal signal conditions. To provide equivalent protection, series input resistors \ncontribute excessive noise. If the input is overloaded, the protection circuitry limits the input current to a safe \nvalue of approximately 6 mA. Figure 7-12  shows this input current limit behavior. The inputs are protected even if \nthe power supplies are disconnected or turned off.www.ti.comINA118\nSBOS027C – SEPTEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: INA118\n9 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe INA118 measures a small differential voltage with a high common-mode voltage developed between the \nnoninverting and inverting input. The high common-mode rejection makes the INA118 an excellent choice for \na wide range of applications. The ability to set the reference pin to adjust the functionality of the output signal \noffers additional flexibility that is practical for multiple configurations.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 9-1  shows the basic connections required for operation of the INA118. Applications with noisy or high \nimpedance power supplies can require decoupling capacitors close to the device pins, as shown. The output is \nreferred to the output reference (Ref) pin, which is normally grounded. This connection must be low-impedance \nto maintain good common-mode rejection. A resistance of 12 Ω in series with the Ref pin causes a typical device \nto degrade to approximately 80-dB CMR (G = 1).\nFigure 9-1  depicts an input signal with a 5-mV, 1-kHz signal with a 1-V PP common-mode signal, a condition often \nobserved in process-control systems.

Industrial process control systems often involve the interconnecting of multiple subsystems; \ntherefore, ground loops are frequently encountered, and often are not easily solved. The inherent common-mode \nrejection of instrumentation amplifiers enables accurate measurements even in the presence of ground-loop \npotentials.\nThe typical application was tested in a system with these requirements:\n•Transducer signal ≈ 5 mV PP\n•Transducer center frequency = 1 kHz\n•Common-mode signal (required to be rejected): 1 V PP at 60 Hz\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n9.2.2.1 Setting the Gain\nAs shown in Equation 1 , the gain of the INA118 is set by connecting a single external resistor, R G, connected \nbetween pins 1 and 8.\nG = 1 +50 \xa0 kΩ\nR G(1)\nCommonly used gains and resistor values are shown in Figure 9-1 .\nThe 50-k Ω term in Equation 1  comes from the sum of the two internal feedback resistors of A 1 and A 2. These \non-chip metal film resistors are laser-trimmed to accurate absolute values. The accuracy and temperature \ncoefficient of these resistors are included in the gain accuracy and drift specifications of the INA118.\nThe stability and temperature drift of the external gain setting resistor, R G, also affects gain. The contribution of \nRG to gain accuracy and drift can be directly inferred from Equation 1 . Low resistor values required for high gain \ncan make wiring resistance important. Sockets add to the wiring resistance, which contributes additional gain \nerror (possibly an unstable gain error) in gains of approximately 100 or greater.\n9.2.2.2 Dynamic Performance\nFigure 7-1  shows that, despite a low quiescent current, the INA118 achieves wide bandwidth, even at high gain. \nThis achievement is due to the current-feedback topology of the INA118. Settling time also remains excellent at \nhigh gain.\nThe INA118 exhibits approximately 3-dB peaking at 500 kHz in unity gain. This peaking is a result of the \ncurrent-feedback topology and is not an indication of instability. Unlike an op amp with poor phase margin, the \nrise in response is a predictable 6-dB/octave due to a zero in the amplifier response. A simple pole at 300 kHz or \nless produces a flat pass-band unity gain response.\n9.2.2.3 Offset Trimming\nThe INA118 is laser-trimmed for low offset voltage and drift. Most applications require no external offset \nadjustment. Figure 9-2  shows an optional circuit for trimming the output offset voltage. The voltage applied \nto the Ref pin is summed at the output. The op amp buffer provides low impedance at the Ref pin to preserve \ngood common-mode rejection.www.ti.comINA118\nSBOS027C – SEPTEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: INA118\n10kΩOPA177\n±10mV\nAdjustment Range100Ω\n100Ω100µA\n1/2 REF200\n100µA\n1/2 REF200V+\nV–RG INA118\nRefVOVIN–\nVIN+Figure 9-2. Optional Trimming of Output Offset Voltage\n9.2.2.4 Input Bias Current Return Path\nThe input impedance of the INA118 is extremely high at approximately 1010 Ω. However, a path must be \nprovided for the input bias current of both inputs. This input bias current is approximately ±5 nA. High input \nimpedance means that this input bias current changes very little with varying input voltage.\nInput circuitry must provide a path for this input bias current for proper operation. Figure 9-3  shows various \nprovisions for an input bias current path. Without a bias current path, the inputs float to a potential which \nexceeds the common-mode range of the INA118, and the input amplifiers saturates.\nIf the differential source resistance is low, the bias current return path can be connected to one input (see \nthe thermocouple example in Figure 9-3 ). With higher source impedance, using two equal resistors provides \na balanced input, with the possible advantages of lower input offset voltage due to bias current, and better \nhigh-frequency common-mode rejection.\nINA118\n47kΩ 47kΩ\nINA118\n10kΩMicrophone,\nHydrophone\netc.\nThermocouple\nINA118\nCenter-tap provides\nbias current return.\nFigure 9-3.

Performance of the INA118 remains excellent with \npower supplies ranging from ±2.25 V to ±18 V. Most parameters vary only slightly throughout this supply voltage \nrange; see also Section 7.6. Operation at low supply voltage requires careful attention to make sure that the \ninput voltages remain within the respective linear range. Voltage swing requirements of internal nodes limit the \ninput common-mode range with low power supply voltage.

Figure 9-10  shows a basic single-supply \ncircuit. The output Ref pin is connected to ground. Zero differential input voltage demands an output voltage of \n0 V (ground). The actual output voltage swing is limited to approximately 35-mV above ground, when the load is \nreferred to ground as shown. Figure 7-15  shows how the output voltage swing varies with output current.\nWith single supply operation, V+ IN and V– IN must be 1.2-V greater than ground for linear operation. Connecting \nthe inverting input to ground and measuring a voltage connected to the noninverting input is not possible.\nTo illustrate the issues affecting low-voltage operation, consider the circuit in Figure 9-10 , which shows the \nINA118 operating from a single 5-V supply. Depending on the desired gain, a resistor in series with the high side \nof the bridge can be required to make sure that the bridge output voltage is within the common-mode range of \nthe amplifier inputs. See Figure 7-5  for 5-V single supply operation.\n300 \x015 V\nR1  (1)\n2.5V – DV\n2.5V + DV\nNOTE: (1) R1may be required to create proper common-mode  \nvoltage, for low voltage operation with certain gains — see text.5 V\nRGINA118 VO\nRef\nFigure 9-10. Single-Supply Bridge Amplifier\n9.4 Layout\n9.4.1 Layout Guidelines\nTI always recommends paying attention to good layout practices. For best operational performance of the \ndevice, use good printed-circuit-board (PCB) layout practices, including:\n•Make sure that both input paths are well-matched for source impedance and capacitance to avoid converting \ncommon-mode signals into differential signals. In addition, parasitic capacitance at the gain-setting pins can \nalso affect CMRR over frequency. For example, in applications that implement gain switching using switches \nor PhotoMOS® relays to change the value of R G, select the component so that the switch capacitance is as \nsmall as possible.\n•Noise can propagate into analog circuitry through the power pins of the circuit as a whole, and of the \nindividual device. Bypass capacitors are used to reduce the coupled noise by providing low-impedance power \nsources local to the analog circuitry. Connect low-ESR, 0.1-μF ceramic bypass capacitors between each \nsupply pin and ground, placed as close to the device as possible. A single bypass capacitor from V+ to \nground is applicable for single-supply applications.\n•Separate grounding for analog and digital portions of the circuitry is one of the simplest and most effective \nmethods of noise suppression. One or more layers on multilayer PCBs are usually devoted to ground planes. \nA ground plane helps distribute heat and reduces EMI noise pickup. Make sure to physically separate digital \nand analog grounds, paying attention to the flow of the ground current.\n•To reduce parasitic coupling, run the input traces as far away from the supply or output traces as possible. \nIf these traces cannot be kept separate, crossing the sensitive trace perpendicular is much better than in \nparallel with the noisy trace.\n•Keep the traces as short as possible.www.ti.comINA118\nSBOS027C – SEPTEMBER 2000 – REVISED SEPTEMBER 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: INA118\n9.4.2 Layout Example\nRG\nV+\nVO\nRefRG\nV-IN\nV+IN\nV-VIN\nVIN-\n+\nV- GNDBypass\nCapacitorGain Resistor\nBypass\nCapacitor\nGNDV+\nVOUT\nFigure 9-11.
