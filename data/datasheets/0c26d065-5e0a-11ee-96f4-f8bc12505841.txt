!==============================================================================!
Based on the provided information regarding the stainless steel 316 tube with dimensions 4x0.2x465mm from DG RGP INDUSTRIAL ELECTRICAL, here is a concise summary of the key characteristics and specifications:

### Key Specifications:
- **Material**: Stainless Steel 316
- **Dimensions**: 
  - Outer Diameter: 4 mm
  - Wall Thickness: 0.2 mm
  - Length: 465 mm
- **Tolerance**: ±1 mm on length
- **Corrosion Resistance**: Excellent resistance to corrosion, particularly in chloride environments.
- **Temperature Resistance**: Suitable for high-temperature applications, typically up to 870°C (1600°F) in continuous service.
- **Moisture Sensitivity**: Not applicable as this is a metal tube, but stainless steel 316 is generally resistant to moisture and oxidation.

### Description:
The stainless steel 316 tube is a cylindrical hollow section made from 316-grade stainless steel, which is known for its superior corrosion resistance and strength. This type of stainless steel contains molybdenum, which enhances its resistance to pitting and crevice corrosion in chloride environments. The tube is characterized by its small outer diameter and thin wall thickness, making it suitable for applications where space and weight are critical.

### Typical Applications:
- **Medical Equipment**: Used in the manufacture of medical devices and instruments due to its biocompatibility and resistance to sterilization processes.
- **Food and Beverage Industry**: Commonly used in food processing and storage applications, where hygiene and corrosion resistance are paramount.
- **Chemical Processing**: Ideal for piping and tubing in chemical plants, especially where aggressive chemicals are handled.
- **Marine Applications**: Utilized in marine environments for components that require resistance to saltwater corrosion.
- **Aerospace and Automotive**: Employed in lightweight structural components and systems that require high strength and corrosion resistance.

This stainless steel tube is a versatile component suitable for a wide range of industrial applications, particularly where durability and resistance to harsh environments are required.
