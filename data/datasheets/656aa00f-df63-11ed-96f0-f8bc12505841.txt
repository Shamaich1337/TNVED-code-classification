Motor power is provided by external \nN-channel power MOSFETs at supply voltages from 12 to 50 V .\nThis device contains two sinusoidal DACs that generate the \nreference voltage for two separate fixed off-time PWM current \ncontrollers. These provide current regulation for external power \nMOSFET full bridges.\nMotor stepping is controlled by a two-wire step and direction \ninterface, providing complete microstepping control at full-, \nhalf-, quarter-, and sixteenth-step resolutions. The fixed-off \ntime regulator has the ability to operate in slow-, mixed-, or \nfast-decay modes, which results in reduced audible motor \nnoise, increased step accuracy, and reduced power dissipation.\nThe translator is the key to the easy implementation of this \nIC. Simply inputting one pulse on the STEP input drives the \nmotor one step (full, half, quarter, or sixteenth depending \non the microstep select input). There are no phase-sequence \ntables, high frequency control lines, or complex interfaces to \nprogram. This reduces the need for a complex microcontroller.\nFEATURES AND BENEFITS\n▪\t2-wire step and direction interface\n▪\t Dual\tfull-bridge\tgate\tdrive\tfor\tN-channel\tMOSFETs\n▪\t Operation\tover\t12\tto\t50\t V\tsupply\tvoltage\trange\n▪\t Synchronous\trectification\n▪\t Cross-conduction\tprotection\n▪\t Adjustable\tmixed\tdecay\n▪\t Integrated\tsinusoidal\tDAC\tcurrent\treference\n▪\t Fixed\toff-time\tPWM\tcurrent\tcontrol\n▪\t Enhanced\tlow\tcurrent\tcontrol\twhen\tmicrostepping\n▪\t Pin\tcompatible\twith\tthe\t A3986\nApril 3, 2023\nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA49892\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comThe above-supply voltage required for the high-side N-channel \nMOSFETs is provided by a bootstrap capacitor.

It is designed to operate 2-phase bipolar stepper motors in \nfull-, half-, quarter, and sixteenth-step modes. The current in each \nof the two external power full-bridges, all N-channel MOSFETs, \nis independently regulated by a fixed off-time PWM control \ncircuit. The full-bridge current at each step is set by the value of \nan external current sense resistor, RSENSE X , in the ground connec -\ntion to the bridge, a reference voltage, VREF, and the output of the \nDAC controlled by the translator.\nThe use of PWM with N-channel MOSFETs provides the most \ncost-effective solution for a high efficiency motor drive. The \nA4989 provides all the necessary circuits to ensure that the gate-\nsource voltage of both high-side and low-side external MOSFETs \nare above 10 V , and that there is no cross-conduction (shoot \nthrough) in the external bridge.\nSpecific functions are described more fully in the following sec -\ntions.\nPower Supplies\nTwo power connections are required. The motor power supply \nshould be connected to VBB  to provide the gate drive levels. \nPower for internal logic is provided by the VDD input. Internal \nlogic is designed to operate from 3 to 5.5 V , allowing the use of \n3.3 or 5 V external logic interface circuits.\nGND.  The ground pin is a reference voltage for internal logic and \nanalog circuits. There is no large current flow through this pin. \nTo avoid any noise from switching circuits, this should have an \nindependent trace to the supply ground star point.\nVREG.  The voltage at this pin is generated by a low-drop-out \nlinear regulator from the VBB supply. It is used to operate the \nlow-side gate drive outputs, GL xx, and to provide the charging \ncurrent for the bootstrap capacitors, CBOOT x. To limit the volt -\nage drop when the charge current is provided, this pin should be \ndecoupled with a ceramic capacitor, CREG, to ground. The value \nCREG should typically be 40 times the value of the bootstrap capacitor for PWM frequencies up to 14 kHz. Above 14 kHz, the \nminimum recommended value can be determined from the fol -\nlowing formula:\nCREG > CBOOT  × 3 × fPWM ,\nwhere CREG and CBOOT  are in nF, and fPWM is the maximum \nPWM frequency, in kHz. VREG is monitored, and if the voltage \nbecomes too low, the outputs will be disabled.\nREF.  The reference voltage, VREF, at this pin sets the maximum \n(100%) peak current. The REF  input is internally limited to \n2 V when a 20 k Ω pull-up resistor is connected between VREF \nand VDD . This allows the maximum reference voltage to be set \nwithout the need for an externally generated voltage. An external \nreference voltage below the maximum can also be input on this \npin. The voltage at VREF is divided by 8 to produce the DAC \nreference voltage level.\nOSC.  The internal FET control timing is derived from a master \nclock running at  4 MHz typical. A resistor, ROSC, connected \nfrom the OSC pin to GND sets the frequency (in MHz) to \napproximately:\nfOSC ≈\t100\t/\t(6\t+\t1.9\t×\tROSC) ,\nwhere ROSC, in k Ω, is typically between 50 k Ω and 10 k Ω. The \nmaster oscillator period is used to derive the PWM off-time, dead \ntime, and blanking time.\nGate Drive\nThe A4989 is designed to drive external power N-channel \nMOSFETs. It supplies the transient currents necessary to quickly \ncharge and discharge the external FET gate capacitance in order \nto reduce dissipation in the external FET during switching. The \ncharge and discharge rate can be controlled using an external \nresistor , RGx, in series with the connection to the gate of the \nFET. Cross-conduction is prevented by the gate drive circuits \nwhich introduce a dead time, tDEAD  , between switching one FET \noff and the complementary FET on. tDEAD  is at least three periods \nof the master oscillator but can be up to one cycle longer to allow \noscillator synchronization.\nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA498911\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comC1A,  C1B, C2A, and C2B.  High-side connections for the \nbootstrap capacitors, CBOOT x, and positive supply for high-side \ngate drivers. The bootstrap capacitors are charged to approxi -\nmately VREG when the associated output S xx terminal is low. \nWhen the output swings high, the voltage on this terminal rises \nwith the output to provide the boosted gate voltage needed for the \nhigh-side N-channel power MOSFETs. The bootstrap capacitor \nshould be ceramic and have a value of 10 to 20 times the total \nMOSFET gate capacitance.\nGH1A, GH1B, GH2A, and GH2B.  High-side gate drive \noutputs for external  N-channel MOSFETs. External series gate \nresistors can be used to  control the slew rate seen at the gate, \nthereby  controlling the di/dt and dv/dt at the motor terminals.  \nGHxx = 1 (high) means that the upper half of the  driver is turned \non and will source current to the gate  of the high-side MOSFET \nin the external motor-driving bridge. GH xx = 0 (low) means that \nthe lower half of the driver  is turned on and will sink current from \nthe external  MOS FET’s gate circuit to the respective S xx pin.\nS1A, S1B, S2A, and S2B.  Directly connected to the motor, \nthese terminals  sense the voltages switched across the load and \ndefine the negative supply for the floating  high-side drivers. The \ndischarge current from the high-side MOSFET gate capacitance \nflows through these connections which should have low imped -\nance traces to the MOSFET bridge.\nGL1A, GL1B, GL2A, and GL2B.  Low-side gate drive outputs \nfor external  N-channel MOSFETs. External series gate resistors \n(as close as  possible to the MOSFET gate) can be used to reduce \nthe slew rate  seen at the gate, thereby controlling the di/dt and dv/\ndt at the motor terminals. GL xx = 1 (high) means that  the upper \nhalf of the driver is turned on and will source current to the gate \nof the low-side MOSFET in the  external motor-driving bridge. \nGLxx = 0 (low) means that  the lower half of the driver is turned \non and will sink current from the gate of the external MOSFET to \nthe LSS x pin.\nLSS1 and LSS2.  Low-side return path for discharge of the gate \ncapacitors, connected to the common sources of the low-side \nexternal FETs through low-impedance traces .\nMotor Control\nMotor speed and direction is controlled simply by two logic inputs, and the microstep level is controlled by a further two \nlogic inputs. At power-up or reset, the translator sets the DACs \nand phase current polarity to the initial Home state (see figures 2 \nthrough 5 for home-state conditions) and sets the current regula -\ntor for both phases to mixed-decay mode. When a step command \nsignal occurs on the STEP input, the translator automatically \nsequences the DACs to the next level (see table 3 for the current \nlevel sequence and current polarity).\nThe microstep resolution is set by inputs MS1 and MS2 as shown \nin table 1. If the new DAC level is higher or equal to the previ -\nous level, then the decay mode for that full-bridge will normally \nbe slow decay. If the new DAC output level is lower than the \nprevious level, the decay mode for that full bridge will be set by \nthe PFD1 and PFD2 inputs. The full range of settings available is \ngiven in table 2. This automatic current-decay selection improves \nmicrostepping performance by reducing the distortion of the cur -\nrent waveform due to the motor BEMF.\nSTEP.  A low-to-high transition on the STEP input sequences the \ntranslator and advances the motor one increment. The translator \ncontrols the input to the DACs as well as the direction of current \nflow in each winding. The size of the increment is determined by \nthe state of the MS x inputs.\nMS1 and MS2. These Microstep Select inputs are used to \nselect the microstepping format, per table 1. Changes to these \ninputs do not take effect until the next STEP input rising edge.\nDIR.  This Direction input determines the direction of rotation of \nthe motor. When low, the direction is “clockwise” and “counter -\nclockwise” when high. A change on this input does not take effect \nuntil the next STEP rising edge.\nInternal PWM Current Control\nEach full-bridge is independently controlled by a fixed off-time \nPWM current control circuit that limits the load current in the \nphase to a desired value, ITRIP. Initially, a diagonal pair of source \nand sink MOSFETs are enabled and current flows through the \nmotor winding and the current sense resistor, RSENSE x. When \nthe voltage across  RSENSE x equals the DAC output voltage, the \ncurrent sense comparator resets the PWM latch, which turns off \nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA498912\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comthe source MOSFET (slow decay mode) or the sink and source \nMOSFETs (fast decay mode). The maximum value of current \nlimiting is set by the selection of RSENSE  and the voltage at the \nREF input, with a transconductance function approximated by:\nITRIP(max)  = VREF /\t(8\t×\t RSENSE )\nThe DAC, controlled by the translator, reduces the reference \nvoltage, VREF , in precise steps to produce the required sinusoidal \nreference levels for the current sense comparator. This limits the \nphase current trip level, ITRIP, to a portion of the maximum cur -\nrent level, ITRIP(max) , defined by:\nITRIP = (% ITRIP(max) /\t100)\t×\t ITRIP(max)\nSee table 3 for % ITRIP(max)  at each step.\nFixed Off-Time.  The internal PWM current control circuitry \nuses the master oscillator to control the length of time the power \nMOSFETs remain off. The off-time, tOFF , is nominally 87 cycles \nof the master oscillator (21.75 µs at 4 MHz), but may be up to 1 \ncycle longer to synchronize with the master oscillator.\nBlanking.  This function blanks the output of the current sense \ncomparator when the outputs are switched by the internal current \ncontrol. The comparator output is blanked to prevent false over -\ncurrent detection due to reverse recovery currents of the clamp \ndiodes and switching transients related to the capacitance of the \nload. The blank time, tBLANK\t,\tis\t6\tcycles\tof\tthe\tmaster\toscillator\t\n(1.5 µs at 4 MHz). Because the tBLANK  follows the end of tOFF, no \nsynchronization error occurs.\nDead Time.  To prevent cross-conduction (shoot through) in the \npower full-bridge, a dead time is introduced between switching \none MOSFET off and switching the complementary MOSFET \non. The dead time, tDEAD , is 3 cycles of the master oscillator (750 \nns at 4MHz), but may be up to 1 cycle longer to synchronize with \nthe master oscillator.\nENABLE. This input simply turns off all the power MOSFETs. \nWhen set at logic high, the outputs are disabled. When set at logic \nlow, the internal control enables the outputs as required. Inputs \nto the translator (STEP, DIR, MS1, and MS2) and the internal \nsequencing logic are all active independent of the ENABLE input \nstate.\nRESET. An active-low control input  used to minimize power consumption when not in use.  This disables much of the internal \ncircuitry, including the  output MOSFETs and internal  regulator. \nWhen set at logic high,  allows normal operation and start-up of \nthe device in the  home position. When coming out of sleep mode, \nwait 1 ms before issuing a STEP command, to allow the internal \nregulator to stabilize. The outputs can also be reset to the home \nposition without entering sleep mode. To do so, pulse the RESET \ninput low, with a pulse width between twR(min)  and twR(max) .\nMixed Decay Operation\nMixed decay is a technique that provides greater control of phase \ncurrents while the current is decreasing. When a stepper motor \nis driven at high speed, the back EMF from the motor will lag \nbehind the driving current. If a passive current decay mode, \nsuch as slow decay, is used in the current control scheme, then \nthe motor back EMF can cause the phase current to rise out of \ncontrol. Mixed decay eliminates this effect by putting the full-\nbridge initially into fast decay, and then switching to slow decay \nafter some time. Because fast decay is an active (driven) decay \nmode, this portion of the current decay cycle will ensure that the \ncurrent remains in control. Using fast decay for the full current \ndecay time (off-time) would result in a large ripple current, but \nswitching to slow decay once the current is in control will reduce \nthe ripple current value. The portion of the off-time that the full-\nbridge has to remain in fast decay will depend on the characteris -\ntics and the speed of the motor. \nWhen the magnitude of the phase current is rising, the motor \nback EMF will not affect the current control and slow decay \nmay be used to minimize the  phase current ripple. The A4989 \nautomatically switches between slow decay, when the current is \nrising, and mixed decay, when the current magnitude is falling. \nThe portion of the off-time that the full-bridge remains in fast \ndecay is defined by the PFD1 and PFD2 inputs. However, when \nhigh VBB voltages are used with motors having low values of \nDC phase resistance, the minimum current that can be controlled \ncan be higher than the target value required in some microstep -\nping modes. Errors in the average current amplitude delivered to \nthe phases of a motor can lead to positional errors in the holding \ncondition\tand/or\texcessive\ttorque\tripple\tand\tacoustic\tnoise\tat\tlow\t\nspeeds.\nThe conditions for the loss of current control due to this effect are \njust\tafter\ta\tcurrent\tzero\tcrossing,\tas\tthe\tmagnitude\tof\tthe\tcur -\nrent increases.

Because the requirements are \nclosely related to the microstep settings used, the relationship \nbetween MSx and PFDx is tabulated in table 2 for clarity.\nThe overall result is an extension of the minimum current control \nrange the 4989 can achieve. The effect can be seen clearly in \nfigures\t6\tand\t7,\tbelow.\nPFD1 and PFD2.  The Percent Fast Decay pins are used to select the portion of fast decay, according to table 2, to be used \nwhen mixed decay is enabled. Mixed decay is enabled when a \nSTEP input signal commands an output current that is lower than \nfor the previous step. In mixed decay mode, as the trip point is \nreached, the A4989 goes into fast decay mode until the specified \nnumber of master oscillator cycles has completed. After this fast \ndecay portion, the A4989 switches to slow decay mode for the \nremainder of the fixed off-time, tOFF.\nFigure 6.

This option \ncan be used to keep the phase current ripple to a minimum when \nthe motor is stationary or stepping at very low rates.\nSelecting 100% fast decay will provide the fastest current control \nwhen the current is falling and can help when the motor is being \ndriven at very high step rates.\nSR. Input used to set synchronous rectification mode. When a \nPWM off-cycle is triggered, load current recirculates according \nto the decay mode selected by the control logic. The synchronous \nrectification feature turns on the appropriate MOSFETs during \nthe current decay and effectively shorts out the body diodes with \nthe low RDS(ON)  of the MOSFET. This lowers power dissipa -\ntion significantly and eliminates the need for additional Schottky \ndiodes. Synchronous rectification can be set to either active mode \nor disabled mode.• Active Mode  When the SR pin input is logic low, active mode \nis enabled and synchronous rectification will occur. This mode \nprevents reversal of the load current by turning off synchro -\nnous rectification when a zero current level is detected. This \nprevents the motor winding from conducting in the reverse \ndirection.\n• Disabled Mode When the SR pin input is logic high, synchro -\nnous rectification is disabled. This mode is typically used when \nexternal diodes are required to transfer power dissipation from \nthe power MOSFETs to external, usually Schottky, diodes.\nShutdown Operation.  In the event of an overtemperature \nfault, or an undervoltage fault on VREG, the MOSFETs are \ndisabled until the fault condition is removed. At power-up, and \nin the event of low voltage at VDD, the undervoltage lockout \n(UVLO) circuit disables the MOSFETs until the voltage at VDD \nreaches the minimum level. Once VDD is above the minimum \nlevel, the translator is reset to the home state, and the MOSFETs \nare reenabled.\nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA498915\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comAPPLICATION INFORMATION\nCurrent Sensing\nTo minimize inaccuracies in sensing the IPEAK  current level \ncaused by ground-trace IR drops, the sense resistor, RSENSE x, \nshould have an independent return to the supply ground star \npoint . For low-value sense resistors, the IR drops in the sense \nresistor PCB traces can be significant and should be taken into \naccount. The use of sockets should be avoided as they can intro -\nduce variation in RSENSE x due to their contact resistance.\nThermal Protection\nAll\tdrivers\tare\tturned\toff\twhen\tthe\tjunction\ttemperature\treaches\t\n165°C\t\ttypical.\t This\tis\tintended\tonly\tto\tprotect\tthe\t A4989\tfrom\t\nfailures\tdue\tto\texcessive\tjunction\ttemperatures.\t Thermal\tprotec -\ntion will not protect the A4989 from continuous short circuits. \nThermal\tshutdown\thas\ta\thysteresis\tof\tapproximately\t15°C.\nCircuit Layout \nBecause this is a switch-mode application, where rapid current \nchanges are present, care must be taken during layout of the \napplication PCB. The following points are provided as guidance \nfor layout. Following all guidelines will not always be possible. \nHowever, each point should be carefully considered as part of \nany layout procedure.\nGround connection layout recommendations:\n1. Decoupling capacitors for the supply pins VBB, VREG, and \nVDD should be connected independently close to the GND pin \nand not to any ground plane. The decoupling capacitors should \nalso be connected as close as possible to the corresponding sup -\nply pin.\n2. The oscillator timing resistor ROSC should be connected to the \nGND pin. It should not be connected to any ground plane, supply common, or the power ground.\n3. The GND pin should be connected by an independent low \nimpedance trace to the supply common at a single point.\n4. Check the peak voltage excursion of the transients on the LSS \npin with reference to the GND pin using a close grounded (tip \nand barrel) probe. If the voltage at LSS exceeds the absolute \nmaximum specified in this datasheet, add additional clamping, \ncapacitance, or both between the LSS pin and the AGND pin.\nOther layout recommendations:\n1. Gate charge drive paths and gate discharge return paths may \ncarry transient current pulses. Therefore, the traces from GH xx, \nGLxx, Sxx, and LSS x should be as short as possible to reduce the \ninductance of the circuit trace.\n2. Provide an independent connection from each LSS pin to the \ncommon point of each power bridge. It is not recommended to \nconnect LSS directly to the GND pin. The LSS connection should \nnot be used for the SENSE connection.\n3. Minimize stray inductance by using short, wide copper runs at \nthe drain and source terminals of all power FETs. This includes \nmotor lead connections, the input power bus, and the common \nsource of the low-side power FETs. This will minimize voltages \ninduced by fast switching of large load currents.\n4. Consider the use of small (100 nF) ceramic decoupling capaci -\ntors across the source and drain of the power FETs to limit fast \ntransient voltage spikes caused by trace inductance.\nThe above are only recommendations. Each application is differ -\nent and may encounter different sensitivities. Each design should \nbe tested at the maximum current, to ensure any parasitic effects \nare eliminated.\nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA498916\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comTerminal List Table\nNumber Name Description\n1 C2A Phase 2 bootstrap capacitor drive A  connection\n2 GH2A Phase 2 high-side gate drive A\n3 S2A Phase 2 motor connection A\n4 GL2A Phase 2 low-side gate drive A\n5 NC No internal connection\n6 VREG Regulator decoupling capacitor  connection\n7 VBB Motor supply voltage\n8 GL1A Phase 1 low-side gate drive A\n9 S1A Phase 1 motor connection A\n10 GH1A Phase 1 high-side gate drive A\n11 C1A Phase 1 bootstrap capacitor drive A connection\n12 C1B Phase 1 bootstrap capacitor drive B connection\n13 GH1B Phase 1 high-side gate drive B\n14 S1B Phase 1 motor connection B\n15 GL1B Phase 1 low-side gate drive B\n16 LSS1 Phase 1 low-side source connection\n17 SENSE1 Phase 1 bridge current sense input\n18 SR Synchronous rectification enable\n19 ENABLE Output enable\n20 GND Ground\n21 REF Reference voltage\n22 RESET Reset input\n23 OSC Oscillator input, ROSC resistor connection\n24 NC No internal connection\n25 VDD Logic supply voltage\n26 STEP Step input\n27 PFD2 Percent Fast Decay input 2\n28 MS1 Microstep Select input 1\n29 MS2 Microstep Select input 2\n30 DIR Direction input\n31 PFD1 Percent Fast Decay input 1\n32 SENSE2 Phase 2 bridge current sense input\n33 LSS2 Phase 2 low-side source connection\n34 NC No internal connection\n35 GL2B Phase 2 low-side gate drive B\n36 S2B Phase 2 motor connection B\n37 GH2B Phase 2 high-side gate drive B\n38 C2B Phase 2 bootstrap capacitor drive B  connection 7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n1365\n30\n29\n28\n27\n26\n25\n243132\n15\n16\n17\n18141\n2\n3\n4\n22\n21\n20 192336\n3538\n37\n34\n33\nSENSE2\nPFD1\nDIR\nMS2\nMS1\nPFD2\nSTEP\nVDD\nNCNC\nVREG\nVBB\nGL1A\nS1A\nGH1A\nC1A\nC1B\nGH1B\nS1B\nGL1B\nLSS1\nSENSE1\nSR\nENABLEC2A\nGH2A\nS2A\nGL2AS2B\nGL2B\nNC\nLSS2\nOSC\nRESET\nREF\nGNDGH2BC2B\nControl \nLogic\nTranslatorPinout Diagram\nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA498917\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comLD Package, 38-Pin TSSOP\n1.20 MAX8°\n0°\n 6.00 1.60\nSEATING\nPLANE0.50\nC 0.1038× C 0.30\n0.15\n0.0250.27\n0.174.40 ±0.10 6.40 ±0.20 9.70 ±0.10 \n0.20\n0.09\n2138\n2138\nGAUGE PLANESEATING PLANEA\nATerminal #1 mark area\nCB\nBReference pad layout (reference IPC SOP50P640X110-38M)\nAll pads a minimum of 0.20 mm from all adjacent pads; adjust as necessary \nto meet application process requirements and PCB layout tolerancesPCB Layout Reference View\n0.50 BSC0.25 BSC0.60 ±0.15\nCStandard Branding Reference\nBranding scale and appearance at supplier discretionXXXXXXXXX\nDate Code\nLot Number\nLines 1, 2, 3 = 13 characters. \nLine 1: Part Number \nLine 2: Logo A, 4 digit Date Code \nLine 3: First 8 characters of Assembly Lot NumberFor Reference Only –Not for T ooling Use\n(Reference Allegro DWG-0000381, Rev. 1 and JEDEC MO-153 BD-1)\nDimensions in millimeters\nNOT TO SCALE\nExact case and lead conﬁguration at supplier discretion within limits shown\nDual Full-Bridge MOSFET Driver  \nwith Microstepping TranslatorA498918\nAllegro MicroSystems \n955 Perimeter Road \nManchester, NH 03103-3353 U.S.A.\nwww.allegromicro.comRevision History\nNumber Date Description\n2 April 10, 2020 Minor editorial updates\n3 April 5, 2022 Updated package drawing (page 17)\n4 April 3, 2023 Minor editorial updates\nFor the latest version of this document, visit our website:\nwww.allegromicro.comCopyright 2023, Allegro MicroSystems.\nAllegro MicroSystems reserves the right to make, from time to time, such departures from the detail specifications as may be required to permit \nimprovements in the performance, reliability, or manufacturability of its products.
