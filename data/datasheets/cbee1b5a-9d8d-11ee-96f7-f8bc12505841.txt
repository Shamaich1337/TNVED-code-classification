overshoot. Foradetailed overview oftheFlat-Clamp family ofdevices,\nplease reference TI\'sFlat-Clamp surge protection technology forefficient system protection white paper. This\ndocument explains indetail thefunctional operation ofthedevices and how they impact and improve system\ndesign.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\nThe TVS1400 isaprecision clamp that handles 43AofIEC 61000-4-5 8/20 µssurge pulse. The flatclamping\nfeature helps keep theclamping voltage very lowtokeep thedownstream circuits from being stressed. The flat\nclamping feature canalso help end-equipment designers save cost byopening upthepossibility touselower-\ncost lower voltage tolerant downstream ICs. The TVS1400 hasminimal leakage under thestandoff voltage of14\nV,making itanideal candidate forapplications where lowleakage and power dissipation isanecessity. IEC\n61000-4-2 and IEC 61000-4-4 ratings make itarobust protection solution forESD and EFT events. Wide\nambient temperature range of–40°Cto+125 °Cmakes itagood candidate formost applications. Compact\npackages enable ittobeused insmall devices andsave board area.\n8.4 Reliability Testing\nToensure device reliability, theTVS1400 ischaracterized against 5000 repetitive pulses of35AIEC61000-4-5\n8/20 µssurge pulses at125°C.The test isperformed with less than 10seconds between each pulse athigh\ntemperature tosimulate worst case scenarios forfault regulation. After each surge pulse, theTVS1400 clamping\nvoltage, breakdown voltage, and leakage arerecorded toensure that there isnovariation orperformance\ndegradation. Byensuring robust, reliable, high temperature protection, theTVS1400 enables fault protection in\napplications thatmust withstand years ofcontinuous operation with noperformance change.\n10TVS1400\nSLVSED3A –DECEMBER 2017 –REVISED MARCH 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TVS1400Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2017 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated8.5 Device Functional Modes\n8.5.1 Protection Specifications\nThe TVS1400 isspecified according toboth theIEC 61000-4-5 and IEC 61643-321 standards. This enables\nusage insystems regardless ofwhich standard isrequired inrelevant product standards orbest matches\nmeasured fault conditions. The IEC61000-4-5 standard requires protection against apulse with arisetime of8\nµsandahalflength of20µswhile theIEC61643-321 standard requires protection against amuch longer pulse\nwith arisetime of10µsandahalflength of1000 µs.\nThe positive and negative surges areimposed totheTVS1400 byacombinational waveform generator (CWG)\nwith a2-Ωcoupling resistor atdifferent peak voltage levels. Forpowered ontransient tests that need power\nsupply bias, inductances areusually used todecouple thetransient stress and protect thepower supply. The\nTVS01400 ispost tested byguaranteeing thatthere isnoshift indevice breakdown orleakage atVrwm.\nInaddition, theTVS1400 hasbeen tested according toIEC61000-4-5 topass a±2kVsurge testthrough a42-Ω\ncoupling resistor anda0.5µFcapacitor. This testisacommon testrequirement forindustrial signal I/Olines and\ntheTVS1400 willserve anideal protection solution forapplications with thatrequirement.\nThe TVS1400 also integrates IEC61000-4-2 Level 4ESD Protection and80AofIEC61000-4-4 EFT Protection.\nThese combine toensure thatthedevice isable toprotect against alltransient conditions regardless oflength or\ntype.\nFormore information onTI\'s test methods forSurge, ESD, and EFT testing, reference TI\'sIEC 61000-4-x\nTesting Application Note .\n8.5.2 Minimal Derating\nUnlike traditional diodes The TVS1400 has very little derating ofmax power dissipation and ensures robust\nperformance upto125°C,shown inFigure 8.Traditional TVS diodes lose upto50% oftheir current carrying\ncapability when athigh temperatures, soasurge pulse above 85°Cambient cancause failures thatarenotseen\natroom temperature. The TVS1400 prevents thisand ensures that you willsee thesame level ofprotection\nregardless oftemperature.\n8.5.3 Transient Performance\nDuring large transient swings, the TVS1400 will begin clamping the input signal toprotect downstream\nconditions. While thisprevents damage during fault conditions, itcan cause leakage when theintended input\nsignal hasafastslew rate. Inorder tokeep power dissipation lowandremove thechance ofsignal distortion, it\nisrecommended tokeep theslew rate ofanyinput signal ontheTVS1400 below 2.5V/µsatroom temperature\nand below 0.7V/µsat125°Casshown inFigure 9.Faster slew rates willcause thedevice toclamp theinput\nsignal and draw current through thedevice forafewmicroseconds, increasing therisetime ofthesignal. This\nwillnotcause anyharm tothesystem ortothedevice, however ifthefastinput voltage swings occur regularly it\ncancause device overheating.\n11TVS1400\nwww.ti.com SLVSED3A –DECEMBER 2017 –REVISED MARCH 2018\nProduct Folder Links: TVS1400Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2017 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated9Application andImplementation\nNOTE\nInformation inthe following applications sections isnot part ofthe TIcomponent\nspecification, and TIdoes notwarrant itsaccuracy orcompleteness. TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nThe TVS1400 canbeused toprotect anypower, analog, ordigital signal from transient fault conditions caused\nbytheenvironment orother electrical components.\n9.2 Typical Application\nFigure 10.TVS1400 Application Schematic\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\nAtypical operation fortheTVS1400 would beprotecting inafactory control application, protecting ananalog\ninput toanADC input similar toFigure 10.Inthisexample, twoTVS1400 ’sareinabidirectional configuration\nprotecting theinput toanADS8689, anADC with aninput voltage range of±12.288 Vandanabsolute maximum\ninput voltage range of±20V.Without any input protection, ifasurge event iscaused bylightning, coupling,\nringing, orany other fault condition thisinput voltage willrise tohundreds ofvolts formultiple microseconds,\nviolating theabsolute maximum input voltage and harming thedevice. Anideal surge protection diode will\nmaximize theuseable voltage range while stillclamping atasafe level forthesystem, soTI\'s Flat-Clamp\ntechnology provides thebest protection solution.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\nIftheTVS1400 isinplace toprotect thedevice, during asurge event thevoltage willrisetothebreakdown ofthe\ndiode at16.8 V,andthen theTVS1400 willturn on,shunting thesurge current toground. With thelowdynamic\nresistance oftheTVS1400, even large amounts ofsurge current willhave minimal impact ontheclamping\nvoltage. The dynamic resistance oftheTVS1400 isaround 30mΩ,which means 43Aofsurge current willcause\navoltage raise of43A×30mΩ=1.29 V.Because thedevice turns onat16.8 V,thismeans theADC input will\nbeexposed toamaximum of16.8 V+1.29 V=18.09 Vduring surge pulses, well within theADS8689 absolute\nmaximum. This pulse isshown inFigure 11andensures robust protection ofyour circuit.\nTime (Ps)Voltage (V)/Surge Current (A)\n10203040506070 80-5051015202530354045\nD001TVS1400 Voltage\nSurge Current\n12TVS1400\nSLVSED3A –DECEMBER 2017 –REVISED MARCH 2018 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TVS1400Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2017 –2018, Texas Instruments IncorporatedTypical Application (continued)\nInaddition, thelowleakage and capacitance oftheTVS1400 guarantees lowinput distortion. At14V,giving\nmargin onthe±12.288 Vrange oftheADS8689, thedevice willsee typical 10nAleakage, which willhave\nminimal effect ontheoverall system. The TVS1400 lowcapacitance of125 pFwillalso cause less effect on\nsignal integrity compared toindustry standard devices liketheSMBJ14A which has1500 pFofcapacitance and\ncancause upto3dBofTHD attenuation inmeasured systems.\nFinally, thesmall size ofthedevice also improves fault protection bylowering theeffect offault current coupling\nonto neighboring traces. The small form factor oftheTVS1400 allows thedevice tobeplaced extremely close to\ntheinput connector, lowering thelength ofthepath fault current willtake through thesystem compared tolarger\nprotection solutions.\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nFigure 11.TVS1400 Clamping Response at43A\n9.2.4 Configuration Options\nThe TVS1400 can beused ineither unidirectional orbidirectional configuration. shows bidirectional usage to\nprotect aninput. Byplacing two TVS1400\'s inseries with reverse orientation, bidirectional operation can be\nutilized which willallow aworking voltage of±14V.TVS1400 operation inbidirectional willbesimilar to\nunidirectional operation, with aminor increase inbreakdown voltage and clamping voltage. The TVS3300\nbidirectional performance has been characterized intheTVS3300 Configurations Characterization .While the\nTVS1400 inbidirectional configuration has notspecifically been characterized, itwillhave similar relative\nchanges totheTVS3300 inbidirectional configuration.\n10Power Supply Recommendations\nThe TVS1400 isaclamping device sothere isnoneed topower it.Becareful nottoviolate therecommended\nVINvoltage range (0Vto14V)toensure thedevice functions properly.\nGND Plane\nGND\nGNDGNDGND\nI/OI/OI/OConnector\nInputProtected\nInput\n13TVS1400\nwww.ti.com SLVSED3A –DECEMBER 2017 –REVISED MARCH 2018\nProduct Folder Links: TVS1400Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2017 –2018, Texas Instruments Incorporated11Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nThe optimum placement isasclose totheconnector aspossible. EMI during anESD event cancouple from the\ntrace being struck toother nearby unprotected traces, resulting inearly system failures. The PCB designer needs\ntominimize thepossibility ofEMI coupling bykeeping any unprotected traces away from theprotected traces\nwhich arebetween theTVS andtheconnector.\nRoute theprotected traces asstraight aspossible.\nEliminate anysharp corners ontheprotected traces between theTVS1400 andtheconnector byusing rounded\ncorners with thelargest radii possible.
