C\nThis revision of the ADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/\nADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L processor data sheet combines the \nADSP-2184L, ADSP-2185L, ADSP-2186L, and ADSP-2187L. \nThis version also contains new RoHS compliant packages.\nADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nRev. C | Page 3  of 48 | January 2008GENERAL DESCRIPTION\nThe ADSP-218xL series consists of four single chip microcom-\nputers optimized for digital signal processing applications. The \nfunctional block diagram for the ADSP-218xL series members \nappears in Figure 1 on Page 1. All series members are pin-com-\npatible and are differentiated solely by the amount of on-chip SRAM. This feature, combined with ADSP-21xx code compati-\nbility, provides a great deal of flexibility in the design decision. \nSpecific family members are shown in Table 1 .\nADSP-218xL series members co mbine the ADSP -2100 family \nbase architecture (three comput ational units, data address gen-\nerators, and a program sequencer) with two serial ports, a 16-bit \ninternal DMA port, a byte DMA port, a programmable timer, \nflag I/O, extensive interrupt capabilities, and on-chip program \nand data memory.\nADSP-218xL series members inte grate up to 160K bytes of on-\nchip memory configured as up  to 32K words (24-bit) of pro-\ngram RAM, and up to 32K words (16-bit) of data RAM. Power-\ndown circuitry is also provided to meet the low power needs of \nbattery-operated portable equipm ent. The ADSP-218xL is avail-\nable in 100-lead LQFP and 144-ball BGA packages.\nFabricated using high-speed, low-power, CMOS processes, \nADSP-218xL series members oper ate with a 19 ns instruction \ncycle time (ADSP-2185L and ADSP-2187L) or a a 25 ns instruc-tion cycle time (ADSP-2184L  and ADSP-2186L). Every \ninstruction can execute in a single processor cycle.\nThe ADSP-218xL’s flexible arch itecture and comprehensive \ninstruction set allow the proce ssor to perform multiple opera-\ntions in parallel. In one proc essor cycle, ADSP-218xL series \nmembers can:\n• Generate the next program address\n• Fetch the next instruction\n• Perform one or two data moves\n• Update one or two data address pointers\n• Perform a computational operation\nThis takes place while the processor continues to:\n• Receive and transmit data through the two serial ports\n• Receive and/or transmit data through the internal \nDMA port\n• Receive and/or transmit data through the byte DMA port\n• Decrement timerARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW\nThe ADSP-218xL series instructio n set provides flexible data \nmoves and multifunction (one or two data moves with a com-\nputation) instructions. Every instruction can be executed in a \nsingle processor cycle. The ADSP -218xL assembly language uses \nan algebraic syntax for ease of coding and readability. A com-\nprehensive set of development tools supports program \ndevelopment.\nThe functional block diagram is an overall block diagram of the \nADSP-218xL series. Th e processor contains  three independent \ncomputational units: the ALU,  the multiplier/accumulator \n(MAC), and the shifter. The comp utational units process 16-bit \ndata directly and have provisions to support multiprecision computations. The ALU performs a standard set of arithmetic \nand logic operations; division pr imitives are also supported. The \nMAC performs single-cycle mult iply, multiply/add, and multi-\nply/subtract operations with 40 bits of accumulation. The shifter performs logical and arithmetic shifts, normalization, denor-\nmalization, and derive exponent operations.\nThe shifter can be used to efficiently implement numeric format \ncontrol, including multiword and block floating-point \nrepresentations.\nThe internal result (R) bus connects the computational units so \nthat the output of any unit may be the input of any unit on the \nnext cycle.\nA powerful program sequencer and two dedicated data address \ngenerators ensure efficient delivery of operands to these compu-tational units. The sequence r supports conditional jumps, \nsubroutine calls, and returns in a single cycle. With internal loop counters and loop stac ks, ADSP-218xL series members \nexecute looped code with zero overhead; no explicit jump \ninstructions are required to maintain loops.\nTwo data address generators (DAGs) provide addresses for \nsimultaneous dual operand fetches (from data memory and pro-\ngram memory). Each DAG mainta ins and updates four address \npointers. Whenever the pointer is  used to access data (indirect \naddressing), it is post-modified by  the value of one of four possi-\nble modify registers. A length va lue may be associated with each \npointer to implement automatic modulo addressing for \ncircular buffers.\nFive internal buses provide efficient data transfer:\n• Program Memory Address (PMA) Bus\n• Program Memory Data (PMD) Bus\n• Data Memory Address (DMA) Bus\n• Data Memory Data (DMD) Bus\n• Result (R) BusTable 1. ADSP-218xL DSP Microcomputer Family \nDeviceProgram Memory \n(K words)Data Memory (K words)\nADSP-2184L 4 4\nADSP-2185L 16 16\nADSP-2186L 8 8\nADSP-2187L 32 32\nRev. C | Page 4  of 48 | January 2008ADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nThe two address buses (PMA and DMA) share a single external \naddress bus, allowing memory to be expanded off-chip, and the \ntwo data buses (PMD and DMD) share a single external data \nbus. Byte memory space and I/ O memory space also share the \nexternal buses.\nProgram memory can store both instructions and data, permit-\nting ADSP-218xL series members to fetch two operands in a \nsingle cycle, one from program memory and one from data \nmemory. ADSP-218xL series me mbers can fetch an operand \nfrom program memory and the next instruction in the \nsame cycle.\nIn lieu of the address and data bus for external memory connec-\ntion, ADSP-218xL series members can be configured for 16-bit \nInternal DMA port (IDMA port) connection to external sys-\ntems. The IDMA port is made up of 16 data/address pins and \nfive control pins. The IDMA port provides transparent, direct \naccess to the DSP’s on-chi p program and data RAM.\nAn interface to low cost, byte-wide memory is provided by the \nByte DMA port (BDMA port). Th e BDMA port is bidirectional \nand can directly address up to four megabytes of external RAM \nor ROM for off-chip storage of program overlays or data tables.\nThe byte memory and I/O memory space interface supports \nslow memories and I/O memory-mapped peripherals with pro-\ngrammable wait state generation . External devices can gain \ncontrol of external buses with bus request/grant signals (BR , \nBGH , and BG ). One execution mode (Go Mode) allows the \nADSP-218xL to continue runnin g from on-chip memory. Nor-\nmal execution mode requires the processor to halt while buses \nare granted.\nADSP-218xL series members can re spond to eleven interrupts. \nThere can be up to six external  interrupts (one edge-sensitive, \ntwo level-sensitive, and three configurable) and seven internal \ninterrupts generated by the timer, the serial ports (SPORT), the \nBDMA port, and the power-down circuitry. There is also a mas-ter RESET\n signal. The two serial ports provide a complete \nsynchronous serial interface with optional companding in hard-ware and a wide variety of fram ed or frameless data transmit \nand receive modes of operation. Each serial port can generate an \ninternal programmable serial clock or accept an external \nserial clock.\nADSP-218xL series members provid e up to 13 general-purpose \nflag pins. The data input and output pins on SPORT1 can be \nalternatively configured as an in put flag and an output flag. In \naddition, eight flags are programmable as inputs or outputs, and \nthree flags are always outputs.\nA programmable interval timer ge nerates periodic interrupts. A \n16-bit count register (TCOUNT) decrements every n processor \ncycle, where n is a scaling value stored in an 8-bit register (TSCALE). When the value of th e count register reaches zero, \nan interrupt is generated and the count register is reloaded from \na 16-bit period register (TPERIOD).Serial Ports\nADSP-218xL series me mbers incorporate two complete syn-\nchronous serial ports (SPO RT0 and SPORT1) for serial \ncommunications and mult iprocessor communication.\nFollowing is a brief list of th e capabilities of the ADSP-218xL \nSPORTs. For additional information on Serial Ports, refer to the \nADSP-218x DSP Hardware Reference .\n• SPORTs are bidirectional and have a separate, double-\nbuffered transmit and receive section.\n• SPORTs can use an external serial clock or generate their \nown serial clock internally.\n• SPORTs have independent framing for the receive and \ntransmit sections. Sections run in a frameless mode or with \nframe synchronization signals in ternally or externally gen-\nerated. Frame sync signals are active high or inverted, with \neither of two pulse widths and timings.\n• SPORTs support serial data word lengths from 3 bits to \n16 bits and provide optional A-law and μ-law companding, \naccording to CCITT recommendation G.711.\n• SPORT receive and transmit sections can generate unique \ninterrupts on completing a data word transfer.\n• SPORTs can receive and transmit  an entire circular buffer \nof data with only one overhead cycle per data word. An \ninterrupt is generated afte r a data buffer transfer.\n• SPORT0 has a multichannel interface to selectively receive \nand transmit a 24-word or 32-word, time-division multi-\nplexed, serial bitstream.\n• SPORT1 can be configured to have two external interrupts \n(IRQ0  and IRQ1 ) and the FI and FO signals. The internally \ngenerated serial clock may still be used in this \nconfiguration.\nMODES OF OPERATION\nThe ADSP-218xL series modes of operation appear in Table 2 . \nOnly the ADSP-2187L prov ides Mode D operation\nSetting Memory Mode\nMemory Mode selection for th e ADSP-218xL series is made \nduring chip reset through the use of the Mode C pin. This pin is \nmultiplexed with the DSP’s PF2 pin, so care must be taken in how the mode selection is made. The two methods for selecting \nthe value of Mode C are active and passive.\nPassive Configuration\nPassive Configuration involves the use of a pull-up or pull-\ndown resistor connected to the Mode C pin. To minimize power \nconsumption, or if the PF2 pin is to be used as an output in the DSP application, a weak pull-up or  pull-down resistance, on the \norder of 10 k Ω, can be used. This value should be sufficient to \npull the pin to the desired level an d still allow the pin to operate \nas a programmable flag output without undue strain on the pro-\ncessor’s output driver. For minimum power consumption \nADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nRev. C | Page 5  of 48 | January 2008during power-down, reconfigure PF 2 to be an input, as the pull-\nup or pull-down resistance will hold the pin in a known state, \nand will not switch.\nActive Configuration\nActive Configuration involves th e use of a three-statable exter-\nnal driver connected to the Mode C pin. A driver’s output \nenable should be connec ted to the DSP’s RESET  signal such that \nit only drives the PF2 pin when RESET  is active (low). When \nRESET  is deasserted, the driver sh ould be three-state, thus \nallowing full use of the PF2 pin as either an input or output. To \nminimize power consumption during power-down, configure \nthe programmable flag as an output when connected to a three-stated buffer. This ensures that th e pin will be held at a constant \nlevel, and will not oscillate should  the three-state driver’s level \nhover around the logic switching point.\nIDMA ACK Configuration (ADSP-2187L Only)\nMode D = 0 and in Host Mode: IACK  is an active, driven signal \nand cannot be “wire-OR’ed.” Mode D = 1 and in Host Mode: IACK\n is an open drain and requir es an external pull-down, but \nmultiple IACK  pins can be “wire-OR’ed” together.\nINTERRUPTS\nThe interrupt controller allows the processor to respond to the eleven possible interrupts and reset with minimum overhead. \nADSP-218xL series members prov ide four dedica ted external \ninterrupt input pins: IRQ2\n, IRQL0 , IRQL1 , and IRQE  (shared \nwith the PF7–4 pins). In addi tion, SPORT1 may be reconfig-\nured for IRQ0 , IRQ1 , FI, and FO, for a total of six external \ninterrupts. The ADSP-218xL also supports internal interrupts from the timer, the byte DMA port, the two serial ports, soft-\nware, and the power-down control circuit. The interrupt levels \nare internally prioritized and individually maskable (except \npower-down and reset). The IRQ2 , IRQ0 , and IRQ1  input pins \ncan be programmed to be either level- or edge-sensitive. IRQL0  \nand IRQL1  are level-sensitive and IRQE  is edge-sensitive. The \npriorities and vector addresses of all interrupts are shown in \nTable 3 .\nInterrupt routines can either be  nested with higher priority \ninterrupts taking precedence or processed sequentially. Inter-\nrupts can be masked or unmask ed with the IMASK register. Table 2.

C | Page 6  of 48 | January 2008ADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nIndividual interrupt requests are logically AND’ed with the bits \nin IMASK; the highest priority unmasked interrupt is then \nselected. The power-down interrupt is nonmaskable.\nADSP-218xL series members mask all interrupts for one \ninstruction cycle following the execution of an instruction that \nmodifies the IMASK register. This  does not affect serial port \nautobuffering or DMA transfers.\nThe interrupt control register, ICNTL, controls interrupt nest-\ning and defines the IRQ0 , IRQ1 , and IRQ2  external interrupts to \nbe either edge- or level-sensitive. The IRQE  pin is an external \nedge-sensitive interrupt and ca n be forced and cleared. The \nIRQL0  and IRQL1  pins are external level sensitive interrupts.\nThe IFC register is a write-only register used to force and clear \ninterrupts. On-chip stacks preser ve the processor status and are \nautomatically maintained during interrupt handling. The stacks are 12 levels deep to allow interr upt, loop, and subroutine nest-\ning. The following instructions allow global enable or disable \nservicing of the interrupts (inc luding power-down), regardless \nof the state of IMASK:\nENA INTS;\nDIS INTS;\nDisabling the interrupts does not affect serial port autobuffering or DMA. When the processor is reset, interrupt servicing \nis enabled.\nLOW POWER OPERATION\nADSP-218xL series members have  three low-power modes that \nsignificantly reduce the power di ssipation when the device oper-\nates under standby conditions. These modes are:\n• Power-Down\n•I d l e\n• Slow Idle\nThe CLKOUT pin may also be di sabled to reduce external \npower dissipation.\nPower-Down\nADSP-218xL series members have a low-power feature that lets the processor enter a very low-power dormant state through hardware or software control. Fo llowing is a brief list of power-\ndown features. Refer to the ADSP-218x DSP Hardware Refer-\nence, “System Interface” chapter, for detailed information about \nthe power-down feature.\n• Quick recovery from power- down. The processor begins \nexecuting instructions in as few as 400 CLKIN cycles.\n• Support for an externally ge nerated TTL or CMOS proces-\nsor clock. The external clock can continue running during power-down without affecting the lowest power rating and \n400 CLKIN cycle recovery.• Support for crystal operation includes disabling the oscilla-\ntor to save power (the pr ocessor automatically waits \napproximately 4096 CLKIN cycles  for the crystal oscillator \nto start or stabilize), and letting the oscillator run to allow \n400 CLKIN cycle start-up.\n• Power-down is initiated by either the power-down pin \n(PWD ) or the software power-do wn force bit. Interrupt \nsupport allows an unlimited nu mber of instructions to be \nexecuted before optionally  powering down. The power-\ndown interrupt also can be used as a nonmaskable, edge-\nsensitive interrupt.\n• Context clear/save control allo ws the processor to continue \nwhere it left off or start with  a clean context when leaving \nthe power-down state.\n•T h e  R E S E T  pin also can be used to terminate power-down. \n• Power-down acknowledge pin (PWDACK) indicates when \nthe processor has entered power-down.\nIdle\nWhen the ADSP-218xL is in the Idle Mode, the processor waits indefinitely in a low-power st ate until an interrupt occurs. \nWhen an unmasked interrupt occu rs, it is serviced; execution \nthen continues with the instruct ion following the IDLE instruc-\ntion. In Idle Mode IDMA, BDMA , and autobuffer cycle steals \nstill occur.\nSlow Idle\nThe IDLE instruction is enhanc ed on ADSP-218xL series mem-\nbers to let the processor’s internal  clock signal be slowed, further \nreducing power consumption. The reduced clock frequency, a \nprogrammable fraction of the norm al clock rate, is specified by a \nselectable divisor given in the IDLE instruction.\nThe format of the instruction is:\nIDLE (n);\nwhere n = 16, 32, 64, or 128. This instruction keeps the proces-\nsor fully functional, but operating at the slower clock rate. While \nit is in this state, the processor’s other internal clock signals, \nsuch as SCLK, CLKOUT, and timer clock, are reduced by the same ratio. The default form of the instruction, when no clock \ndivisor is given, is the standard IDLE  instruction.\nWhen the IDLE (n) instruction is used, it effectively slows down \nthe processor’s internal clock an d thus its response time to \nincoming interrupts. The one-cycl e response time of the stan-\ndard idle state is increased by n, the clock divisor. When an \nenabled interrupt is received, ADSP-218xL se ries members \nremain in the idle state for up to a maximum of n processor \ncycles (n = 16, 32, 64, or 128) before resuming \nnormal operation.\nWhen the IDLE (n) instruction is used in systems that have an \nexternally generated serial clock (SCLK), the serial clock rate \nmay be faster than the processo r’s reduced internal clock rate. \nUnder these conditions, interrupts must not be generated at a \nADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nRev. C | Page 7  of 48 | January 2008faster rate than can be serviced, due to the additional time the \nprocessor takes to come out of the idle state (a maximum of n \nprocessor cycles).\nSYSTEM INTERFACE\nFigure 2  shows typical basic system  configurations with the \nADSP-218xL series, two serial devices, a byte-wide EPROM, \nand optional external program and data overlay memories (mode-selectable). Programmable wait state generation allows \nthe processor to connect easily to slow peripheral devices. ADSP-218xL series members also provide four external inter-rupts and two serial ports or si x external interrupts and one \nserial port. Host Memory Mode a llows access to the full external \ndata bus, but limits addressing to a single address bit (A0). Through the use of external hardware, additional system \nperipherals can be added in this mode to generate and latch \naddress signals.\nClock Signals\nADSP-218xL series members can be  clocked by either a crystal \nor a TTL-compatible clock signal.\nThe CLKIN input cannot be halted, changed during operation, \nnor operated below the specified frequency during normal oper-\nation. The only exception is while the processor is in the power-down state. For addition al information, refer to the \nADSP-218x DSP Hardware Reference , for detailed information \non this power-down feature.\nIf an external clock is used, it should be a TTL-compatible signal \nrunning at half the instruction rate. The signal is connected to \nthe processor’s CLKIN input. When  an external clock is used, \nthe XTAL pin must be left unconnected.\nADSP-218xL series members use an input clock with a fre-\nquency equal to half the instruction rate; a 40 MHz input clock \nyields a 12.5  ns processor cycle (which is equivalent to \n80 MHz). Normally, instructions are executed in a single pro-cessor cycle. All device timing is relative to the internal \ninstruction clock rate, which is indicated by the CLKOUT signal \nwhen enabled.\nBecause ADSP-218xL series memb ers include an on-chip oscil-\nlator circuit, an external crysta l may be used. The crystal should \nbe connected across the CLKIN and XTAL pins, with two \ncapacitors connected as shown in Figure 3 . Capacitor values are \ndependent on crystal type and shou ld be specified by the crystal \nmanufacturer. A parallel-resonant, fundamental frequency, microprocessor-grade crystal shou ld be used. To provide an \nadequate feedback path  around the internal amplifier circuit, \nplace a resistor in parallel with the circuit, as shown in Figure 3 .\nA clock output (CLKOUT) signal is generated by the processor \nat the processor’s cycle rate. This  can be enabled and disabled by \nthe CLKODIS bit in the SPORT0 Autobuffer Control Register.\nFigure 2.

RESET  during initial \npower-up must be held long enou gh to allow the internal clock \nto stabilize. If RESET  is activated any time after power-up, the \nclock continues to run and does not require stabilization time.\nThe power-up sequence is defined as the total time required for \nthe crystal oscillator circuit to stabilize after a valid V DD is \napplied to the processor, and for the internal phase-locked loop \n(PLL) to lock onto the specific crystal frequency. A minimum of \n2000 CLKIN cycles ensures that the PLL has locked, but does not include the crystal oscillator start-up time. During this \npower-up sequence, the RESET\n signal should be held low. On \nany subsequent resets, the RESET  signal must meet the mini-\nmum pulse width specification (t RSP).\nThe RESET  input contains some hysteresis; however, if an RC \ncircuit is used to generate the RESET  signal, the use of an exter-\nnal Schmitt trigger is recommended.\nThe master reset sets all intern al stack pointers to the empty \nstack condition, masks all interrupts, and clears the MSTAT \nregister. When RESET  is released, if there is no pending bus \nrequest and the chip is configured  for booting, the boot-loading sequence is performed. The first instruction is fetched from on-\nchip program memory locati on 0x0000 once boot loading \ncompletes.\nMEMORY ARCHITECTURE\nThe ADSP-218xL series provides  a variety of memory and \nperipheral interface options. The key functional groups are Pro-\ngram Memory, Data Memory, Byte Memory, and I/O. Refer to Figure 4  through Figure 7  for PM and DM memory allocations \nin the ADSP-218xL series. \nProgram Memory\nProgram Memory (Full Memory Mode) is a 24-bit-wide space \nfor storing both in struction opcodes and data. The member \nDSPs of this series have up to 32K words of Program Memory \nRAM on chip, and the capability of accessing up to two 8K \nexternal memory overlay spaces, using the external data bus.\nProgram Memory (Host Mode) allo ws access to all internal \nmemory. External overlay access is  limited by a single external \naddress line (A0). External progra m execution is not available in \nHost Mode due to a restricted data  bus that is only 16 bits wide.\nData Memory\nData Memory (Full Memory Mode ) is a 16-bit-wide space used \nfor the storage of data variables and for memory-mapped con-\ntrol registers. The ADSP-218xL series has up to 32K words of \nData Memory RAM on-chip. Part of this space is used by 32 \nmemory-mapped registers. Support also exists for up to two 8K \nexternal memory overlay spaces through the external data bus.\nAll internal accesses complete in one cycle. Accesses to external \nmemory are timed using the wait states specified by the DWAIT \nregister.\nData Memory (Host Mode) allows access to all internal mem-\nory. External overlay access is limited by a single external \naddress line (A0).Figure 3. External Crystal ConnectionsCLKIN CLKOUT XTAL\nDSP1M/H9024\nFigure 4.

C | Page 10  of 48 | January 2008ADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nI/O Space (Full Memory Mode)\nADSP-218xL series members support an additional external \nmemory space called I/O space. This space is designed to sup-\nport simple connections to periph erals (such as data converters \nand external registers) or to bu s interface ASIC data registers. \nI/O space supports 2048 locations of 16-bit wide data. The lower \neleven bits of the external address bus are used; the upper three \nbits are undefined.\nTwo instructions were added to the core ADSP-2100 family \ninstruction set to read from and write to I/O memory space. The \nI/O space also has four dedicated 3-bit wait state registers, \nIOWAIT0–3 as shown in Figure 8 , which specify up to seven \nwait states to be automatically  generated for each of four \nregions. The wait states act on address ranges, as shown in \nTable 6 .\nNote: In Full Memory Mode, all 2048 locations of I/O space are \ndirectly addressable.  In Host Memory Mode, only address pin \nA0 is available; therefore, additi onal logic is required externally \nto achieve complete addressa bility of the 2048 I/O space \nlocations.Composite Memory Select\nADSP-218xL series me mbers have a prog rammable memory \nselect signal that is useful for generating memory select signals \nfor memories mapped to more  than one space. The CMS  signal \nis generated to have the same timing as each of the individual \nmemory select signals (PMS , DMS , BMS , IOMS ) but can com-\nbine their functionality. Each bit in the CMSSEL register, when set, causes the CMS\n signal to be asserted when the selected \nmemory select is asserted. For example, to use a 32K word \nmemory to act as both program and data memory, set the PMS  \nand DMS  bits in the CMSSEL register and use the CMS  pin to \ndrive the chip select of th e memory, and use either DMS  or PMS  \nas the additional address bit.\nThe CMS  pin functions like the other memory select signals \nwith the same timing and bus request logic. A 1 in the enable bit \ncauses the assertion of the CMS  signal at the same time as the \nselected memory select signal. All enable bits default to 1 at \nreset, except the BMS  bit.Table 4.

C | Page 11  of 48 | January 2008See Figure 9  and Figure 10  for illustration of the programmable \nflag and composite control register and the system \ncontrol register.\nByte Memory Select\nThe ADSP-218xL’s BMS  disable feature combined with the \nCMS  pin allows use of multiple memories in the byte memory \nspace. For example, an EPROM could be attached to the BMS  \nselect, and a flash memory could be connected to CMS . Because \nat reset BMS  is enabled, the EPROM would be used for booting. \nAfter booting, software could disable BMS  and set the CMS  sig-\nnal to respond to BMS , enabling the flash memory.\nByte Memory\nThe byte memory space is a bidirectional, 8-bit-wide, \nexternal memory space used to store programs and data. Byte \nmemory is accessed using the BD MA feature. The byte memory \nspace consists of 256 pages, each of which is 16K /H115478b i t s .\nThe byte memory space on th e ADSP-218xL series supports \nread and write operations as well as four different data formats. \nThe byte memory uses data bits 15–8 for data. The byte mem-\nory uses data bits 23–16 and addr ess bits 13–0 to create a 22-bit \naddress. This allows up to a 4 megabit /H115478 (32 megabit) ROM \nor RAM to be used without glue logic. All byte memory accesses \nare timed by the BMWAIT register.Byte Memory DMA (BDMA, Full Memory Mode)\nThe byte memory DMA controller ( Figure 11 ) allows loading \nand storing of program instruct ions and data using the byte \nmemory space. The BDMA circuit is able to access the byte memory space while the processo r is operating normally and \nsteals only one DSP cycle per 8- , 16-, or 24-bit word transferred.\nThe BDMA circuit supports four different data formats that are \nselected by the BTYPE register field. The appropriate number of \n8-bit accesses are done from the byte memory space to build the \nword size selected. Table 7  shows the data formats supported by \nthe BDMA circuit.\nUnused bits in the 8-bit data me mory formats are filled with 0s. \nThe BIAD register field is used to  specify the starting address for \nthe on-chip memory involved with the transfer. The 14-bit \nBEAD register specifies the starti ng address for the external byte \nmemory space. The 8-bit BMPAGE  register specifies the start-\ning page for the external byte me mory space. The BDIR register \nfield selects the direction of the transfer. Finally, the 14-bit \nBWCOUNT register specifies th e number of DSP words to \ntransfer and initiates th e BDMA circuit transfers.\nBDMA accesses can cross page bo undaries during sequential \naddressing. A BDMA interrupt is generated on the completion \nof the number of tr ansfers specified by the BWCOUNT register.\nThe BWCOUNT register is updated after each transfer so it can \nbe used to check the status of the transfers. When it reaches \nzero, the transfers have finished and a BDMA interrupt is gener-ated. The BMPAGE and BEAD registers must not be accessed \nby the DSP during BDMA operations. The source or destination \nof a BDMA transfer is always on-chip program or data memory.\nWhen the BWCOUNT register is written with a nonzero value \nthe BDMA circuit starts executing byte memory accesses with \nwait states set by BMWAIT. Th ese accesses continue until the \ncount reaches zero. When enough accesses have occurred to Figure 9. Programmable Flag and Composite Control Register\nFigure 10.

DSP accesses to \nexternal memory have pr iority over BDMA byte \nmemory accesses.\nThe BDMA Context Reset bit (BCR) controls whether the pro-\ncessor is held off while the BDMA accesses are occurring. \nSetting the BCR bit to 0 allows the processor to continue opera-tions. Setting the BCR bit to 1 causes the processor to stop \nexecution while the BDMA accesse s are occurring, to clear the \ncontext of the processor, and st art execution at address 0 when \nthe BDMA accesses have completed.\nThe BDMA overlay bits specify the OVLAY memory blocks to \nbe accessed for internal memory. Set these bits as indicated in \nFigure 11 . \nNote: BDMA cannot access extern al overlay memory regions 1 \nand 2.The BMWAIT field, which has 3 bits on ADSP-218xL series \nmembers, allows selection of up  to 7 wait states for BDMA \ntransfers.\nInternal Memory DMA Port (IDMA Port; Host Memory \nMode)\nThe IDMA Port provides an ef ficient means of  communication \nbetween a host system  and ADSP-218xL series members. The \nport is used to access the on-chip program memory and data \nmemory of the DSP with only one DSP cycle per word over-\nhead. The IDMA port cannot, howe ver, be used to write to the \nDSP’s memory-mapped control registers. A typical IDMA \ntransfer process is  shown as follows:\n1. Host starts IDMA transfer.\n2. Host checks IACK  control line to see if the DSP is busy.\n3. Host uses IS  and IAL control lines to  latch either the DMA \nstarting address (IDMAA) or the PM/DM OVLAY selec-\ntion into the DSP’s IDMA control registers. If Bit 15 = 1, \nthe values of Bits 7–0 represent the IDMA overlay; Bits 14–8 must be set to 0. If Bit 15 = 0, the value of Bits 13–0 \nrepresent the starting address of internal memory to be \naccessed and Bit 14 reflects PM or DM for access. Set \nIDDMOVLAY and IDPMOVLAY bits in the IDMA over-\nlay register as indicted in Table 8 .\n4. Host uses IS  and IRD  (or IWR ) to read (or write) DSP \ninternal memory (PM or DM).\n5. Host checks IACK  line to see if the DSP has completed the \nprevious IDMA operation.\n6. Host ends IDMA transfer.The IDMA port has a 16-bit multiplexed address and data bus \nand supports 24-bit program memory. The IDMA port is com-\npletely asynchronous and can be  written while the ADSP-218xL \nis operating at full speed.\nThe DSP memory address is latched and then automatically \nincremented after each IDMA transaction. An external device \ncan therefore access a block of sequentially ad dressed memory \nby specifying only the starting  address of the block. This \nincreases throughput as the addre ss does not have to be sent for \neach memory access.\nIDMA port access occurs in two phases. The first is the IDMA \nAddress Latch cycle. When the ac knowledge is asserted, a 14-bit \naddress and 1-bit destination type can be driven onto the bus by \nan external device. The addre ss specifies an on-chip memory \nlocation, the destination type spec ifies whether it is a DM or PM \naccess. The falling edge of the IDMA address latch signal (IAL) \nor the missing edge of th e IDMA select signal (IS ) latches this \nvalue into the IDMAA register.Once the address is stored, data can be read from, or written to, \nthe ADSP-218xL’s on-c hip memory. Asserting the select line \n(IS\n) and the appropriate read or write line (IRD  and IWR  \nrespectively) signals the ADSP-218xL that a particular transac-\ntion is required. In either case , there is a one-processor-cycle \ndelay for synchronization. The memory access consumes one \nadditional processor cycle.\nOnce an access has occurred, th e latched address is automati-\ncally incremented, and another access can occur.\nThrough the IDMAA register, the DSP can also specify the \nstarting address and data format for DMA operation. \nAsserting the IDMA port select (IS ) and address latch enable \n(IAL) directs the ADSP-218xL to write the address onto the \nIAD14–0 bus into the ID MA Control Register ( Figure 12 ). If Bit \n15 is set to 0, IDMA latches the address. If Bit 15 is set to 1, IDMA latches into the OVLAY re gister. This register, also \nshown in Figure 12 , is memory-mapped at address DM \n(0x3FE0). Note that the latche d address (IDMAA) cannot be \nread back by the host. The IDMA  Overlay register applies to \nThe ADSP-2187L processor only.\nWhen Bit 14 in 0x3FE7 is set to zero, short reads use the timing \nshown in Figure 26 on Page 34 . When Bit 14 in 0x3FE7 is set to \n1, timing in Figure 27 on Page 35  applies for short reads in Short \nRead Only Mode. Set IDDMOVLAY and IDPMOVLAY bits in \nthe IDMA overlay regist er as indicated in Table 8 . Refer to the  \nADSP-218x DSP Hardware Reference  for additional details.Table 8.

C | Page 13  of 48 | January 2008Note: In Full Memory Mode, all locations of 4M-byte memory \nspace are directly addressable. In Host Memory Mode, only \naddress pin A0 is available, requiring additional external logic to \nprovide address information for the byte. \nBootstrap Loading (Booting)\nADSP-218xL series members have  two mechanisms to allow \nautomatic loading of the internal program memory after reset. The method for booting is contro lled by the Mode A, Mode B, \nand Mode C configuration bits.\nWhen the mode pins specify BDMA booting, the ADSP-218xL \ninitiates a BDMA boot sequence when reset is released.The BDMA interface is set up during reset to the following \ndefaults when BDMA booting is specified: the BDIR, BMPAGE, BIAD, and BEAD registers are set to  0, the BTYPE register is set \nto 0 to specify program memory 24-bit words, and the BWCOUNT register is set to 32.  This causes 32 words of on-\nchip program memory to be loaded from byte memory. These \n32 words are used to set up the BDMA to load in the remaining \nprogram code. The BCR bit is also set to 1, which causes pro-\ngram execution to be held off un til all 32 words are loaded into \non-chip program memory. Executio n then begins at address 0.\nThe ADSP-2100 Family developm ent software (Revision 5.02 \nand later) fully supports the BDMA booting feature and can \ngenerate byte memory space-compatible boot code.\nThe IDLE instruction can also be used to allow the processor to \nhold off execution while bootin g continues through the BDMA \ninterface. For BDMA accesse s while in Host Mode, the \naddresses to boot memory must be constructed externally to the \nADSP-218xL. The only  memory address bi t provided by the \nprocessor is A0.\nIDMA Port Booting\nADSP-218xL series members can also boot programs through \nits internal DMA port. If Mode C = 1, Mode B = 0, and Mode A = 1, the ADSP-218xL boots from the IDMA port. IDMA feature can load as much on-chip memory as desired. Program execu-tion is held off until the host writes to on-chip program memory \nlocation 0.\nBUS REQUEST AND BUS GRANT\nADSP-218xL series members can relinquish control of the data and address buses to an extern al device. When the external \ndevice requires access to memory, it asserts the Bus Request \n(BR\n) signal. If the ADSP-218xL is not performing an external \nmemory access, it responds to the active BR  input in the follow-\ning processor cycle by: \n• Three-stating the data and address buses and the PMS , \nDMS , BMS , CMS , IOMS , RD , WR  output drivers,\n• Asserting the bus grant (BG ) signal, and\n• Halting program execution.\nIf Go Mode is enabled, the ADSP-218xL will no t halt program \nexecution until it enco unters an instruction that requires an \nexternal memory access.\nIf an ADSP-218xL series member  is performing an external \nmemory access when the external device asserts the BR  signal, it \nwill not three-state the memory interfaces nor assert the BG  sig-\nnal until the processor cycle af ter the access completes. The \ninstruction does not need to be completed when the bus is \ngranted. If a single instruction requires two external memory \naccesses, the bus will be granted between the two accesses.When the BR\n signal is released, the processor releases the BG  \nsignal, re-enables the output drivers, and continues program \nexecution from the point at which it stopped.The bus request feature operates at all times, including when the \nprocessor is booting and when RESET  is active.\nThe BGH  pin is asserted when an  ADSP-218xL series member \nrequires the external bus for a memory or BDMA access, but is \nstopped. The other device can re lease the bus by deasserting bus \nrequest. Once the bus is rele ased, the ADSP-218xL deasserts BG  \nand BGH  and executes the external memory access.\nFLAG I/O PINS\nADSP-218xL series members have  eight general-purpose pro-\ngrammable input/output flag pi ns. They are controlled by two \nmemory-mapped registers. The PFTYPE register determines the direction, 1 = output and 0 = input. The PFDATA register is used to read and write the values on the pins. Data being read \nfrom a pin configured as an input is synchronized to the \nADSP-218xL’s clock. Bits that  are programmed as outputs \nwill read the value being output.

The assembly language, which takes full advantage \nof the processor’s unique architecture, offers the follow-\ning benefits:\n• The algebraic syntax eliminates the need to remember \ncryptic assembler mnemonics. For example, a typical arith-metic add instruction, such as AR = AX0 + AY0, resembles \na simple equation.\n• Every instruction assembles in to a single, 24-bit word that \ncan execute in a single instruction cycle.\n• The syntax is a superset ADSP-2100 Family assembly lan-\nguage and is completely source and object code compatible \nwith other family members. Programs may need to be relocated to utilize on-chip memory and conform to the \nADSP-218xL’s interrupt vect or and reset vector map.\n• Sixteen condition codes are available. For conditional \njump, call, return, or arithmetic instructions, the condition can be checked and the operat ion executed in the same \ninstruction cycle.\n• Multifunction instructions a llow parallel execution of an \narithmetic instruction, with up  to two fetches or one write \nto processor memory space, during a single \ninstruction cycle.\nDEVELOPMENT SYSTEM\nAnalog Devices’ wide range of software and hardware \ndevelopment tools supports th e ADSP-218xL series. The DSP \ntools include an integrated deve lopment environment, an evalu-\nation kit, and a serial port emulator.\nVisualDSP++®† is an integrated development environment, \nallowing for fast and easy development, debugging, and deploy-\nment. The VisualDSP++ project management environment lets programmers develop and debug an application. This environ-\nment includes an easy-to-use a ssembler that is based on an \nalgebraic syntax; an archiver (lib rarian/library builder); a linker; \na PROM-splitter utility; a cycle-accurate, instruction-level simu-lator; a C compiler; and a C run-time library that includes DSP \nand mathematical functions.\nDebugging both C and asse mbly programs with the \nVisualDSP++ debugger, programmers can:\n• View mixed C and assembly code (interleaved source and \nobject information)\n• Insert break points• Set conditional breakpoints on registers, memory, and \nstacks\n• Trace instruction execution• Fill and dump memory\n• Source level debugging\nThe VisualDSP++ IDE lets programmers define and manage \nDSP software development. Th e dialog boxes and property \npages let programmers configure and manage all of the \nADSP-218xL development tools, including the syntax highlight-\ning in the VisualDSP++ editor. Th is capability co ntrols how the \ndevelopment tools process inputs and generate outputs.\nThe ADSP-2189M EZ-KIT Lite®‡ provides developers with a \ncost-effective method for initial evaluation of the powerful \nADSP-218xL DSP family ar chitecture. The ADSP-2189M\nEZ-KIT Lite includes a standalone ADSP-2189M DSP board \nsupported by an evaluation suit e of VisualDSP++. With this \nEZ-KIT Lite, users can learn about DSP hardware and software development and evaluate potential applications of the ADSP-218xL series. The ADSP-2189M  EZ-KIT Lite provides an \nevaluation suite of the Visual DSP++ development environment \nwith the C compiler, assembler, and linker. The size of the DSP \nexecutable that can be built using the EZ-KIT Lite tools is lim-\nited to 8K words.\nThe EZ-KIT Lite includes the following features:\n• 75 MHz ADSP-2189M\n• Full 16-Bit Stereo Audio I/O with AD73322 Codec\n• RS-232 Interface\n•E Z - I C E® Connector for Emulator Control\n•D S P  D e m o n s t r a t i o n  P r o g r a m s\n• Evaluation Suite of VisualDSP++\nThe ADSP-218x EZ-ICE§ Emulator provides an easier and more \ncost-effective method for engin eers to develop and optimize \nDSP systems, shortening product development cycles for faster \ntime-to-market. ADSP-218xL seri es members integrate on-chip \nemulation support with a 14-pin ICE-PortTM interface. This \ninterface provides a simpler ta rget board connection that \nrequires fewer mechanical clearance considerations than other ADSP-2100 Family EZ-ICEs. ADSP-218xL series members need \nnot be removed from the target system when using the EZ-ICE, \nnor are any adapters needed. Due to the small footprint of the EZ-ICE connector, emulation can be supported in final board \ndesigns.The EZ-ICE performs a full range of functions, \nincluding:\n• In-target operation\n• Up to 20 breakpoints\n• Single-step or full-speed operation\n• Registers and memory values  can be examined and altered\n• PC upload and download functions\n• Instruction-level emulation of program booting \nand execution\n†VisualDSP++ is a registered trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.‡EZ-KIT Lite is a registered trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.\n§EZ-ICE is a registered trademark of Analog Devices, Inc.\nADSP-2184L/ADSP-2185L/ADSP-2186L/ADSP-2187L\nRev. C | Page 15  of 48 | January 2008• Complete assembly and di sassembly of instructions\n• C source-level debugging\nDesigning an EZ-ICE-Compatible System\nADSP-218xL series members have  on-chip emulation support \nand an ICE-Port, a special set of pins that interface to the \nEZ-ICE. These features allow in-circuit emulation without \nreplacing the target system pr ocessor by using only a 14-pin \nconnection from the target system to the EZ-ICE. Target sys-\ntems must have a 14-pin connector to accept the EZ-ICE’s in-\ncircuit probe, a 14-pin plug.\nIssuing the chip reset command during emulation causes the \nDSP to perform a full chip reset, including a reset of its memory \nmode. Therefore, it is vital that  the mode pins are set correctly \nPRIOR to issuing a chip reset command from the emulator user \ninterface. If a passive method of maintaining mode information \nis being used (as discussed in Setting Memory Mode on Page 4), \nit does not matter that the mode information is latched by an \nemulator reset. However, if the RESET  pin is being used as a \nmethod of setting the value of the mode pins, the effects of an \nemulator reset must be taken into consideration.\nOne method of ensuring that the values located on the mode \npins are those desired is to construct a circuit like the one shown \nin Figure 13 . This circuit forces the value located on the Mode A \npin to logic high, regardless of whether it is latched via the \nRESET  or ERESET  pin.\nThe ICE-Port interface consists  of the following ADSP-218xL \npins: EBR , EINT , EE, EBG , ECLK, ERESET , ELIN, EMS , and \nELOUT.\nThese ADSP-218xL pins must be connected only to the EZ-ICE \nconnector in the target system. These pins have no function \nexcept during emulation, and do not require pull-up or pull-down resistors. The traces for these signals between the \nADSP-218xL and the conn ector must be kept as short as possi-\nble, no longer than 3 inches.\nThe following pins are also  used by the EZ-ICE: BR , BG , RESET , \nand GND.The EZ-ICE uses the EE (emulator enable) signal to take control \nof the ADSP-218xL in the target system. This causes the proces-\nsor to use its ERESET\n, EBR , and EBG  pins instead of the RESET , \nBR, and BG  pins. The BG  output is three-stated. These signals \ndo not need to be jumper-isolated in the system.The EZ-ICE connects to the target system via a ribbon cable and a 14-pin female plug. The female plug is plugged onto the 14-\npin connector (a pin strip header) on the target board.\nTarget Board Connector for EZ-ICE Probe\nThe EZ-ICE connector (a standard pin strip header) is shown in \nFigure 14 . This connector must be added to the target board \ndesign to use the EZ-ICE. Be sure  to allow enough room in the \nsystem to fit the EZ-ICE probe onto the 14-pin connector.\nThe 14-pin, 2-row pin strip header is keyed at the Pin 7 loca-\ntion—Pin 7 must be removed from the header. The pins must \nbe 0.025 inch square and at least 0.20 inch in length. Pin spacing \nshould be 0.1 /H115470.1 inch. The pin strip header must have at least \n0.15 inch clearance on all sides to accept th e EZ-ICE probe plug.\nPin strip headers are available from vendors such as 3M, \nMcKenzie, and Samtec.\nTarget Memory Interface\nFor the target system to be compatible with the EZ-ICE emula-\ntor, it must comply with the following memory interface \nguidelines:\nDesign the Program Memory (PM), Data Memory (DM), Byte \nMemory (BM), I/O Memory (IOM), and Composite Memory (CM) external interfaces to comply with worst-case device \ntiming requirements and switching characteristics as specified \nin this data sheet. The perf ormance of the EZ-ICE may \napproach published worst-case specification for some memory \naccess timing requirements and switching characteristics. \nNote:  If the target does not meet the worst-case chip specifica-\ntion for memory access parameters, the circuitry may not be \nable to be emulated at the de sired CLKIN frequency. Depending \non the severity of the specificat ion violation, th e system may be \ndifficult to manufacture, as DSP components statistically vary in switching characteristic and timing requirements, within pub-\nlished limits.\nRestriction:  All memory strobe si gnals on the ADSP-218xL \n(RD , WR , PMS , DMS , BMS , CMS , and IOMS ) used in the target \nsystem must have 10 k Ω pull-up resistors connected when the \nEZ-ICE is being used. The pu ll-up resistors are necessary Figure 13. Mode A Pin/EZ-ICE CircuitPROGRAMMABLE I/OMODE A/PF0RESETERESET\nADSP-218xL\n1k/H9024Figure 14.

These resistors may be removed \nwhen the EZ-ICE is not being used.\nTarget System Interface Signals\nWhen the EZ-ICE board is instal led, the performance on some \nsystem signals changes. Design th e system to be compatible with \nthe following system in terface signal changes introduced by the \nEZ-ICE board:\n• EZ-ICE emulation introduces an 8 ns propagation \ndelay between the target circuitry and the DSP on the \nRESET  signal.\n• EZ-ICE emulation introduces an 8 ns propagation \ndelay between the target circuitry and the DSP on the BR  \nsignal.\n• EZ-ICE emulation ignores RESET  and BR , when \nsingle-stepping.\n• EZ-ICE emulation ignores RESET  and BR  when in Emula-\ntor Space (DSP halted).\n• EZ-ICE emulation ignores the state of target BR  in certain \nmodes. As a result, the target  system may take control of \nthe DSP’s external memory bus only if bus grant (BG ) is \nasserted by the EZ-ICE board’s DSP.\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION\nThis data sheet provides a general overview of ADSP-218xL series functionality.

Table 10  and Table 11  list the active signals at specific \npins of the DSP during either of the two operating modes (Full Memory or Host). A signal in on e table shares a pin with a sig-\nnal from the other table, with the active signal determined by \nthe mode that is set. For the shared pins and their alternate sig-\nnals (e.g., A4/IAD3), refer to the package pinouts in Table 29 on \nPage 44 and Table 30 on Page 45.VDDINT 4I I nternal VDD (3.3 V) Power (BGA)\nVDDEXT 7I E xternal VDD (3.3 V) Power (BGA)\nGND 20 I Ground (BGA)\nEZ-Port 9 I/O For Emulation Use\n1Interrupt/Flag pins retain both functions concurrently.

For a \ncomplete listing of pr oduct availability, see Ordering Guide on \nPage 47. ESD SENSITIVITY\nTIMING SPECIFICATIONS\nGeneral Notes\nUse the exact timing information given. Do not attempt to derive parameters from the addition or subtraction of others. \nWhile addition or subtraction would yield meaningful results for an individual device, the values given in this data sheet \nreflect statistical variations and worst cases. Consequently, \nparameters cannot be added up meaningfully to derive \nlonger times.\nTiming Notes\nSwitching characteristics specif y how the processor changes its \nsignals. Designers have no cont rol over this timing—circuitry \nexternal to the processor must be designed for compatibility \nwith these signal characteristic s. Switching characteristics tell \nwhat the processor will do in a given circumstance. Switching \ncharacteristics can also be used  to ensure that any timing \nrequirement of a device connected to the processor (such as \nmemory) is satisfied.\nTiming requirements apply to si gnals that are controlled by cir-\ncuitry external to the processor, such as the data input for a read \noperation. Timing requirements guarantee that the processor \noperates correctly with other devices.\nFrequency Dependency For Timing Specifications\ntCK is defined as 0.5 t CKI. The ADSP-218xL uses an input clock \nwith a frequency equal to half th e instruction rate. For example, \na 26 MHz input clock (which is equivalent to 38 ns) yields a \n19 ns processor cycle (equivalent to 52 MHz). t CK values within \nthe range of 0.5 t CKI period should be substituted for all relevant \ntiming parameters to obtain the specification value. \nExample: t CKH = 0.5 t CK – 7 ns = 0.5 (19) – 7 ns = 2.5 nsParameter Rating\nSupply Voltage (V DD)– 0.3 V to +4.6 V\nInput Voltage1\n1Applies to bidirectional pins (D23–0, RFS0, RFS1, SCLK0, SCLK1, TFS0, TFS1, \nA13–1, PF7–0) and input only pins (CLKIN, RESET , BR, DR0, DR1, PWD ).–0.5 V to V DD + 0.5 V\nOutput Voltage Swing2\n2Applies to output pins (BG , PMS , DMS , BMS , IOMS , CMS , RD , WR , PWDACK, \nA0, DT0, DT1, CLKOUT, FL2–0, BGH ).–0.5 V to V DD +0.5 V\nOperating Temperature Range –40°C to +85°C\nStorage Temperature Range –65°C to +150°C\nFigure 15.

C | Page 43  of 48 | January 2008TEST CONDITIONS\nFigure 44  shows voltage reference levels for all ac measurements \n(except output disable/enable).\nOutput Disable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be disabled when they have \nstopped driving and started a transition from the measured out-\nput high or low voltage to a high impedance state. The output disable time (t\nDIS) is the difference of t MEASURED  and t DECAY , as \nshown in Figure 45 . The time is the interv al from when a refer-\nence signal reaches a high or low voltage level to when the output voltages have changed by  0.5 V from the measured out-\nput high or low voltage. \nThe decay time, t DECAY , is dependent on the capacitive load, C L, \nand the current load, i L, on the output pin. It can be approxi-\nmated by the following equation:\nfrom which\nis calculated. If multiple pins (such as the data bus) are disabled, \nthe measurement value is that of the last pin to stop driving.\nOutput Enable Time\nOutput pins are considered to be enabled when they have made \na transition from a high-impedance state to when they start driving. The output enable time (t\nENA) is the interval from when \na reference signal reaches a high or low voltage level to when the \noutput has reached a specified high or low trip point, as shown in Figure 45 . If multiple pins (such as the data bus) are enabled, \nthe measurement value is that of the first pin to start driving. ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONSFigure 44.
