High-impedance input to the reset comparator. Connect this pin to the center point of an\nexternal resistor voltage-divider network to set the reset threshold voltage. The reset threshold voltage is\ncalculated as follows: V RST = 1.22 x (R1 + R2)/R2 (see the Typical Operating Circuit ).\n2 GND Ground\n3 SRTSet Reset-Timeout Input. Connect a capacitor between this input and ground to select the reset timeout\nperiod (t RP). Determine the period as follows: t RP = 2.67 x C SRT, with C SRT in pF and t RP in µs (see the\nTypical Operating Circuit ).\n4S W TSet Watchdog-Timeout Input. Connect a capacitor between this input and ground to select the basic\nwatchdog timeout period (t WD). Determine the period as follows: t WD = 2.67 x C SWT, with C SWT in pF and\ntWD in µs. The watchdog function can be disabled by connecting this pin to ground.\n5 WDSWatchdog-Select Input. This input selects the watchdog mode. Connect to ground to select normal mode\nand the basic watchdog timeout period. Connect to V CC to select extended mode, multiplying the basic\ntimeout period by a factor of 500. A change in the state of this pin resets the watchdog timer to zero.\n6 WDIWatchdog Input. A rising or falling transition must occur on this input within the selected watchdog timeout\nperiod, or a reset pulse will occur. The capacitor value selected for SWT and the state of WDS determine\nthe watchdog timeout period. The watchdog timer clears and restarts when a transition occurs on WDI or\nWDS. The watchdog timer is cleared when reset is asserted and restarted after reset deasserts. In the\nextended watchdog mode (WDS = V CC), the watchdog function can be disabled by driving WDI with a\nthree-stated driver or by leaving WDI unconnected.\nOpen-Drain, Active-Low Reset\nOutput (MAX6301)RESET\n(MAX6301/\nMAX6303)Push-Pull, Active-Low Reset\nOutput (MAX6303)RESET  changes from high to low whenever the monitored voltage (V IN)\ndrops below the selected reset threshold (V RST).

The watchdog timer\ntriggers a reset pulse (t RP) whenever the watchdog timeout period (t WD)\nis exceeded.\n8V CC Supply Voltage. Bypass to ground with a 0.1µF capacitor placed as close as possible to the pin.\nDetailed Description\nReset Function/Output\nThe reset output is typically connected to the reset input\nof a µP. A µP’s reset input starts or restarts the µP in aknown state. The MAX6301–MAX6304 µP supervisorycircuits provide the reset logic to prevent code-executionerrors during power-up, power-down, and brownoutconditions (see the \nTypical Operating Circuit ).\nFor the MAX6301/MAX6303, RESET changes from high\nto low whenever the monitored voltage (V IN) drops\nbelow the reset threshold voltage (V RST). RESET\nremains low as long as V INis below V RST. Once V IN\nexceeds V RST, RESET remains low for the reset timeout\nperiod, then goes high. When a reset is asserted due toa watchdog timeout condition, RESET stays low for the\nreset timeout period. Any time reset asserts, the watch-dog timer clears. At the end of the reset timeout period,RESET goes high and the watchdog timer is restarted\nfrom zero. If the watchdog timeout period is exceededagain, then RESET goes low again. This cycle contin-\nues unless WDI receives a transition.\nOn power-up, once V\nCCreaches 1V, RESET is guaran-\nteed to be a logic-low. For information about applica-tions where V\nCCis less than 1V, see the Ensuring a\nValid RESET /RESET Output Down to V CC= 0V (MAX6303/\nMAX6304) section. As V CCrises, RESET remains low.\nWhen V INrises above V RST, the reset timer starts and\nRESET remains low. When the reset timeout period\nends, RESET goes high.\nOn power-down, once V INgoes below V RST, RESET\ngoes low and is guaranteed to be low until V CCdrops\nbelow 1V. For information about applications whereV\nCCis less than 1V, see the Ensuring a Valid\nRESET /RESET Output Down to V CC= 0V (MAX6303/\nMAX6304) section.\nThe MAX6302/MAX6304 active-high RESET output is\nthe inverse of the MAX6301/MAX6303 active-lowRESET output, and is guaranteed valid for V\nCC> 1.31V.\nReset Threshold\nThese supervisors monitor the voltage on RESET IN.\nThe MAX6301–MAX6304 have an adjustable resetthreshold voltage (V\nRST) set with an external resistor\nvoltage-divider (Figure 1). Use the following formula tocalculate V\nRST(the point at which the monitored voltage\ntriggers a reset):\nwhere V RSTis the desired reset threshold voltage and\nVTHis the reset input threshold (1.22V). Resistors R1and R2 can have very high values to minimize current\nconsumption. Set R2 to some conveniently high value(1MΩ, for example) and calculate R1 based on the desired\nreset threshold voltage, using the following formula:\nWatchdog Timer\nThe watchdog circuit monitors the µP’s activity. If the µPdoes not toggle the watchdog input (WDI) within t\nWD\n(user selected), reset asserts. The internal watchdogtimer is cleared by reset, by a transition at WDI (whichcan detect pulses as short as 30ns), or by a transitionat WDS. The watchdog timer remains cleared whilereset is asserted; as soon as reset is released, the timerstarts counting (Figure 2).\nThe MAX6301–MAX6304 feature two modes of watchdog\ntimer operation: normal mode and extended mode. Innormal mode (WDS = GND), the watchdog timeoutperiod is determined by the value of the capacitor con-nected between SWT and ground (see the \nSelecting\nthe Reset and Watchdog Timeout Capacitor section). In\nextended mode (WDS = V CC), the watchdog timeout\nperiod is multiplied by 500. For example, in the extendedmode, a 1µF capacitor gives a watchdog timeout periodof 22 minutes (see the Extended-Mode WatchdogTimeout Period vs. C\nSWT graph in the Typical\nOperating Characteristics ).\nIn extended mode, the watchdog function can be\ndisabled by leaving WDI unconnected or by three-statingthe driver connected to WDI. In this mode, the watchdoginput is internally driven low during the watchdog timeoutperiod, then momentarily pulses high, resetting theR1 R2V\nV1RST\nTH=× −⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟() Ω\nVVR 1 R 2\nR2 V RSTTH\n=×+()()0.1µF\nMAX6301\nMAX6302MAX6303MAX6304VCC RESET IN\nR2R1VIN\nVRST = 1.22 (R1 + R2)R2\nMAX6301–MAX6304+5V, Low-Power µP Supervisory Circuits \nwith Adjustable Reset/Watchdog\n6 _______________________________________________________________________________________Figure 1.

When WDI is left unconnected, the\nwatchdog timer is cleared by this internal driver justbefore the timeout period is reached (the internal driverpulls WDI high at about 94% of t\nWD). When WDI is\nthree-stated, the maximum allowable leakage current ofthe device driving WDI is 10µA.\nIn normal mode (WDS = GND), the watchdog timer\ncannot be disabled by three-stating WDI. WDI is ahigh-impedance input in this mode. Do not leave WDIunconnected in normal mode.\nApplications Information\nSelecting the Reset and Watchdog\nTimeout Capacitor\nThe reset timeout period is adjustable to accommodate\na variety of µP applications. Adjust the reset timeoutperiod (t\nRP) by connecting a specific value capacitor\n(CSRT) between SRT and ground (Figure 3).

Ceramic is recommended.\nThe watchdog timeout period is adjustable to accom-\nmodate a variety of µP applications. With this feature,the watchdog timeout can be optimized for softwareexecution. The programmer can determine how oftenthe watchdog timer should be serviced. Adjust thewatchdog timeout period (t\nWD) by connecting a specif-\nic value capacitor (C SWT) between SWT and ground\n(Figure 3). For normal-mode operation, calculate thewatchdog timeout capacitor as follows:\nC\nSWT= tWD/2.67\nwhere C SWT is in pF and t WDis in µs. C SWT must be a\nlow-leakage (< 10nA) type capacitor. Ceramic isrecommended.\nMonitoring Voltages Other than V CC\nThe Typical Operating Circuit monitors V CC. Voltages\nother than V CCcan easily be monitored, as shown in\nFigure 4. Calculate V RST as shown in the Reset\nThreshold section.\nWake-Up Timer\nIn some applications, it is advantageous to put a µPinto sleep mode, periodically wake it up to performchecks and/or tasks, then put it back into sleep mode.The MAX6301 family of supervisors can easily accom-modate this technique. Figure 5 illustrates an exampleusing the MAX6302 and an 80C51.\nIn Figure 5, just before the µC puts itself into sleep\nmode, it pulls WDS high. The µC’s I/O pins maintaintheir logic levels while in sleep mode and WDS remainshigh. This places the MAX6302 in extended mode,increasing the watchdog timeout 500 times. When thewatchdog timeout period ends, a reset is applied onthe 80C51, waking it up to perform tasks. While the µPis performing tasks, the 80C51 pulls WDS low (select-ing normal mode), and the MAX6302 monitors the µPfor hang-ups. When the µP finishes its tasks, it putsitself back into sleep mode, drives WDS high, andstarts the cycle over again. This is a power-saving tech-nique, since the µP is operating only part of the timeand the MAX6302 has very low quiescent current.\nAdding a Manual Reset Function\nA manual reset option can easily be implemented by con-necting a normally open momentary switch in parallel with\nR2 (Figure 6). When the switch is closed, the voltage onRESET IN goes to zero, initiating a reset. When theswitch is released, the reset remains asserted for thereset timeout period and then is cleared. The pushbut-ton switch is effectively debounced by the reset timer.+5V, Low-Power µP Supervisory Circuits \nwith Adjustable Reset/Watchdog\n8 _______________________________________________________________________________________0.1µFMAX6301\nMAX6302MAX6303MAX6304VCC RESET IN\nR2R1VIN\nVRST = 1.22 (R1 + R2)R2VCC\nFigure 4.

Adding a Manual Reset Function\nInterfacing to µPs with\nBidirectional Reset Pins\nSince RESET is open-drain, the MAX6301 interfaces\neasily with µPs that have bidirectional reset pins, suchas the Motorola 68HC11 (Figure 7). Connecting RESET\ndirectly to the µP’s reset pin with a single pullup allowseither device to assert reset.\nNegative-Going V CCTransients\nIn addition to issuing a reset to the µP during power-up,power-down, and brownout conditions, these supervisorsare relatively immune to short-duration negative-goingtransients (glitches). The Maximum Transient Duration vs.Reset Threshold Overdrive graph in the \nTypical\nOperating Characteristics shows this relationship.\nThe area below the curves of the graph is the region in\nwhich these devices typically do not generate a resetpulse. This graph was generated using a negative-going pulse applied to V\nIN, starting above the actual\nreset threshold (V RST) and ending below it by the mag-\nnitude indicated (reset-threshold overdrive). As themagnitude of the transient increases (farther below thereset threshold), the maximum allowable pulse widthdecreases. Typically, a V\nCCtransient that goes 100mV\nbelow the reset threshold and lasts 50µs or less will notcause a reset pulse to be issued.Watchdog Input Current\nExtended Mode\nIn extended mode (WDS = V CC), the WDI input is inter-\nnally driven through a buffer and series resistor fromthe watchdog counter (Figure 8). When WDI is leftunconnected, the watchdog timer is serviced within thewatchdog timeout period by a very brief low-high-lowpulse from the counter chain. For minimum watchdoginput current (minimum overall power consumption),leave WDI low for the majority of the watchdog timeoutperiod, pulsing it low-high-low (> 30ns) once within theperiod to reset the watchdog timer. If instead WDI isexternally driven high for the majority of the timeoutperiod, typically 70µA can flow into WDI.\nNormal Mode\nIn normal mode (WDS = GND), the internal buffer thatdrives WDI is disabled. In this mode, WDI is a standardCMOS input and leakage current is typically 100pA,regardless of whether WDI is high or low.\nEnsuring a Valid RESET /RESET Output\nDown to V CC= 0V (MAX6303/MAX6304)\nWhen V CCfalls below 1V, RESET /RESET current sinking\n(sourcing) capabilities decline drastically. In the caseof the MAX6303, high-impedance CMOS-logic inputsconnected to RESET can drift to undetermined\nvoltages. This presents no problem in most applica-tions, since most µPs and other circuitry do not operatewith V\nCCbelow 1V.\nMAX6301–MAX6304+5V, Low-Power µP Supervisory Circuits \nwith Adjustable Reset/Watchdog\n_______________________________________________________________________________________ 9MAX6301\nVCC\nRESETVCC VCC\nRESETGNDµPRESET TO \nOTHER SYSTEM COMPONENTS\n0.1µF\n4.7kΩ\nFigure 7.

Watchdog Input Structure\nMAX6301–MAX6304In those applications where RESET must be valid down\nto 0V, adding a pulldown resistor between RESET and\nground sinks any stray leakage currents, holdingRESET low (Figure 9). The value of the pulldown resistor\nis not critical; 100k Ωis large enough not to load RESET\nand small enough to pull RESET to ground. For applica-\ntions using the MAX6304, a 100k Ωpullup resistor\nbetween RESET and V\nCCwill hold RESET high when\nVCCfalls below 1V (Figure 10).\nWatchdog-Software Considerations\nTo help the watchdog timer monitor software executionmore closely, set and reset the watchdog input at differ-ent points in the program, rather than pulsing thewatchdog input high-low-high or low-high-low. Thistechnique avoids a stuck loop in which the watchdogtimer would continue to be reset within the loop, keepingthe watchdog from timing out.\nFigure 11 shows an example of a flow diagram where\nthe I/O driving the watchdog input is set high at thebeginning of the program, set low at the beginning ofevery subroutine or loop, then set high again when theprogram returns to the beginning. If the program shouldhang in any subroutine the problem would quickly becorrected, since the I/O is continually set low and thewatchdog timer is allowed to time out, causing a resetor interrupt to be issued. When using extended mode,as described in the \nWatchdog Input Current section,\nthis scheme does result in higher average WDI inputcurrent than does the method of leaving WDI low for themajority of the timeout period and periodically pulsing itlow-high-low.\nLayout Considerations\nSRT and SWT are precision current sources. Whendeveloping the layout for the application, be careful tominimize board capacitance and leakage currentsaround these pins. Traces connected to these pinsshould be kept as short as possible. Traces carrying\nhigh-speed digital signals and traces with large voltagepotentials should be routed as far from these pins aspossible. Leakage currents and stray capacitance(e.g., a scope probe) at these pins could cause errorsin the reset and/or watchdog timeout period. Whenevaluating these parts, use clean prototype boards toensure accurate reset and watchdog timeout periods.\nRESET IN is a high-impedance input that is typically\ndriven by a high-impedance resistor-divider network(e.g., 1M Ωto 10MΩ). Minimize coupling to transient sig-\nnals by keeping the connections to this input short. AnyDC leakage current at RESET IN (e.g., a scope probe)causes errors in the programmed reset threshold. Notethat sensitive pins are located on the GND side of thedevice, away from the digital I/O, to simplify board layout.+5V, Low-Power µP Supervisory Circuits \nwith Adjustable Reset/Watchdog\n10 ______________________________________________________________________________________MAX6303\nVCC\nRESETVCC\nGND0.1µF\n100kΩ\nFigure 9.
