linear-voltage regulator with inputs that can beashigh as30V.The TLV760\nfeatures quasi LDO architecture ,which allows theusage oflow ESR capacitors attheoutput. Aceramic\ncapacitor with acapacitance value greater than orequal to0.1µFisadequate tokeep thelinear regulator in\nstable operation. Thedevice hasarugged active junction thermal protection mechanism.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Thermal Protection\nThe TLV760 contains anactive thermal protection mechanism, which limits thejunction temperature to150°C.\nThis protection comes into action when thethermal junction temperature ofthedevice tries toexceed 150°C.\nTheoutput current ofthedevice islimited orfolded back tomaintain thejunction temperature.\nThethermal protection follows Equation 1\nwhere\n•PD=(VIN–VOUT)IOUT\n•TJisthejunction temperature\n•RθJAisthejunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (1)\nWhen ahigh drop outcondition occurs resulting inhigher power dissipation across thedevice theoutput current\nislimited tomaintain aconstant junction temperature of150°C.This rugged feature protects thedevice from\nhigher power dissipation applications aswellastheshort toground attheoutput.\nThis internal protection circuitry ofTLV760 isintended toprotect thedevices against thermal overload conditions.\nThe circuitry isnotintended toreplace proper heat sinking. Continuously running theTLV760 into thermal\nprotection degrades device reliability.\nForreliable operation, limit junction temperature toamaximum of125°C.Toestimate thethermal margin ina\ngiven layout, increase theambient temperature until thethermal protection istriggered using worst case load and\nhighest input voltage conditions.\n10TLV760\nSNVSAV1A –JUNE 2017 –REVISED OCTOBER 2017 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TLV760Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedFeature Description (continued)\n7.3.2 Dropout Voltage\nThe TLV760 isabipolar device with quasi LDO architecture .Being abipolar device thedropout voltage ofthe\ndevice does notchange significantly with output load current. The device has amaximum dropout across\ntemperature of1.2Vat100-mA load current, which isasignificant improvement over thetraditional LM78Lxx\ndevices.\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Normal Operation\nThe TLV760 operates with aninput upto30V.ItstinySOT-23 package and quasi-LDO architecture makes it\nsuitable forproviding avery tiny100-mA bias supply.

TI’scustomers are\nresponsible fordetermining suitability ofcomponents fortheir purposes. Customers should\nvalidate andtesttheir design implementation toconfirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\nThe TLV760 isafixed output device which need only input and output capacitors tofunction. This section\ndiscusses thekeyaspects toimplement thislinear regulator intypical applications.\n8.1.1 Fixed Output\nTLV760 comes infixed output voltage options, 3.3V,5V,12Vand15V.Toensure theproper regulated output,\ntheinput voltage should begreater than VOUT(nom) +VDO.\n8.1.2 External Capacitors\n8.1.2.1 Input and Output Capacitor Requirements\nAminimum input and output capacitance value of0.1µFisrequired forstability and adequate transient\nperformance. There isnospecific equivalent series resistance (ESR) limitation, although excessively high ESR\ncompromises transient performance. There isnospecific limitation onamaximum capacitance value ontheinput\northeoutput. However while selecting acapacitor, derating factors onthecapacitance value should be\nconsidered. Use C0G, X7R, orX5R-type ceramic capacitors because these capacitors have minimal variation in\ncapacitance value andESR over temperature.\n8.1.2.2 Load-Step Transient Response\nThe load-step transient response istheoutput voltage response bythelinear regulator toastep change inload\ncurrent. The depth ofcharge depletion immediately after theload step isdirectly proportional totheamount of\noutput capacitance. However, larger output capacitances decrease anyvoltage diporpeak occurring during a\nload step, thecontrol-loop bandwidth isalso decreased, thereby slowing theresponse time. TIrecommends to\noptimally scale output capacitors foraspecific application andtestfortheoutput load transients.\n8.1.3 Power Dissipation\nProper consideration should begiven todevice power dissipation, location ofthecircuit ontheprinted circuit\nboard (PCB), and correct sizing ofthethermal plane toensure thedevice reliability. The PCB area around the\nregulator must beasfree aspossible ofother heat-generating devices that cause added thermal stresses. To\nfirst-order approximation, power dissipation intheregulator depends ontheinput-to-output voltage difference and\nload conditions. Power dissipation canbecalculated using Thethermal protection follows Equation 1:\nwhere\n•PD=(VIN–VOUT)IOUT\n•TJisthejunction temperature\n•RθJAisthejunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (2)\nThus, atagiven load current, input and output voltage, maximum power dissipation determines themaximum\nallowable ambient temperature (TA)forthedevice, and vice versa. Power dissipation and junction temperature\naremost often related bythejunction-to-ambient thermal resistance (RθJA)ofthecombined PCB and device\npackage andthetemperature oftheambient air(TA).\nRθJAishighly dependent ontheheat-spreading capability built into theparticular PCB design, and therefore\nvaries according tothetotal copper area, copper weight, and location oftheplanes. The RθJArecorded in\nThermal Information isdetermined bytheJEDEC standard, PCB, andcopper-spreading area andisonly used as\narelative measure ofpackage thermal performance.\nTLV760IN OUT\nGND\n \nCOUT \nCINVIN = 6.5 V V OUT = 5 V\n0.1 µF 0.1 µF\nCopyright © 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated\n12TLV760\nSNVSAV1A –JUNE 2017 –REVISED OCTOBER 2017 www.ti.com\nProduct Folder Links: TLV760Submit Documentation Feedback Copyright ©2017, Texas Instruments IncorporatedApplication Information (continued)\nTLV760 integrates arugged protection where theTJislimited to150°C.The maximum power dissipation\ndepends ontheambient temperature andcanbecalculated using PD=(TJ–TA)/RθJA,forexample, substituting\ntheabsolute maximum junction temperature, 150°CforTJ,50°CforTA,and 275.2 °C/W forRθJA,themaximum\npower that canbedissipated is363 mW.
