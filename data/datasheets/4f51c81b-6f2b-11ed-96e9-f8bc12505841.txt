At 1900\u2009MHz, the amplifier typically provides  \n20.3 dB gain, +28.5 dBm OIP3, and 3.9 dB Nois e Figure \nwhile drawing 45 mA current. The device combines \ndependable performance with consistent quality to maintain \nMTTF values exceeding 100 years at mounting \ntemperatures of +85\u2009°C.  The device is housed in a lead -\nfree/green/RoHS -complian t industry -standard SOT -363 \npackage.  \n \nThe TQP369184 consists of a Darlington -pair amplifier \nusing the high reliability InGaP/GaAs HBT process \ntechnology.  Only DC -blocking capacitors, a bias resistor, \nand an inductive RF choke are required for operation.   \n \nThis broadban d MMIC amplifier can be directly applied to \nvarious current and next generation wireless technologies \nsuch as CDMA, W -CDMA, and LTE.  In addition, the \nTQP369184 will work for other applications within the DC \nto 6 GHz frequency range.
