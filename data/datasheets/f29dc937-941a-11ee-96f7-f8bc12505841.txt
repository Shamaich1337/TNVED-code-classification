A reliable and noise less operation\nof the SR system is insured due to the Self Synchronization feature . The\nNCP4305 also utilizes Kelvin connection of the driver to the MOSFETto achieve high efficiency operation at full load and utilizes a light loaddetection architecture to achieve high efficiency at light load.\nThe precise turn−off threshold, extremely low turn−off delay time\nand high sink current capability of the driver allow the maximumsynchronous rectification MOSFET conduction time and enablesmaximum SMPS efficiency. The high accuracy driver and 5 V gate\nclamp enables the use of GaN FETs.\nFeatures\n•Self−Contained Control of Synchronous Rectifier in CCM, DCM and\nQR for Flyback, Forward or LLC Applications\n•Precise True Secondary Zero Current Detection\n•Typically 12 ns Turn off Delay from Current Sense Input to Driver\n•Rugged Current Sense Pin (up to  200 V)\n•Ultrafast T urn−off T rigger Interface/Disable Input (7.5 ns)\n•Adjustable Minimum ON−Time\n•Adjustable Minimum OFF -Time with Ringing Detection\n•Adjustable Maximum ON−Time for CCM Controlling of Primary\nQR Controller\n•Improved Robust Self Synchronization Capability\n•8 A / 4 A Peak Current Sink / Source Drive Capability\n•Operating V oltage Range up to V CC = 35 V\n•Automatic Light−load & Disable Mode\n•Adaptive Gate Drive Clamp\n•GaN Transistor Driving Capability (options A and C)\n•Low Startup and Disable Current Consumption\n•Maximum Operation Frequency up to 1 MHz\n•SOIC -8 and DFN−8 (4x4) and WDFN8 (2x2) Packages\n•These are Pb−Free DevicesTypical Applications\n•Notebook Adapters\n•High Power Density AC/DC Power Supplies (Cell\nPhone Chargers)\n•LCD TVs\n•All SMPS with High Efficiency RequirementsSOIC−8\nD SUFFIX\nCASE 751MARKING\nDIAGRAMS\n4305x = Specific Device Code\nx = A, B, C, D or Q\nA = Assembly LocationL = Wafer LotY = Year\nW = Work Week\nM = Date Code\n/C0071 = Pb−Free Package\n18\nNCP4305x\nALYW /C0071\n /C0071\n18\n(Note: Microdot may be in either location)4305x\nALYW /C0071\n/C00711\nDFN8\nMN SUFFIX\nCASE 488AFwww.onsemi.com\nSee detailed ordering and shipping information on page 49 o f\nthis data sheet.ORDERING INFORMATION5xM /C0071\n/C00711\nWDFN8\nMT SUFFIX\nCASE 511AT\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n2Figure 1.

This controller features a high current gatedriver along with high−speed logic circuitry to provide\nappropriately timed drive signals to a synchronous\nrectification MOSFET. With its novel architecture, theNCP4305 has enough versatility to keep the synchronous\nrectification system efficient under any operating mode .\nThe NCP4305 works from an available voltage with range\nfrom 4 V (A, D & Q options) or 8 V (B & C options) to 35 V\n(typical). The wide V\nCC range allows direct connection to\nthe SMPS output voltage of most adapters such as\nnotebooks, cell phone chargers and LCD TV adapters.\nPrecise turn-off threshold of the current sense comparator\ntogether with an accurate offset current source allows the\nuser to adjust for any required turn -off current threshold of\nthe SR MOSFET switch using a single resistor . Compared\nto other SR controllers that provide turn -off thresholds in the\nrange of −10 mV to −5 mV , the NCP4305 offers a turn -off\nthreshold of 0 mV . When using a low R DS(on)  SR (1 m /C0087)\nMOSFET our competition, with a −10 mV turn off, will turn\noff with 10 A still flowing through the SR FET, while our0 mV turn off turns off the FET at 0 A; significantly\nreducing the turn -off current threshold and improving\nefficiency. Many of the competitor parts maintain a drainsource voltage across the MOSFET causing the SRMOSFET to operate in the linear region to reduce turn−offtime. Thanks to the 8 A sink current of the NCP4305\nsignificantly reduces turn off time allowing for a minimal\ndrain source voltage to be utilized and efficiencymaximized.\nTo overcome false triggering issues after turn -on and\nturn−off events , the NCP4305 provides adjustable minimum\non-time and off -time blanking periods. Blanking times can\nbe adjusted independently of IC VCC using externalresistors connected to GND. If needed, blanking periods can\nbe modulated using additional components.\nAn extremely fast turn−off comparator, implemented on\nthe current sense pin, allows for NCP4305 implementationin CCM applications without any additional components orexternal triggering.\nAn ultrafast trigger input offers the possibility to further\nincrease efficiency of synchronous rectification systemsoperated in CCM mode (for example, CCM flyback orforward). The time delay from trigger input to driver turn off\nevent is t\nPD_TRIG . Additionally , the trigger input can be used\nto disable the IC and activate a low consumption standby\nmode. This feature can be used to decrease standby\nconsumption of an SMPS. If the trigger input is not wanted\nthan the trigger pin can be tied to GND or an option can bechosen to replace this pin with a MAX_TON input.\nAn output driver features capability to keep SR transistor\nclosed even when there is no supply voltage for NCP4305.SR transistor drain voltage goes up and down during SMPS\noperation and this is transferred through drain gate\ncapacitance to gate and may turn on transistor. NCP4305\nuses this pulsing voltage at SR transistor gate (DRV pin) and\nuses it internally to provide enough supply to activateinternal driver sink transistor. DRV voltage is pulled low(not to zero) thanks to this feature and eliminate the risk ofturned on SR transistor before enough V\nCC is applied to\nNCP4305.\nSome IC versions include a MAX_TON circuit that helps\na quasi resonant (QR) controller to work in CCM mode\nwhen a heavy load is present like in the example of a\nprinter’s motor starting up .\nFinally , the NCP4305 features a special pin (LLD) that\ncan be used to reduce gate driver voltage clamp according\nto application load conditions . This feature helps to reduce\nissues with transition from disabled driver to full driveroutput voltage and back. Disable state can be also activated\nthrough this pin to decrease power consumption in no load\nconditions. If the LLD feature is not wanted then the LLDpin can be tied to GND.\nCurrent Sense Input\nFigure 44 shows the internal connection of the CS\ncircuitry on the current sense input. When the voltage on the\nsecondary w inding of the SMPS reverses, the body diode of\nM1 starts to conduct current and the voltage of M1’s draindrops approximately to −1 V. The CS pin sources current of\n100 /C0109A that creates a voltage drop on the R\nSHIFT_CS  resistor\n(resistor is optional, we recommend shorting this resistor).Once the voltage on the CS pin is lower than V\nTH_CS_ON\nthreshold, M1 is turned−on. Because of parasiticimpedances, significant ringing can occur in the application.\nTo overcome false sudden turn−off due to mentionedringing, the minimum conduction time of the SR MOSFET\nis activated. Minimum conduction time can be adjustedusing the R\nMIN_TON  resistor.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n16\nFigure 44. Current Sensing Circuitry Functionality\nThe SR MOSFET is turned -off as soon as the voltage on\nthe CS pin is higher than V TH_CS_OFF  (typically −0.5 mV\nminus any voltage dropped on the optional R SHIFT_CS ). For\nthe same ringing reason, a minimum off -time timer is\nasserted once the V CS goes above V TH_CS_RESET . The\nminimum off -time can be externally adjusted using\nRMIN_TOFF  resistor . The minimum off−time generator can\nbe re−triggered by MIN_TOFF reset comparator if somespurious ringing occurs on the CS input after SR MOSFET\nturn−off event. This feature significantly simplifies SR\nsystem implementation in flyback converters.\nIn an LLC converter the SR MOSFET M1 channel\nconducts while secondary side current is decreasing (refer toFigure 45) . Therefore the turn−off current depends on\nMOSFET R\nDSON . The −0.5 mV threshold provides an\noptimum switching period usage while keeping enough time\nmargin for the gate turn -off. The R SHIFT_CS  resistor\nprovides the designer with the possibility to modify(increase) the actual turn−on and turn−off secondary current\nthresholds . To ensure proper switching, the min_t\nOFF timer\nis reset, when the V DS of the MOSFET rings and falls down\npast the V TH_CS_RESET . The minimum off−time needs to\nexpire before another drive pulse can be initiated. Minimum\noff−time timer is started again when V DS rises above\nVTH_CS_RESET .\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n17VDS=V CS\nVTH_CS_RESET –( R SHIFT_CS *ICS)\nVTH_CS_OFF –( R SHIFT_CS *ICS)\nVTH_CS_ON –( R SHIFT_CS *ICS)\nVDRV\nMin ON− time\ntMin OFF− timeMin t OFFtimer was\nstopped here because\nof V CS<VTH_CS_RESETtMIN_TON\ntMIN_TOFFISEC\nThe t MIN_TON and t MIN_TOFF are adjustable by R MIN_TON and R MIN_TOFF resistorsTurn− on delay Turn − off delay\nFigure 45.

The current that flows\nthrough the SR MOSFET experiences a high /C0068i(t)//C0068t that\ninduces an error voltage on the SR MOSFET leads due totheir parasitic inductance. This error voltage is proportional\nto the derivative of the SR MOSFET current; and shifts the\nCS input voltage to zero when significant current still flows\nthrough the MOSFET channel. As a result, the SR MOSFET\nis turned−off prematurely and the efficiency of the SMPS is\nnot optimized − refer to Figure 48 for a better understanding.\nFigure 47. SR System Connection Including MOSFET and Layout Parasitic Inductances in LLC Application\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n19\nFigure 48. Waveforms From SR System Implemented in LLC Application and Using MOSFET in TO220 Package\nWith Long Leads − SR MOSFET channel Conduction Time is Reduced\nNote that the ef ficiency impact caused by the error voltage\ndue to the parasitic inductance increases with lower\nMOSFETs R DS(on)  and/or higher operating frequency .\nIt is thus beneficial to minimize SR MOSFET package\nleads length in order to maximize application ef ficiency. The\noptimum solution for applications with high secondarycurrent /C0068i//C0068t and high operating frequency is to use\nlead−less SR MOSFET i.e. SR MOSFET in SMT package.\nThe parasitic inductance of a SMT package is negligible\ncausing insignificant CS turn−off threshold shift and thus\nminimum impact to efficiency (refer to Figure 49).\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n20\nFigure 49. Waveforms from SR System Implemented in LLC Application and Using MOSFET in SMT Package with\nMinimized Parasitic Inductance − SR MOSFET Channel Conduction Time is Optimized\nIt can be deduced from the above paragraphs on the\ninduced error voltage and parameter tables that turn−offthreshold precision is quite critical. If we consider a SR\nMOSFET with R\nDS(on)  of 1 m /C0087, the 1 mV error voltage on\nthe CS pin results in a 1 A turn -off current threshold\ndifference; thus the PCB layout is very critical when\nimplementing the SR system. Note that the CS turn -off\ncomparator is referred to the GND pin. Any parasiticimpedance (resistive or inductive − even on the magnitude\nof m/C0087 and nH values) can cause a high error voltage that is\nthen evaluated by the CS comparator. Ideally the CS\nturn−off comparator should detect voltage that is caused by\nsecondary current directly on the SR MOSFET channelresistance. In reality there will be small parasitic impedance\non the CS path due to the bonding wires, leads and soldering.\nTo assure the best ef ficiency results , a Kelvin connection ofthe SR controller to the power circuitry should be\nimplemented. The GND pin should be connected to the SR\nMOSFET source soldering point and current sense pin\nshould be connected to the SR MOSFET drain soldering\npoint − refer to Figure 47 . Using a Kelvin connection will\navoid any impact of PCB layout parasitic elements on the SR\ncontroller functionality; SR MOSFET parasitic elementswill still play a role in attaining an error voltage. Figure 50and Figure 51 show examples of SR system layouts using\nMOSFETs in TO220 and SMT packages . It is evident that\nthe MOSFET leads should be as short as possible to\nminimize parasitic inductances when using packages with\nleads (like TO220). Figure 51 shows how to layout designwith two SR MOSFETs in parallel. It has to be noted that it\nis not easy task and designer has to paid lot of attention to dosymmetric Kelvin connection.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n21\nFigure 50. Recommended Layout When Using SR\nMOSFET in TO220 Package\nFigure 51. Recommended Layout When Using SR\nMOSFET in SMT Package (2x SO8 FL)\nTrigger/Disable input\nThe NCP4305 features an ultrafast trigger input that\nexhibits a maximum of t PD_TRIG  delay from its activation tothe start of SR MOSFET turn−off of process. This input can\nbe used in applications operated in deep ContinuesConduction Mode (CCM) to further increase efficiency\nand/or to activate disable mode of the SR driver in which the\nconsumption of the NCP4305 is reduced to maximum ofI\nCC_DIS .\nNCP4305 is capable to turn−off the SR MOSFET reliably\nin CCM applications just based on CS pin information only,without using the trigger input. However, natural delay ofthe ZCD comparator and DRV turn−off delay increaseoverlap between primary and secondary MOSFETs\nswitching (also known as cross conduction). If one wants to\nachieve absolutely maximum efficiency with deep CCM\napplications , then the trigger signal coming from the\nprimary side should be applied to the trigger pin. The trigger\ninput then turns the SR MOSFET off slightly before thesecondary winding voltage reverses. There are severalpossibilities for transferring the trigger signal from the\nprimary to the secondary side − refer to Figures 66 and 67 .\nThe trigger signal is blanked for  t\nTRIGBLANK  after the\nDRV turn−on process has begun. The blanking technique isused to increase trigger input noise immunity against theparasitic ringing that is present during the turn on processdue to the SMPS layout. The trigger input is supersedes the\nCS input except trigger blanking period . TRIG/DIS signal\nturns the SR MOSFET off or prohibits its turn−on when the\nTrigger/Disable pin is pulled above V\nTRIG_TH .\nThe SR controller enters disable mode when the trigger\npin is pulled−up for more than t DIS_TIM . In disable mode the\nIC consumption is significantly reduced. To recover fromdisable mode and enter normal operation, the TRIG/DIS pin\nis pulled low at least for t\nDIS_END .\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n22VDS=V CS\nVTH_CS _RESET\nVTH_CS _OFF\nVTH_CS _ON\nVTRIG/DIS\nVDRV\ntt1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6 t7 t8 t9\nFigure 52. Trigger Input Functionality Waveforms Using the Trigger to Turn−off and Block the DRV Signa l\nFigure 52 shows basic Trigger/Disable input\nfunctionality. At t1 the Trigger/Disable pin is pulled low to\nenter into normal operation. At t2 the CS pin is dropped\nbelow the V TH_CS_ON , signaling to the NCP4305 to start to\nturn the SR MOSFET on. At t3 the NCP4305 begins to drive\nthe MOSFET. At t4, the SR MOSFET is conducting and theTrigger/Disable pin is pulled high. This high signal on theTrigger/Disable pin almost immediately turns off the drive\nto the SR MOSFET, turning off the MOSFET. The DRV isnot turned−on in other case (t6) because the trigger pin is\nhigh in the time when CS pin signal crosses turn−on\nthreshold. This figure clearly shows that the DRV can beasserted only on fa lling edge of the CS pin signal in case the\ntrigger input is at low level (t2).\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n23VDS=V CS\nVTH_CS_RESET\nVTH_CS_OFF\nVTH_CS_ON\nVTRIG/DIS\nTRIG/DIS blank\nMin ON− time\nVDRVtTRIGBLANK\nt t1 t2 t3\nFigure 53. Trigger Input Functionality Waveforms − Trigger Blanking\nIn Figure 53 above, at time t1 the CS pin falls below the\nVTH_CS_ON  while the Trigger is low setting in motion the\nDRV signal that appears at t2. At time t2 the DRV signal and\nTrigger blanking clock begin. Trigger/Disable signal goes\nhigh shortly after time t2. Due to the Trigger blanking clock\n(tTRIG_BLANK ) the Trigger’s high signal does not affect the\nDRV signal until the t TRIGBLANK  timer has expired. At time\nt3 the Trigger/Disable signal is re evaluated and the DRVsignal is turned off. The TRIG/DIS input is blanked fort\nTRIGBLANK  after DRV set signal to avoid undesirablebehavior during SR MOSFET turn−on event. The blanking\ntime in combination with high threshold voltage(V\nTRIG_TH ) prevent triggering on ringing and spikes that are\npresent on the TRIG/DIS input pin during the SR MOSFET\nturn−on process. Controller’s response to the narrow pulse\non the Trigger/Disable pin is depicted in Figure 53 − thisshort trigger pulse enables to turn the DRV on fort\nTRIG_BLANK . Note that this case is valid only if device not\nentered disable mode before.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n24VDS=V CS\nVTH_CS_RESET\nVTH_CS_OFF\nVTH_CS_ON\nVTRIG/DIS\nTRIG/DIS blank\nMIN ON− TIME\nVDRVtTRIGBLANK\nt t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t5 t6\nFigure 54.

The advantage of the trigger blanking\ntime during DRV turn−on is evident from Figure 54 since it\nacts like a filter on the Trigger/Disable pin. Rising edge ofthe DRV signal may cause spikes on the trigger input. If it\nwasn’t for the TRIG/DIS blanking these spikes, incombination with ultra−fast performance of the trigger\nlogic, could turn the SR MOSFET off in an inappropriate\ntime.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n25VDS=V CS\nVTH_CS_RESET\nVTH_CS_OFF\nVTH_CS_ON\nVTRIG/DIS\nMin ON−time\nVDRV\nt t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t5\nFigure 55. Trigger Input Functionality Waveforms − Trigger Over Ride, CS Turn Off and Min On−tim e\nFigure 55 depicts all possible driver turn−off events in\ndetails when correct V CC is applied. Controller driver is\ndisabled based on trigger input signal in time t2; the trigger\ninput overrides the minimum on−time period.\nDriver is turned−off according to the CS (V DS) signal (t5\nmarker) and when minimum on−time period elapsedalready. TRIG/DIS signal needs to be LOW during thisevent.\nIf the CS (V\nDS) voltage reaches V TH_CS_OFF  threshold\nbefore minimum on−time period ends (t7) and theTrigger/Disable pin is low the DRV is turned−off on the\nfalling edge of the minimum on−time period (t8 time marker\nin Figure 55). This demonstrates the fact that the Triggerover rides the minimum on−time. Minimum on−time has\nhigher priority than the CS signal .In Figure 56 the trigger input is low the whole time and the\nDRV pulses are purely a function of the CS signal and theminimum on−time. The first DRV pulse terminated based on\nthe CS signal and another two DRV pulses are prolonged till\nthe minimum on−time period end despite the CS signalcrosses the V\nTH_CS_OFF  threshold earlier.\nIf a minimum on−time is too long the situation that occurs\nafter time marker t6 Figure 56 can occur, is not correct andshould be avoided. The minimum t\nON period should be\nselected shorter to overcome situation that the SR MOSFET\nis turned−on for too long time. The secondary current then\nchanges direction and energy flows back to the transformer\nthat result in reduced application efficiency and also inexcessive ringing on the primary and secondary MOSFETs.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n26VDS=V CS\nVTH_CS_RESET\nVTH_CS_OFF\nVTH_CS _ON\nVTRIG/DIS\nMin ON− time\nVDRV\nt t0 t1 t2 t3 t4 t6 t7 t8 t5 t9\nFigure 56.

The trigger signal disables\ndriver at time t2. The trigger drops down to LOW level intime t3, but IC waits for complete minimum off−time.\nMinimum off−time execution is blocked until CS pinvoltage goes above V\nTH_CS_RESET  threshold. Next cycle\nstarts in time t6. The TRIG/DIS is low so driver is enabledand ready to be turned on when V\nDS falls below V TH_CS_ON\nthreshold voltage thus the driver is turned on at time t6.

A\nstart−up event is very similar to an exit from disable mode\nevent. The IC waits for a complete minimum off−time event\n(CS pin voltage is higher than V TH_CS_RESET ) until drive\npulses can continue. Figure 65 shows how the minimumoff−time timer is reset when CS voltage is oscillating\nthrough V\nTH_CS_RESET  level. The NCP4305 starts\noperation at time t1 (time t1 can be seen as a wake−up event\nfrom the disable mode through TRIG/DIS or LLD pin).Internal logic waits for one complete minimum of f−time\nperiod to expire before the NCP4305 can activate the driver\nafter a start−up or wake−up event. The minimum of f−time\ntimer starts to run at time t1, because V\nCS is higher than\nVTH_CS_RESET . The timer is then reset , before its setminimum off−time period expires, at time t2 thanks to CS\nvoltage lower than V TH_CS_RESET  threshold. The\naforementioned reset situation can be seen again at time t3,\nt4, t5 and t6. A complete minimum off−time period elapses\nbetween times t7 and t8 allowing the IC to activate a driveroutput after time t8.\nThe NCP4305 works very well in CCM application\nwithout any triggering method, but using some may improve\noverall operation. Typical application schematics of CCMflyback converters using two different primary triggering\ntechniques can be seen in Figures 66 and 67 . Both provided\nmethods reduce the commutation losses and the SR\nMOSFET drain voltage spike, which results in improved\nefficiency .\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n36Figure 66.

This\nmethod uses auxiliary winding made of triple insulated wire\nplaced close to the primary winding section.  This auxiliary\nwinding provides information about primary turn−on event\nto the SR controller before the secondary winding reverses.This is possible thanks to the leakage between primary and\nsecondary windings that creates natural delay in energytransfer. This technique provides approximately 0.5%\nefficiency improvement when the application is operated in\ndeep CCM and a transformer that has a leakage of 1% ofprimary inductance is used.\nFigure 67. Primary Triggering in Deep CCM Application Using Trigger Transformer − NCP4305A, B, C or D\nApplication from Figure 67  uses an ultra−small trigger\ntransformer to transfer primary turn−on information directly\nfrom the primary controller driver pin to the SR controller\ntrigger input. Because the trigger input is rising edgesensitive, it is not necessary to transmit the entire primary\ndriver pulse to the secondary. The coupling capacitor C5 isused to allow the trigger transformer’s core to reset and also\nto prepare a needle pulse (a pulse with width shorter than\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n37100 ns) to be transmitted to the NCP4305 trigger input.  The\nadvantage of needle trigger pulse usage is that the requiredvolt−second product of the pulse transformer is very low and\nthat allows the designer to use very small and cheap\nmagnetic. The trigger transformer can even be prepared ona small toroidal ferrite core with outer diameter of 4 mm andfour turns for primary and secondary windings to assure\nLprimary = Lsecondary > 10 /C0109H. Proper safety insulation\nbetween primary and secondary sides can be easily assured\nby using triple insulated wire for one or , better , both\nwindings.\nThis primary triggering technique provides\napproximately 0.5% efficiency improvement when theapplication is operated in deep CCM and transformer withleakage of 1% of primary inductance is used.\nIt is also possible to use capacitive coupling (use\nadditional capacitor with safety insulation) between theprimary and secondary to transmit the trigger signal. We do\nnot recommend this technique as the parasitic capacitivecurrents between primary and secondary may affect the\ntrigger signal and thus overall system functionality.\nMinimum t ON and t OFF Adjustment\nThe NCP4305 offers an adjustable minimum on−time and\noff−time blanking periods that ease the implementation of asynchronous rectification system in any SMPS topology.\nThese timers avoid false triggering on the CS input after the\nMOSFET is turned on or off.\nThe adjustment of minimum t\nON and t OFF periods are\ndone based on an internal timing capacitance and externalresistors connected to the GND pin − refer to Figure 68 for\na better understanding.\nFigure 68.

The minimum off−time one−shot generator isrestarted in the case when the CS pin voltage crossesV\nTH_CS_RESET  threshold and MIN_TOFF period is active.\nThe total off -time blanking period is prolonged due to the\nringing in the application (refer to Figure 45) .\nSome applications may require adaptive minimum on and\noff time blanking periods. With NCP4305 it is possible tomodulate blanking periods by using an external NPNtransistor − refer to Figure 71. The modulation signal can be\nderived based on the load current, feedback regulator\nvoltage or other application parameter .\nFigure 71. Possible Connection for MIN_T ON and MIN_T OFF Modulation\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n39Maximum t ON adjustment\nThe NCP4305Q offers an adjustable maximum on−time\n(like the min_t ON and min_t OFF settings shown above) that\ncan be very useful for QR controllers at high loads. Underhigh load conditions the QR controller can operate in CCM\nthanks to this feature. The NCP4305Q version has the ability\nto turn−off the DRV signal to the SR MOSFET before the\nsecondary side current reaches zero. The DRV signal fromthe NCP4305Q can be fed to the primary side through apulse transformer (see Figure 4 for detail) to a transistor onthe primary side to emulate a ZCD event before an actualZCD event occurs. This feature helps to keep the minimumswitching frequency up so that there is better ener gy transfer\nthrough the transformer (a smaller transformer core can be\nused). Also another advantage is that the IC controls the SR\nMOSFET and turns off from secondary side before theprimary side is turned on in CCM to ensure no crossconduction. By controlling the SR MOSFET’s turn offbefore the primary side turn off, producing a zero crossconduction operation, this will improve efficiency.The Internal connection of the MAX_TON feature is\nshown in Figure 72. Figure 72 shows a method that allowsfor a modification of the maximum on−time according to\noutput voltage. At a lower V\nOUT, caused by hard overload\nor at startup, the maximum on−time should be longer than atnominal voltage. Resistor R\nA can be used to modulate\nmaximum on−time according to V OUT or any other\nparameter.\nThe operational waveforms at heavy load in QR type\nSMPS are shown in Figure 73. After t MAX_TON  time is\nexceeded, the synchronous switch is turned off and the\nsecondary current is conducted by the diode. Information\nabout turned off SR MOSFET is transferred by the DRV pin\nthrough a small pulse transformer to the primary side whereit acts on the ZCD detection circuit to allow the primaryswitch to be turned on. Secondary side current disappearsbefore the primary switch is turned on without a possibility\nof cross current condition.\nFigure 72.

Function of MAX_TON Generator in Heavy Load Condition\nAdaptive Gate Driver Clamp and automatic Light Load\nTurn−off\nAs synchronous rectification system significantly\nimproves efficiency in most of SMPS applications duringmedium or full load conditions. However, as the loadreduces into light or no−load conditions the SR MOSFETdriving losses and SR controller consumption become more\ncritical. The NCP4305 offers two key features that help tooptimize application efficiency under light load and no load\nconditions:\n1\nst − The driver clamp voltage is modulated and follows\nthe output load condition. When the output load decreasesthe driver clamp voltage decreases as well. Under heavyload conditions the SR MOSFET’s gate needs to be drivenvery hard to optimize the performance and reduceconduction losses. During light load conditions it is not ascritical to drive the SR MOSFET’ s channel into such a low\nR\nDSON  state. This adaptive gate clamp technique helps to\noptimize efficiency during light load conditions especially\nin LLC applications where the SR MOSFETs with highinput capacitance are used.\nDriver voltage modulation improves the system behavior\nwhen SR controller state is changed in and out of normal or\ndisable modes. Soft transient between drop at body diodeand drop at MOSFET’s R\nDS(on)  only improves stability\nduring load transients.\n2nd − In extremely low load conditions or no load\nconditions the NCP4305 fully disables driver output and\nreduces the internal power consumption when output loaddrops below the level where skip−mode takes place.\nBoth features are controlled by voltage at LLD pin. The\nLLD pin voltage characteristic is shown in Figure 74. Drivervoltage clamp is a linear function of the voltage differencebetween the VCC and LLD pins from V\nLLD_REC  point up to\nVLLD_MAX . A disable mode is available, where the IC\ncurrent consumption is dramatically reduced, when the\ndifference of V CC − VLLD voltage drops below V LLD_DIS .\nWhen the voltage difference between the V CC − VLLD pins\nincrease above V LLC_REC  the disable mode ends and the IC\nregains normal operation. It should be noted that there arealso some time delays to enter and exit from the disablemode. Time waveforms are shown at Figure 75. There is atime, t\nLLD_DISH , that the logic ignores changes from disable\nmode to normal or reversely. There is also some time\ntLLD_DIS_R  that is needed after an exit from the disable mode\nto assure proper internal block biasing before SR controllerstarts work normally.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n41VDRVCLAMP\nVCC−V LLDICC\nVDRVMAX\nVLLD_MAX VLLD_DIS VLLD_REC\nFigure 74.

Different light load detection techniques\nare used in NCP4305 controller to reflect differences in\noperation of both mentioned applications.\nDetail of the light load detection implementation\ntechnique used in NCP4305 in flyback topologies isdisplayed at Figure 76. Using a simple and cost effectivepeak detector implemented with a diode D1, resistors R1through R3 and capacitors C2 and C3, the load level can be\nsensed. Output voltage of this detector on the LLD pin isreferenced to controller VCC with an internal differential\namplifier in NCP4305. The output of the differential\namplifier is then used in two places. First the output is used\nin the driver block for gate drive clamp voltage adjustment.Next, the output signal is evaluated by a no−load detectioncomparator that activates IC disable mode in case the loadis disconnected from the application output.\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n42Figure 76. NCP4305 Light Load and No Load Detection Principle in Flyback Topologies\nOperational waveforms related to the flyback LLD\ncircuitry are provided in Figure 77. The SR MOSFET drain\nvoltage drops to ~ 0 V when I SEC current is flowing. When\nthe SR MOSFET is conducting the capacitor C2 charges−up,\ncausing the difference between the LLD pin and VCC pin to\nincrease, and drop the LLD pin voltage. As the loaddecreases the secondary side currents flows for a shorter ashorter time. C2 has less time to accumulate charge and the\nvoltage on the C2 decreases, because it is discharged by R2and R3. This smaller voltage on C2 will cause the LLD pinvoltage to increase towards V\nCC and the dif ference between\nLLD and V CC will go to zero. The output voltage thendirectly reduces DRV clamp voltage down from its\nmaximum level. The DRV is then fully disabled when ICenters disable mode. The IC exits from disable mode when\ndifference between LLD voltage and V\nCC increases over\nVLLD_REC . Resistors R2 and R3 are also used for voltage\nlevel adjustment and with capacitor C3 form low pass filter\nthat filters relatively high speed ripple at C2. This low passfilter also reduces speed of state change of the SR controller\nfrom normal to disable mode or reversely. Time constantshould be higher than feedback loop time constant to keepwhole system stable.\nFigure 77.

NCP4305 Light Load Detection in LLC Topology\nThe driver clamp modulation waveforms of NCP4305 in\nLLC are provided in Figure 80. The driver clamp voltageclips to its maximum level when LLC operates in normal\nmode. When the LLC starts to operate in skip mode the\ndriver clamp voltage begins to decrease. The specific output\ncurrent level is determined by skip duty cycle and detectioncircuit consists of R1, R2, R3, C2, C3 and diodes D1, D2.\nThe NCP4305 enters disable mode in low load condition,\nwhen V\nCC−VLLD drops below V LLD_DIS  (0.9 V) .

NCP4305 Light Load Detection Behavior in LLC Application – Other Option\nPower Dissipation Calculation\nIt is important to consider the power dissipation in the\nMOSFET driver of a SR system. If no external gate resistor\nis used and the internal gate resistance of the MOSFET isvery low, nearly all energy losses related to gate charge aredissipated in the driver. Thus it is necessary to check the SR\ndriver power losses in the target application to avoid over\ntemperature and to optimize efficiency.\nIn SR systems the body diode of the SR MOSFET starts\nconducting before SR MOSFET is turned−on , because there\nis some delay from V\nTH_CS_ON  detect to turn−on the driver.\nOn the other hand , the SR MOSFET turn off process always\nstarts before the drain to source voltage rises upsignificantly. Therefore , the MOSFET switch always\noperates under Zero V oltage Switching (ZVS) conditionswhen in a synchronous rectification system.\nThe following steps show how to approximately calculate\nthe power dissipation and DIE temperature of the NCP4305\ncontroller. Note that real results can vary due to the effectsof the PCB layout on the thermal resistance.\nStep 1 − MOSFET Gate−to Source Capacitance:\nDuring ZVS operation the gate to drain capacitance does\nnot have a Miller effect like in hard switching systemsbecause the drain to source voltage does not change (or itschange is negligible).\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n47\nFigure 84. Typical MOSFET Capacitances\nDependency on V DS and V GS VoltagesCiss/C0043Cgs/C0041Cgd\nCrss/C0043Cgd\nCoss/C0043Cds/C0041Cgd\nTherefore, the input capacitance of a MOSFET operating\nin ZVS mode is given by the parallel combination of the gateto source and gate to drain capacitances (i.e. C\niss capacitance\nfor given gate to source voltage). The total gate charge ,\nQg_total , of most MOSFETs on the market is defined for hard\nswitching conditions. In order to accurately calculate the\ndriving losses in a SR system, it is necessary to determine the\ngate charge of the MOSFET for operation specifically in aZVS system. Some manufacturers define this parameter as\nQ\ng_ZVS . Unfortunately , most datasheets do not provide this\ndata. If the C iss (or Q g_ZVS ) parameter is not available thenit will need to be measured . Please note that the input\ncapacitance is not linear (as shown Figure 84) and it needsto be characterized for a given gate voltage clamp level.\nStep 2 − Gate Drive Losses Calculation:\nGate drive losses are affected by the gate driver clamp\nvoltage. Gate driver clamp voltage selection depends on the\ntype of MOSFET used (threshold voltage versus channelresistance). The total power losses (driving loses and\nconduction losses) should be considered when selecting the\ngate driver clamp voltage. Most of today’s MOSFETs for SR\nsystems feature low R\nDS(on)  for 5 V V GS voltage. The\nNCP4305 offers both a 5 V gate clamp and a 10 V gateclamp for those MOSFET that require higher gate to source\nvoltage .\nThe total driving loss can be calculated using the selected\ngate driver clamp voltage and the input capacitance of the\nMOSFET:\nPDRV_total/C0043VCC/C0064VCLAMP/C0064Cg_ZVS/C0064fSW(eq. 9)\nWhere:\nVCC is the NCP4305 supply voltage\nVCLAMP  is the driver clamp voltage\nCg_ZVS  is the gate to source capacitance of the \nMOSFET in ZVS mode\nfsw is the switching frequency of the target \napplication\nThe total driving power loss won’t only be dissipated in\nthe IC , but also in external resistances like the external gate\nresistor (if used) and the MOSFET internal gate resistance\n(Figure 50). Because NCP4305 features a clamped driver,\nit’s high side portion can be modeled as a regular driverswitch with equivalent resistance and a series voltagesource. The low side driver switch resistance does not drop\nimmediately at turn−off, thus it is necessary to use anequivalent value (R\nDRV_SIN_EQ ) for calculations. This\nmethod simplifies power losses calculations and stillprovides acceptable accuracy. Internal driver power\ndissipation can then be calculated using Equation 10:\nNCP4305\nwww. onsemi.com\n48Figure 85.

This power loss is given by theI\nCC current and the IC supply voltage. The I CC current\ndepends on switching frequency and also on the selected min\ntON and t OFF periods because there is current flowing out\nfrom the min t ON and t OFF pins. The most accurate method\nfor calculating these losses is to measure the I CC current\nwhen C DRV = 0 nF and the IC is switching at the target\nfrequency with given MIN_TON and MIN_TOFF adjustresistors. IC consumption losses can be calculated as:\nPCC/C0043VCC/C0064ICC(eq. 11)Step 4 − IC Die Temperature Arise Calculation:\nThe die temperature can be calculated now that the total\ninternal power losses have been determined (driver lossesplus internal IC consumption losses).
