In contrast to the \nDS9502, the DS9503 includes two 5 \uf057\uf020isolation resistors on chip. Although 5 \uf057\uf020are negligible during \ncommunication, they represent a high impedance relati ve to the conducting diode during an ESD event. \nThus, the diode absorbs the energy while the resistors further isolate and protect the circuit at the other \nside of the package. If used with circuits that already have a strong ESD–protection at th eir I/O port, the \nESD protection level is raised to more that 27 kV  (IEC 801–2 Reference model).  In case of abnormal \nESD hits beyond its maximum ratings the DS9503 will eventually fail “short” thus preventing further damage.   During normal operation the DS9503 behaves like a re gular Zener Diode. When the voltage exceeds the \ntrigger voltage, the I/V characteristic of the devi ce will “snapback” allowing the same or higher amount \nof current to flow, but at a sign ificantly lower voltage. As long as a minimum current or voltage is \nmaintained, the device will stay in the “snapback mod e”. If the voltage or the current falls below the \nholding voltage or holding current, the device will abru ptly change to its normal mode and conduct only a \nsmall leakage current. \nDS9503 \nDC CHARACTERISTICS Figure 1 \nVCA/V IC/A \n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 1.0 \n0.8 \n0.6 0.4 \n0.2 I-TRIGGER \nV-TRIGGER VAV SEE DETAIL DRAWING \n \n \nDC CHARACTERISTICS DETAIL DRAWING Figure 2 \n \n \nTEST PULSE WAVEFORM Figure 3 \n \n \nTYPICAL APPLICATION Figure 4  \n \n \n 2 of 4   \nDS9503 \n 3 of 4   ABSOLUTE MAXI MUM RATINGS* \nOperating Temperature     –40°C to +85°C \nStorage Temperature      –55°C to +125°C Soldering Temperature     260°C for 10 seconds Continuous DC Current Through Package   80 mA \n \n\uf02a This is a stress rating only and functional operati on of the device at these or any other conditions \nabove those indicated in the opera tion sections of this specifica tion is not implied.

#### Description:
The **DS9503** is an ESD protection diode specifically designed for 1-Wire MicroLAN interfaces. It features integrated 5 Ω isolation resistors that provide additional protection during ESD events. The device operates like a standard Zener diode under normal conditions, but when the voltage exceeds a certain threshold, it enters a "snapback" mode, allowing for higher current flow at a significantly reduced voltage. This characteristic helps to protect sensitive circuits from high-voltage ESD events, ensuring that the device fails in a safe manner (shorting) to prevent further damage.

#### Typical Applications:
The DS9503 is primarily used in applications requiring robust ESD protection, particularly in:
- **1-Wire MicroLAN interfaces**: Common in communication protocols for sensors and other devices.
- **Consumer electronics**: Protecting I/O ports from ESD damage.
- **Industrial equipment**: Ensuring reliability in environments prone to electrical noise and surges.
- **Telecommunications**: Safeguarding data lines and interfaces from transient voltage spikes.

This component is ideal for any application where ESD protection is critical, especially in environments with high exposure to electrical surges.
