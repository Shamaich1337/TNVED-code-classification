As \na general guideline, Cree Venture recommends that users follow the recommended soldering profile provided by the manufacturer of the \nsolder paste used, and therefore it is the lamp or luminaire manufacturer’s responsibility to determine applicable soldering requirements.\nNote that this general guideline may not apply to all PCB designs and configurations of reflow soldering equipment.\nProfile Feature Lead-Free Solder\nTemperature Min.

These measurements will change over time based on a number \nof factors that are not within Cree Venture’s control and are not intended or provided as operational specifications for the products. \nCalculated values are provided for informational purposes only and are not intended or provided as specifications.\nPre-Release Qualification Testing\nPlease read the J Series Reliability Overview  for the details of the pre‑release qualification testing for J Series LEDs.\nLumen Maintenance\nCree Venture uses standardized IES LM‑80‑08 and TM‑21‑11 methods for collecting long‑term data and extrapolating LED lumen \nmaintenance. For information on the specific LM‑80 data sets available for this LED, refer to the public J Series L M‑80 results document .\nPlease read the Thermal Management application note  for details  on how thermal design, ambient temperature, and drive current affect \nthe LED junction temperature.\nMoisture Sensitivity\nCree Venture recommends keeping J\xa0Series 2835 LEDs in the provided, resealable moisture‑barrier packaging (MBP) until immediately \nprior to soldering. Unopened MBP that contains J\xa0Series 2835 LEDs does not need special storage for moisture sensitivity.\nOnce the MBP is opened, J\xa0Series 2835 LEDs should be handled and stored \nas MSL 3 per JEDEC J‑STD‑033, meaning they have limited exposure time \nbefore damage to the LED may occur during the soldering operation. The \ntable on the right specifies the maximum exposure time in days depending \non temperature and humidity conditions. LEDs with exposure time longer \nthan the specified maximums must be baked according to the baking \nconditions listed below.Moisture \nSensitivity \nLevelTemp.Maximum Percent Relative Humidity\n50% 60% 70% 80% 90%\nLevel 3 35 ºC 8 5 1 0.5 0.5\nLevel 3 30 ºC 11 7 1 1 1\nLevel 3 25 ºC 14 10 2 1 1\nLevel 3 20 ºC 20 13 2 1 1\nBaking Conditions\nIt is not necessary to bake all J\xa0Series 2835 LEDs. Only the LEDs that meet all of the following criteria must be baked:\n1. LEDs that have been removed from the original MBP .\n2. LEDs that have been exposed to a humid environment longer than listed in the Moisture Sensitivity section above.\n3. LEDs that have not been soldered.\nLEDs should be baked at 60\xa0ºC for 24 hours. LEDs may be baked in the original reels. Remove LEDs from the MBP before baking. Do \nnot bake parts at temperatures higher than 60\xa0ºC. This baking operation resets the exposure time as defined in the Moisture Sensitivity \nsection above.\n\nCopyright © 2017-2020 Cree, Inc. All rights reserved.
