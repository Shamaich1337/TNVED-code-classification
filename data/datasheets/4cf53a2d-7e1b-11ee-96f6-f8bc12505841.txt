Functional Description\n4.1  USB Function Controller and Transceiver\nThe Universal Serial Bus function controller in the CP2102N  is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with integrated transceiver and\non-chip matching and pull-up resistors. The USB function controller manages all data transfers between the USB and the UART as well\nas command requests generated by the USB host controller and commands for controlling the function of the UART.\nThe USB Suspend and Resume signals are supported for power management of both the CP2102N device as well as external circuitry.\nThe CP2102N  will enter Suspend mode when Suspend signaling is detected on the bus. On entering Suspend mode, the CP2102N\nasserts the SUSPEND and SUSPENDb signals. SUSPEND and SUSPENDb are also asserted after a CP2102N reset until device con-\nfiguration during USB Enumeration is complete.\nThe CP2102N exits Suspend mode when any of the following occur:\n1. Resume signaling is detected or generated.\n2. A USB Reset signal is detected.\n3. A device reset occurs.\n4. USB Remote Wakeup functionality is enabled and the WAKEUP pin is grounded.\nOn exit of Suspend mode, the SUSPEND and SUSPENDb signals are de-asserted. Both SUSPEND and SUSPENDb temporarily float\nhigh during a CP2102N  reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pull-down (10 k Ω) can be used to ensure SUSPENDb remains\nlow during reset.\n4.2  Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) Interface\nThe CP2102N  UART interface consists of the TX (transmit) and RX (receive) data signals as well as the RTS, CTS, DSR, DTR, DCD,\nand RI control signals. The UART supports RTS/CTS, DSR/DTR, and Xon/Xoff handshaking.\nThe UART is programmable to support a variety of data formats and baud rates. If the Virtual COM Port drivers are used, the data\nformat and baud rate are set during COM port configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers are used, the CP2102N  is configured\nthrough the USBXpress API. The data formats and baud rates available are listed in the table below.\nTable 4.1.

Rev. 1.5  |  17\n4.2.1  Baud Rate Generation\nThe baud rate generator is very flexible, allowing the user to request any baud rate in the range from 300 baud to 3 Mbaud. If the baud\nrate cannot be directly generated from the 48 MHz oscillator, the device will choose the closest possible option. The actual baud rate is\ndictated by the following equations.\nClock Divider =48 MHz\n2×Prescale ×Requested Baud Rate\nActual Baud Rate =48 MHz\n2×Prescale ×Clock Divider\nIn both cases, the Prescale value is 4 if the Requested Baud Rate is ≤ 365 baud and 1 if the Requested Baud Rate value is > 365\nbaud.\nMost baud rates can be generated with an error of less than 1.0%. A general rule of thumb for the majority of UART applications is to\nlimit the baud rate error on both the transmitter and the receiver to no more than ±2%. The Clock Divider value is rounded to the near-\nest integer, which may produce an error source. Another error source will be the 48 MHz oscillator, which is accurate to ±0.25%. Know-\ning the actual and requested baud rates, the total baud rate error can be found using the equation below.\nBaud Rate Error (%) =100×(1–Actual Baud Rate\nRequested Baud Rate )±0.25%\n4.2.2  Sending Break Signaling\nThe CP2102N supports break signaling with an external 10k Ohm resistor between TXD and ground. This resistor is sufficient for break\nsignaling across all baud rates.\nWhen a Send Break command is received, the CP2102N halts adding new data to the transmitter FIFO and will wait 6 byte times for in-\nflight data to complete transmission. It will not process other USB transactions such as RX data reception or GPIO commands while\nwaiting - transactions will be processed once break is initiated. During this time, if enabled, the RS-485 signal will begin asserting. If\nRTS TX Control is enabled, RTS will also begin asserting. Once the 6 byte time has expired, the CP2102N  places the TXD line in a\nhigh-impedance state - ignoring flow control status - and the external resistor pulls down TXD to initiate a break.\nWhile sending break the TXT LED toggle is active. USB transactions including RX data reception and GPIO commands function nor-\nmally.\nWhen a Stop Break command is received, the CP2102N removes TXD from the high impedance state. It is held for 1 byte time to allow\nfor stabilization. After that time has expired the transmitter resumes normal operations, and the RS485 and RTS (if RTS TX Control is\nenabled) signals wait the specified hold time.CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  18\n4.3  Additional Features\n4.3.1  General Purpose Input/Outputs (GPIO)\nThe CP2102N has up to 7 GPIO that can be controlled from the host. By default and during reset, these pins are set to open-drain with\na weak pull-up enabled and the port latch set to 1. The pins can be made push-pull to drive external circuitry like LEDs. In addition, the\nstate of these pins can be configured during standard operation, during Suspend, and immediately following reset.\nNote: All pins temporarily float high during a device reset. If this behavior is undesirable, a strong pull-down (10 k Ω) can be used to\nensure the pin remains low during reset.\n \nThe GPIO pins may also have alternate functions which are listed in the table below.\nTable 4.2.  GPIO Pin Alternate Functions\nGPIO Pin QFN28 Package QFN24 Package QFN20 Package\nGPIO.0 TXT TXT CLK1\nGPIO.1 RXT RXT RS485\nGPIO.2 RS485 RS485 TXT\nGPIO.3 WAKEUP WAKEUP RXT\nGPIO.4 No alternate function Not available Not available\nGPIO.5 No alternate function Not available Not available\nGPIO.6 No alternate function Not available Not available\nNote:\n1. On QFN28 and QFN24 packages, the CLK signal is available on the same pin as RI.\n \nBy default, all of the GPIO pins are configured as a GPIO input. The speed of reading and writing the GPIO pins is subject to the timing\nof the USB bus. GPIO pins configured as inputs or outputs are not recommended for real-time signaling.\nMore information regarding the configuration of these pins can be found in Xpress Configurator in Simplicity Studio and AN721: CP21xx\nDevice Customization Guide . Guidance on GPIO usage can be found in AN223: Runtime GPIO Control for CP210x .\n4.3.2  Dynamic Suspend\nBy default, the latch values for all pins remains static during USB Suspend.\nAlternatively, the dynamic suspend feature sets the pin latch to a predefined state when the CP2102N  device moves from the config-\nured USB state to the suspend USB state (see chapter nine of USB 2.0 specification for more information on USB device states). When\nthe device exits the suspend USB state, the pin latch is restored to the previous value before entering the suspend state. Dynamic\nSuspend is configured separately for the GPIO pins and UART/Modem Control pins.\n4.3.3  Output Mode\nEach pin has two options for the output mode: push-pull and open-drain.\nBy configuring for push-pull operation, a pin operates as a push-pull output. The output voltage is determined by pin’s latch value. This\ntype of output is most often used to connect directly to another device or drive external circuitry like an LED.\nBy configuring for open-drain operation, a pin operates as an open-drain output or input. The output voltage is determined by the pin\'s\nlatch value. If the pin latch value is 1, the pin is pulled up to VIO (or VDD if the device does not have a VIO pin) through an on-chip pull-\nup resistor. Open-drain outputs are typically used when interfacing to logic at a higher voltage than the VIO pin. These pins can be\nsafely pulled to the higher, external voltage through an external pull-up resistor if VDD meets the 3.3 Absolute Maximum Ratings  re-\nquirements.CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  19\n4.3.4  Battery Charging (CHREN, CHR0, and CHR1)\nWhen battery charging is enabled, the D+/D- signals will detect the type of current source attached and set the CHREN, CHR0, and\nCHR1 pins appropriately. CHREN enables 100 mA source current, CHR0 enables 500 mA source current, and CHR1 enables 1.5 A\nsource current.\nThe charging system may draw up to the limit specified by CHREN, CHR0, and CHR1. If the system also is operational while charging,\nthe current set points for the ISET resistors should be decreased based on how much the system could be using during battery charge.\nWhen configuring a device to enable battery charging, the GPIO associated with the battery charging pins must also be configured cor-\nrectly in Xpress Configurator as shown in the following table.\nTable 4.3.  Configuring GPIO for Battery Charging\nCharge Detect Mode Pins State\nUp to 100 mA CHREN Push-Pull/High\nCHR1 Open Drain/Low\nCHR0 Open Drain/Low\nUp to 500 mA CHREN Push-Pull/High\nCHR1 Open Drain/Low\nCHR0 Push-Pull/High\nAbove 500 mA CHREN Push-Pull/High\nCHR1 Push-Pull/High\nCHR0 Push-Pull/High\nNote: Battery charging pins (CHREN, CHR1, CHR0) are disabled in Suspend only when using a Standard Data Port. If attached to a\nDedicated Charging Port or Charging Downstream Port, the battery charging pins are left on while in Suspend.\n \n4.3.5  Remote Wakeup (WAKEUP)\nThe WAKEUP pin is an optional active low remote wakeup input. When the wakeup pin toggles from inactive to active (i.e. grounded)\nand the CP2102N is in USB suspend, the CP2102N will begin the wakeup sequence.\nHost software must enable USB remote wakeup for the device. In Windows, this is under Device Manager. To set this, right-click on the\ndevice, select [ Properties ]>[Power Management ] and enable the [ Allow this device to wake the computer ] feature.\n4.3.6  Clock Output (CLK)\nAn optional clock output is available on CP2102N devices.\nFCLK=48 MHz\n2×N\nThe valid values for N are 1 to 256.\nNote: The clock output stops and is no longer present on the pin when the CP2102N device is in USB Suspend. This occurs when the\ndevice is connected to USB and the host controller suspends the device (either through a feature like Selective Suspend or when the\nhost PC is in Hibernate or Sleep modes) or when the CP2102N is disconnected from the host in self-powered mode.\n CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  20\n4.3.7  Hardware Handshaking (RTS and CTS)\nTo utilize the functionality of the RTS and CTS pins of the CP2102N , the device must be configured to use hardware flow control on the\nUSB host.\nRTS, or Ready To Send, is an active-low output from the CP2102N  and indicates to the external UART device that the CP2102N’s\nUART RX FIFO has not reached the FLOW OFF watermark level of 448 bytes and is ready to accept more data. When the amount of\ndata in the RX FIFO reaches the watermark, the CP2102N pulls RTS high to indicate to the external UART device to stop sending data.\nThe CP2102N does not pull RTS low again until the UART RX FIFO is at the FLOW ON watermark level of 384 bytes (at least 128 free\nbytes). This hysteresis allows for optimal operation. These RTS watermark levels are configurable using Xpress Configurator in Simplic-\nity Studio.\nNote: RTS TX Control signaling is a special mode that asserts RTS while the CP2102N  is transmitting. This mode is not available be-\nlow 300 baud. RTS hardware flow control works at all baud rates.\n \nCTS, or Clear To Send, is an active-low input to the CP2102N  and is used by the external UART device to indicate to the CP2102N\nwhen the external UART device’s RX FIFO is getting full. The CP2102N  will not send more than two bytes of data once CTS is pulled\nhigh.\nHardware handshaking allows for optimal continuous transmission speeds at high baud rates (greater than 1 MBaud). The effective\nthroughput depends on USB bus loading and host USB stack efficiency. The typical maximum continuous bidirectional data transfer is\n> 450 kbytes/s at 3 Mbaud.\nRS232\nSystemCP2102N\nTX\nRXTX\nRX\nRTS\nCTSRTS\nCTS\nFigure 4.1.  Using Hardware Flow Control with the CP2102NCP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  21\n4.3.8  Software Handshaking\nThe CP2102N also supports software handshaking using the XON and XOFF event characters. The characters used for XON/XOFF is\nset by the host software.\nIf the CP2102N  receives an XOFF request, it will stop transmission, even if the CP2102N  receiver needs to transmit an XOFF over\nUART. This can potentially allow an overflow to occur or a deadlock condition if both the CP2102N  and the connected UART device\ntransmit XOFF at the same time. The XOFF_CONTINUE setting allows the CP2102N transmitter to send XOFF/XON requests even if it\nhas received an XOFF request from the connected UART device. Once the connected UART device transmits XON, normal transmis-\nsion from the CP2102N resumes.\nSoftware handshaking uses the same watermark levels as hardware handshaking and can be configured dynamically by host software.\nWatermark levels greater than 512 are converted to an XON limit of 192 bytes and an XOFF limit of 64 bytes. If the XON limit crosses\nover the XOFF limit, the XON limit will automatically be modified to not cross over the XOFF limit. An XOFF limit of 0 is converted to 64\nto guarantee buffer space is available until the UART end device stops transmission. When setting the XON and XOFF limits, it\'s rec-\nommended to use values where the XON limit added to the XOFF limit is less than 512 bytes, like 192/192 or 128/128. CP2102N\ntesting shows that the XON limit set to 192 and XOFF limit set to 192 provides optimal software flow control behavior.\n0xF0RS232\nSystemCP2102N\nTX RX 0x40 0x23 0x51 0x64 0x87CP2102N \nreceives XON  CP2102N \nreceives XOFF  \nFigure 4.2.  Software Flow Control Timing Diagram\n4.3.9  Data Throughput Optimization\nEffective throughput depends on several factors:\n• CP2102N placement on the physical USB device tree\n• USB bus load from other devices\n• Host OS USB stack efficiency\n• CP2102N configuration options\nHandshaking is required at high baud rates (greater than 1 MBaud) to avoid receiver overrun. A request to stop transmission is only\ninitiated once the RX FIFO has reached the FLOW OFF watermark level. Once the USB bus lowers the RX FIFO level below the FLOW\nON watermark, a request to continue transmission is sent.\nHardware handshaking allows for optimal continuous transmission speeds at high baud rates. Using a Windows host PC, the\nCP2102N\'s typical maximum continuous bidirectional throughput is > 450 kbytes/s at 3 Mbaud (> 70% efficiency).\nSoftware handshaking using XON/XOFF transmission requires more overhead. Using a Windows host PC, the CP2102N\'s typical maxi-\nmum continuous bidirectional throughput is > 330 kbytes/s at 3 Mbaud (> 55% efficiency).\nFor these performance numbers, the CP2102N  is placed on a USB hub connected to the Windows host PC with a third party UART\nadapter. The only significant USB traffic is generated by the USB to UART devices. The Windows host PC is running automated tests\nwith minimal CPU load.\nCertain conditions will reduce the maximum throughput at high baud rates (> 1Mbaud):\n• Using DSR, DTR, or DCD handshaking signals lowers maximum performance. Use hardware CTS/RTS only for peak performance.\n•Embedded events or error character insertion requires free space in the UART RX FIFO to post events to the host. At high baud\nrates with continuous data reception, this space may not be available. Limit maximum baud rates with continuous data reception to 1\nMBaud when using embedded events or error character insertion to guarantee reception of events or the error character.\n•Transmitting an immediate character momentarily causes lower bidirectional throughput as the character forces a bypass of the cur-\nrent transmit FIFO. Once the character has been transmitted, the typical bidirectional throughput is restored.\nUsing Remote Wakeup, Charge Enable, Clock Out, or the GPIOs will not impact UART throughput.CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  22\n4.3.10  Transmit and Receive LED Toggles (TXT and RXT)\nThe TX and RX LED toggle pins will toggle on and off at a fixed rate specified in Table 3.7 GPIO on page 13 whenever a byte is trans-\nmitted or received by the CP2102N . These pins are logic high whenever a device is not transmitting or receiving data and can directly\ndrive basic LEDs within the device specification limits.\nCP2102N\nTXT\nRXTVIO\nFigure 4.3.

If the Virtual COM Port drivers are used, the modem control pins are\nenabled during COM port configuration on the PC. If the USBXpress drivers are used, the CP2102N  is configured through the USBX-\npress API. The behavior of the modem control pins may vary between operating systems.\nTable 4.4.

When configured for RS485\nmode, the pin is asserted during UART data transmission. The RS485 pin is active-high by default and is also configurable for active-\nlow mode using Xpress Configurator.\nThe RS485 pin setup and hold times are programmable using Xpress Configurator to enable maximum flexibility.\nNote: Note The RS485 pin is not available at baud rates below 300 baud.\n \nRS485\nTransceiverCP2102N\nR\nD\nDERETX\nRX\nRS485\nFigure 4.4.

RS485 Output Timing Diagram for a Single-Byte Transfer\n4.3.13  Receiver Timeout\nThe CP2102N supports a new custom vendor command to configure the internal buffer receive timeout. During normal operation, when\ndata is received the receive buffer waits up to 2 ms or 128 character times, whichever is fewer, before transferring data to host. This\ntimer is reset each time new data is received. For some usage models, this response time causes unwanted extra latency between\nreceiving a byte at the UART and the byte being available on the host. The Set Receiver Max Timeout custom vendor command allows\napplications to set the timeout from .001 ms to 2 ms. Small values will cause the receiver to inefficiently use the 512 byte Receive\nBuffer and should not be used at high data rates (greater than 230400).\n4.4  Drivers\nThere are two sets of device drivers available for the CP2102N devices: the Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers and the USBXpress Direct\nAccess drivers. Only one set of drivers is necessary to interface with the device.\nThe latest drivers are available at www.silabs.com/interface-software .CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  24\n4.4.1  Virtual COM Port (VCP) Drivers\nThe CP2102N  Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2102N -based USB device to appear to the PC\'s application software\nas a COM port. Application software running on the PC accesses the CP2102N -based device as it would access a standard hardware\nCOM port. However, actual data transfer between the PC and the CP2102N  device is performed over the USB interface. Therefore,\nexisting COM port applications may be used to transfer data via the USB to the CP2102N -based device without modifying the applica-\ntion. See AN197: Serial Communications Guide for the CP210x  for Example Code for Interfacing to a CP2102N  using the Virtual COM\ndrivers.\nNote: Because the CP2102N  uses a USB-based communication interface, timing will not be controllable or guaranteed as it is with a\nstandard COM port. Full-speed USB operates on 1 ms frames, and the host schedules packets for each USB device where it can in the\n1 ms frame. It is recommended to use large data transfers when reading and writing from the host to send data as quickly as possible.\n \n4.4.2  USBXpress Drivers\nThe Silicon Labs USBXpress drivers provide an alternate solution for interfacing with CP2102N  devices. No serial port protocol exper-\ntise is required. Instead, a simple, high-level application program interface (API) is used to provide simpler CP210x connectivity and\nfunctionality. The USBXpress for CP210x Development Kit includes Windows device drivers, Windows device driver installer and unin-\nstallers, and a host interface function library (host API) provided in the form of a Windows Dynamic Link Library (DLL). The USBXpress\ndriver set is recommended for new products that also include new PC software. The USBXpress interface is described in AN169:\nUSBXpress® Programmer\'s Guide .\n4.4.3  Customization and Certification\nIn addition to customizing the device as described in 4.5 Device Customization , the drivers can be also be customized. See AN220:\nUSB Driver Customization  for more information on generating customized VCP and USBXpress drivers.\nThe default drivers that are shipped with the CP2102N  are Microsoft WHQL (Windows Hardware Quality Labs) certified. The certifica-\ntion means that the drivers have been tested by Microsoft and their latest operating systems will allow the drivers to be installed without\nany warnings or errors. Some installations of Windows will prevent unsigned drivers from being installed at all. The customized drivers\nthat are generated using the AN220  software are not automatically certified. They must first go through the Microsoft Driver Reseller\nSubmission process. See AN807: Recertifying a Customized Windows HCK Driver Package  for more information and contact Silicon\nLabs support for assistance with this process.CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world. Rev. 1.5  |  25\n4.5  Device Customization\nThe CP2102N  includes an internal electrically erasable programmable read-only memory (EEPROM). This memory may be used to\ncustomize the USB Vendor ID (VID), Product ID (PID), Product Description String, Power Descriptor, Device Release Number and De-\nvice Serial Number as desired for OEM applications. If the EEPROM is not programmed with OEM data, the default configuration data\nshown in the table below is used.\nTable 4.5.  Default USB Configuration Data\nName Description Default Value\nVendor ID (VID) The Vendor ID is a four digit hexadecimal number that is\nunique to a particular vendor. 0x10C4, for example, is the\nSilicon Labs Vendor ID.0x10C4\nProduct ID (PID) The Product ID is a four digit hexadecimal number that\nidentifies the vendor\'s device. 0xEA60, for example, is the\ndefault Product ID for Silicon Labs\' CP210x USB to UART\nBridge devices.0xEA60\nPower Mode This setting determines whether the device is Bus-Pow-\nered, i.e. it is powered by the host, or Self-Powered, i.e. it\nis powered from a supply on the device.0x80 (Bus-Powered)\nMax Power This describes the maximum amount of power that the de-\nvice will draw from the host in mA multiplied by 2. For ex-\nample, 0x32 equates to 100 mA.0x32\nRelease Version The Release Version is a binary-coded-decimal value that\nis assigned by the device manufacturer.0x0100\nSerial String The Serial String is an optional string that is used by the\nhost to distinguish between multiple devices with the same\nVID and PID combination. It is limited to 63 characters.128-bit unique ID assigned by Silicon Labs\nProduct String The Product String is an optional string that describes the\nproduct. It is limited to 126 characters."CP2102N USB to UART Bridge Controller"\nWhile customization of the USB configuration data is optional, it is recommended to customize the VID/PID combination. A unique\nVID/PID combination will prevent the driver from conflicting with any other USB driver. A vendor ID can be obtained from http://\nwww.usb.org/  or Silicon Labs can provide a free PID for the OEM product that can be used with the Silicon Laboratories VID ( http://\nwww.silabs.com/products/mcu/Pages/request-PID.aspx ).\nIf the OEM application supports multiple CP2102N -based devices attached to the same PC, each CP2102N  must have a unique serial\nnumber. By default, the CP2102N uses a unique 128 bit identifier as the serial number. Alternatively, sequential serial numbers can be\npre-programmed by Silicon Labs using settings provided by Xpress Configurator and delivered as a custom CP2102N  part number.\nThese serial numbers can be unique per custom part number, or multiple part numbers can share the same group of sequential serial\nnumbers. For more details, see Xpress Configurator in Simplicity Studio.\nThe internal programmable ROM is programmed via the USB. This allows the OEM\'s USB configuration data and serial number to be\nwritten to the CP2102N on-board ROM during the manufacturing and testing process. A simple GUI-based or command-line customiza-\ntion utility for programming the internal programmable ROM is available from Silicon Labs as a part of Simplicity Studio or available\nseparately on the Silicon Labs website ( www.silabs.com/interface-software ).\nThe device parameters can be locked to prevent future modification on the CP2102N.CP2102N Data Sheet\nFunctional Description\nsilabs.com  | Building a more connected world.
