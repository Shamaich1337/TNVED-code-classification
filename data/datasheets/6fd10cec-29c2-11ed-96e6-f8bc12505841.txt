The low ON-state resistance (R on) of the switch allows connections\nto be made with minimal propagation delay. When EN is HIGH, the translator switch is\non, and the SCL1 and SDA1 I/O are connected to the SCL2 and SDA2 I/O, respectively,\nallowing bidirectional data flow between ports. When EN is LOW, the translator switch is\noff, and a high-impedance state exists between ports.\nThe PCA9306 is not a bus buffer like the PCA9509 or PCA9517A that provide both level\ntranslation and physically isolate the capacitance to either side of the bus when both\nsides are connected. The PCA9306 only isolates both sides when the device is disabled\nand provides voltage level translation when active.\nThe PCA9306 can also be used to run two buses, one at 400 kHz operating frequency\nand the other at 100 kHz operating frequency. If the two buses are operating at different\nfrequencies, the 100 kHz bus must be isolated when the 400 kHz operation of the other\nbus is required. If the controller is running at 400 kHz, the maximum system operating\nfrequency may be less than 400 kHz because of the delays added by the translator.\nAs with the standard I2C-bus system, pull-up resistors are required to provide the\nlogic HIGH levels on the translator’s bus. The PCA9306 has a standard open-collector\nconfiguration of the I2C-bus. The size of these pull-up resistors depends on the system,\nbut each side of the translator must have a pull-up resistor. The device is designed to\nwork with Standard-mode, Fast-mode and Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus devices in addition\nto SMBus devices. The maximum frequency is dependent on the RC time constant, but\ngenerally supports > 2 MHz.\nWhen the SDA1 or SDA2 port is LOW, the clamp is in the ON-state and a low resistance\nconnection exists between the SDA1 and SDA2 ports. Assuming the higher voltage is on\nthe SDA2 port when the SDA2 port is HIGH, the voltage on the SDA1 port is limited to\nthe voltage set by VREF1. When the SDA1 port is HIGH, the SDA2 port is pulled to the\ndrain pull-up supply voltage (V pu(D)) by the pull-up resistors. This functionality allows a\nseamless translation between higher and lower voltages selected by the user without the\nneed for directional control. The SCL1/SCL2 channel also functions as the SDA1/SDA2\nchannel.\nAll channels have the same electrical characteristics and there is minimal deviation from\none output to another in voltage or propagation delay. This is a benefit over discrete\ntransistor voltage translation solutions, since the fabrication of the switch is symmetrical.\nThe translator provides excellent ESD protection to lower voltage devices, and at the\nsame time protects less ESD-resistant devices.\nNXP SemiconductorsPCA9306\nDual bidirectional I2C-bus and SMBus voltage-level translator\n2Features and benefits\n•2-bit bidirectional translator for SDA and SCL lines in mixed-mode I2C-bus applications\n•Standard-mode, Fast-mode, and Fast-mode Plus I2C-bus and SMBus compatible\n•Less than 1.5 ns maximum propagation delay to accommodate Standard-mode and\nFast-mode I2C-bus devices and multiple controllers\n•Allows voltage level translation between:\n–1.0 V V ref(1)  and 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V Vbias(ref)(2)\n–1.2 V V ref(1)  and 1.8 V, 2.5 V, 3.3 V or 5 V Vbias(ref)(2)\n–1.8 V V ref(1) and 3.3 V or 5 V V bias(ref)(2)\n–2.5 V V ref(1) and 5 V V bias(ref)(2)\n–3.3 V V ref(1) and 5 V V bias(ref)(2)\n•Provides bidirectional voltage translation with no direction pin\n•Low 3.5 Ω ON-state connection between input and output ports provides less signal\ndistortion\n•Open-drain I2C-bus I/O ports (SCL1, SDA1, SCL2 and SDA2)\n•5 V tolerant I2C-bus I/O ports to support mixed-mode signal operation\n•High-impedance SCL1, SDA1, SCL2 and SDA2 pins for EN = LOW\n•Lock-up free operation\n•Flow through pinout for ease of printed-circuit board trace routing\n•ESD protection exceeds 2000 V HBM per JESD22-A114 and 1000 V CDM per\nJESD22-C101\n•Packages offered: SO8, TSSOP8, VSSOP8, XQFN8, XSON8\n3Ordering information\nPackage Type number Topside\nmarkName Description Version\nPCA9306D PCA9306 SO8 plastic small outline package; 8 leads; body width 3.9\nmmSOT96-1\nPCA9306DC1[1]P06 VSSOP8 plastic very thin shrink small outline package; 8 leads;\nbody width 2.3 mmSOT765-1\nPCA9306DC1/\nDG[2]P06 VSSOP8 plastic very thin shrink small outline package; 8 leads;\nbody width 2.3 mmSOT765-1\nPCA9306DP 306P TSSOP8[3]plastic thin shrink small outline package; 8 leads;\nbody width 3 mmSOT505-1\nPCA9306DP1[4]306T TSSOP8 plastic thin shrink small outline package; 8 leads;\nbody width 3 mm; lead length 0.5 mmSOT505-2\nPCA9306GF[5]06 XSON8 extremely thin small outline package; no leads; 8\nterminals;\nbody 1.35 x 1 x 0.5 mmSOT1089\nPCA9306GM P6X[6]XQFN8 plastic extremely thin quad flat package; no leads;\n8 terminals; body 1.6 x 1.6 x 0.5 mmSOT902-2Table 1.\u2007Ordering information\n[1]Same footprint and pinout as the Texas Instruments PA9306DCU.

This allows\nVREF2 to regulate the EN input. A filter capacitor on VREF2 is recommended. The I2C-\nbus controller output can be totem pole or open-drain (pull-up resistors may be required)\nand the I2C-bus device output can be totem pole or open-drain (pull-up resistors are\nrequired to pull the SCL2 and SDA2 outputs to V pu(D) ). However, if either output is totem\npole, data must be unidirectional or the outputs must be 3-stateable and be controlled\nby some direction-control mechanism to prevent HIGH-to-LOW contentions in either\ndirection. If both outputs are open-drain, no direction control is needed.\nThe reference supply voltage (V ref(1)) is connected to the processor core power supply\nvoltage. When VREF2 is connected through a 200 kΩ resistor to a 3.3 V to 5.5 V V pu(D)\npower supply, and Vref(1) is set between 1.0 V and (V pu(D) - 1 V), the output of each SCL1\nand SDA1 has a maximum output voltage equal to VREF1, and the output of each SCL2\nand SDA2 has a maximum output voltage equal to V pu(D).\nRefer to Figure 9 .\nSymbol Parameter Conditions Min Typ[1]Max Unit\nVbias(ref)(2) reference bias voltage (2) Vref(1) + 0.6 2.1 5 V\nVI(EN) input voltage on pin EN Vref(1) + 0.6 2.1 5 V\nVref(1) reference voltage (1) 0 1.5 4.4 V\nIsw(pass) pass switch current - 14 - mA\nIref reference current transistor - 5 - μA\nTamb ambient temperature operating in\nfree-air-40 - +105 °CTable 10.\u2007Application operating conditions\nPCA9306 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2021.

The calculated values assume that both drive currents are the same.

When selecting the minimum resistor\nvalue in Table 11, Table 12 or Table 13, the drive current strength that should be chosen\nshould be the lowest drive current seen in the application and account for any drive\nstrength current scaling with output voltage.

The node capacitance is the addition of the PCB trace capacitance and the\ndevice capacitance that exists on the bus. Because of the dependency of the external\ncomponents, PCB layout and the different device operating states the calculation of rise\nand fall times is complex and has several inflection points along the curve.\nThe main component of the rise and fall times is the RC time constant of the bus line\nwhen the device is in its two primary operating states: when device is in the ON state and\nit is low-impedance, the other is when the device is OFF isolating the A-side from the B-\nside.\nA description of the fall time applied to either An or Bn output going from HIGH to LOW\nis as follows. Whichever side is asserted first, the B-side down must discharge to the\nVCC(A)  voltage. The time is determined by the pull-up resistor, pull-down driver strength\nand the capacitance. As the level moves below the V CC(A)  voltage, the channel resistance\ndrops so that both A and B sides equal. The capacitance on both sides is connected\nto form the total capacitance and the pull-up resistors on both sides combine to the\nparallel equivalent resistance. The R on of the device is small compared to the pull-up\nresistor values, so its effect on the pull-up resistance can be neglected and the fall is\ndetermined by the driver pulling the combined capacitance and pull-up resistor currents.\nAn estimation of the actual fall time seen by the device is equal to the time it takes for\nthe B-side to fall to the V CC(A)  voltage and the time it takes for both sides to fall from the\nVCC(A)  voltage to the V IL level.\nA description of the rise time applied to either An or Bn output going from LOW to HIGH\nis as follows. When the signal level is LOW, the Ron is at its minimum, so the A and B\nsides are essentially one node. They will rise together with an RC time constant that is\nthe sum of all the capacitance from both sides and the parallel of the resistance from\nboth sides. As the signal approaches the V CC(A)  voltage, the channel resistance goes up\nand the waveforms separate, with the B side finishing its rise with the RC time constant\nof the B side. The rise to V CC(A)  is essentially the same for both sides.\nThere are some basic guidelines to follow that will help maximize the performance of the\ndevice:\n•Keep trace length to a minimum by placing the NVT device close to the processor.\n•The signal round trip time on trace should be shorter than the rise or fall time of signal\nto reduce reflections.\n•The faster the edge of the signal, the higher the chance for ringing.\n•The higher drive strength controlled by the pull-up resistor (up to 15 mA), the higher the\nfrequency the device can use.\nThe system designer must design the pull-up resistor value based on external current\ndrive strength and limit the node capacitance (minimize the wire, stub, connector and\ntrace length) to get the desired operation frequency result.\nPCA9306 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2021.

A more in-depth account\nof soldering ICs can be found in Application Note AN10365 “Surface mount reflow\nsoldering description” .\n13.1 Introduction to soldering\nSoldering is one of the most common methods through which packages are attached\nto Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs), to form electrical circuits. The soldered joint provides\nboth the mechanical and the electrical connection. There is no single soldering method\nthat is ideal for all IC packages. Wave soldering is often preferred when through-hole\nand Surface Mount Devices (SMDs) are mixed on one printed wiring board; however, it is\nnot suitable for fine pitch SMDs. Reflow soldering is ideal for the small pitches and high\ndensities that come with increased miniaturization.\n13.2 Wave and reflow soldering\nWave soldering is a joining technology in which the joints are made by solder coming\nfrom a standing wave of liquid solder. The wave soldering process is suitable for the\nfollowing:\n•Through-hole components\n•Leaded or leadless SMDs, which are glued to the surface of the printed circuit board\nNot all SMDs can be wave soldered. Packages with solder balls, and some leadless\npackages which have solder lands underneath the body, cannot be wave soldered. Also,\nleaded SMDs with leads having a pitch smaller than ~0.6 mm cannot be wave soldered,\ndue to an increased probability of bridging.\nThe reflow soldering process involves applying solder paste to a board, followed by\ncomponent placement and exposure to a temperature profile. Leaded packages,\npackages with solder balls, and leadless packages are all reflow solderable.\nKey characteristics in both wave and reflow soldering are:\n•Board specifications, including the board finish, solder masks and vias\n•Package footprints, including solder thieves and orientation\n•The moisture sensitivity level of the packages\n•Package placement\n•Inspection and repair\n•Lead-free soldering versus SnPb soldering\n13.3 Wave soldering\nKey characteristics in wave soldering are:\n•Process issues, such as application of adhesive and flux, clinching of leads, board\ntransport, the solder wave parameters, and the time during which components are\nexposed to the wave\n•Solder bath specifications, including temperature and impurities\n13.4 Reflow soldering\nKey characteristics in reflow soldering are:\nPCA9306 All information provided in this document is subject to legal disclaimers. © NXP B.V. 2021.

It is imperative that the peak\ntemperature is high enough for the solder to make reliable solder joints (a solder\npaste characteristic). In addition, the peak temperature must be low enough that the\npackages and/or boards are not damaged.
