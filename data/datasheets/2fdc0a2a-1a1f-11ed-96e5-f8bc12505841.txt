B. 3 \n SG Micro Corp  \nwww.sg -micro.com  \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION  \nThe SGM2028  is a low-power, low -noise, low -dropout , \nCMOS linear voltage regulator that  operates  from a \n2.5V to 5.5V input  voltage . It is the perfect choice for \nlow voltage, low power applications. A low ground \ncurrent makes this part attractive for battery operated \npower systems. The SGM 2028  also offer s ultra low \ndropout voltage to prolong battery life in portable \nelectronics. Systems requiring a quiet voltage source, \nsuch as RF applications, will benefit from the \nSGM 2028 ’s ultra low output noise (30µV RMS) and high \nPSRR. An external noise bypass capacitor connected \nto the device’s BP pin can further reduce the noise \nlevel.  \nOther features include output current limit  and thermal \nshutdown protection.  \nThe SGM2028 is available in Green SOT-23-5 package. \nIt operates over an ambient temperature range of - 40℃  \nto +85℃.

Besides this, handheld products will be tested on the \nproduction line without battery. Test engineer will apply power from the connector pin which connects with positive \npole of the battery. When external power supply is turned on suddenly, the voltage spikes will be generated at the \nbattery connector. The voltage spikes will be very high, and it always exceeds the absolute maximum input voltage \n(6.0V) of LDO. In order to get robust design, design engineer needs to clear up this voltage spike. Zener diode is a \ncheap and effective solution to eliminate such voltage spike. For example, BZM55B5V6 is a 5.6V small package Zener diode which can be used to remove voltage spikes in cell phone designs.
