Employing the latest in epitaxial construction and advanced processing techniques it features a superb combination of characteristics which result in performance \nwhich is unsurpassed by any rect ifier previously available. \nWith basic ratings of 600 V and 15 A continuous current, the VS-HFA15TB60... is especially well suited for use as the \ncompanion diode for IGBTs and MOSFETs. In addition to ultrafast recovery time, the HEXFRED\n® product line features \nextremely low values of peak recovery current (I RRM) and \ndoes not exhibit any tendency to “snap-off” during the t b\nportion of recovery. The HEXFRE D features combine to offer \ndesigners a rectifier with lowe r noise and significantly lower \nswitching losses in both the diode and the switching transistor. These HEXFRED advantages can help to significantly reduce snu bbing, component count and \nheatsink sizes. The HEXFRED VS-HFA15TB60... is ideally suited for applications in  power supplies and power \nconversion systems (such as in verters), motor drives, and \nmany other similar applicatio ns where high speed, high \nefficiency is needed.PRIMARY CHARACTERISTICS\nIF(AV) 15 A\nVR 600 V\nVF at I F 1.2 V\ntrr typ. 23 ns\nTJ max. 150 °C\nCircuit configuration Single\nPackage 2L TO-220AC\n2L TO-220AC12\n3\nAnode1 3\nCathodeBase\ncathode\n2\nABSOLUTE MAXIMUM RATINGS\nPARAMETER SYMBOL TEST CONDITIONS VALUES UNITSCathode to anode voltage V\nR 600 V\nMaximum continuous  forward current I F TC = 100 °C 15\nA Single pulse forward current I FSM 150\nMaximum repetitive forward current I FRM 60\nMaximum power dissipation P DTC = 25 °C 74WTC = 100 °C 29\nOperating junction and storage temperature range T J, TStg -55 to +150 °C\nVS-HFA15TB60-M3\nwww.vishay.comVishay Semiconductors  \n \nRevision: 23-Nov-17 2 Document Number: 96191\nFor technical questions within your region: DiodesAmericas@vishay.com , DiodesAsia@vishay.com , DiodesEurope@vishay.com\nTHIS DOCUMENT IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE WITHOUT NOTICE.
