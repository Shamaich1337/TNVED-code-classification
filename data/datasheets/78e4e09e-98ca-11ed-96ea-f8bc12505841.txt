By definition, the supply connected to V1  is the higher \npriority supply, although this can be changed dynamically. \nExternal resistive dividers set the undervoltage and over -\nvoltage thresholds that bound the valid voltage window.\nStrong gate drivers switch the large external N-channel \nMOSFETs quickly. Fast switchover circuitry minimizes \noutput droop when changing channels while preventing \nreverse and cross conduction. A fast comparator detects input short circuits and quickly turns off the N-channel MOSFETs to minimize disruption.\nExternal sense resistors set the maximum inrush and cur -\nrent limit currents. During current limiting, the LTC4421 \ncontrols the N-channel MOSFET gate to regulate 25mV \nacross the sense resistor . When the sense resistor voltage \nhas been regulated to 25mV for a user-settable time, the channel is disconnected and a fault is set.

Pin names having suffix \n“1” \napply to Channel 1, while those having suffix “2” apply to Channel 2. When no suffix is used when referencing one of these pins, it means that the text applies to the pins on both channels. For example, “Connect a capacitor C\nTMR from TMR to ground” means “Connect a capacitor \nCTMR1 between the TMR1 pin and ground” and “Connect \na capacitor C TMR2 between the TMR2 pin and ground”. References to multiple pin names with no suffix are meant to describe functionality within a channel but apply to both channels. These references occur for the following cases:\n1. Connecting two pins together : “Tie FAUL T to DISABLE” \nmeans “Tie FAUL T1 to DISABLE1”  and “ Tie FAUL T2 to \nDISABLE2”.\n2. Referring to differential voltages : “SENSE to OUT” \nmeans “SENSE1 to OUT1” and “SENSE2 to OUT2”.\n3. Causation: “ The VALID pins pull low when their V1- V2 \nsupplies have been validated”  means “ The VALID1 pin \npulls low when the V1 supply has been validated”  and \n“The VALID2 pin pulls low when the V2 supply has \nbeen validated”.LTC4421 DATA SHEET NOMENCLATURE\nLTC4421\n6\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nGATE Drive Voltage vs CPOREF \nVoltage INTV CC Voltage vs EXTV CC Voltage SENSE Voltage vs Temperature\nUndervoltage Threshold vs TemperatureOvervoltage Thresholds vs TemperatureTotal Supply Current vs EXTV\nCC \nVoltage\nGATE On Pull-Up Current vs GATE VoltageT\nA = 25°C, EXTV CC = 11V, unless otherwise noted.\nShutdown Current vs EXTV CC \nVoltage (V1 = 12V, V2 = 13V)Supply Current vs EXTV CC Voltage \n(V1 = 12V, V2 = 13V)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nCPOREF VOL TAGE (V)\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\nGATE-CPOREF VOL TAGE (V)\n4421 G01\nTRANSITION TO \nBurst Mode OPERATION\nEXTV CC = 3.0\nEXTV CC ≥ 4.0\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nEXTV CC VOL TAGE (V)\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nVOL TAGE (V)\n4421 G02\nINTV CC, RLOAD  = 10k\nINTV CC, NO LOAD\nEXTV CC\n−50\n−25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n23\n24\n25\n26\n27\nSENSE VOL TAGE (mV)\n4421 G03\n−50\n−25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n0.490\n0.495\n0.500\n0.505\n0.510\nTHRESHOLD VOL TAGE (V)\n4421 G04\n−50\n−25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n0.425\n0.450\n0.475\n0.500\n0.525\nTHRESHOLD VOL TAGE (V)\n4421 G05\nRISING\nFALLING\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nEXTV CC VOL TAGE (V)\n400\n450\n500\n550\n600\n650\n700\nSUPPL Y CURRENT (µA)\n4421 G06\nT = 25°C\nT = 125°C\nT = −40°C\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nGATE-OUT VOL TAGE (V)\n−20\n−15\n−10\n−5\n0\nGATE CURRENT (mA)\n4421 G07\nSENSE = 0mV\nSENSE = 6.25mV\nSENSE = 12.5mV\nSENSE = 18.75mV\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nEXTV CC VOL TAGE (V)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nV1, V2, EXTV CC CURRENT (µA)\n4421 G08\nV1 + V2 + EXTV CC\nEXTV CC\nV1\nV2\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nEXTV\nCC\n VOL TAGE (V)\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nV1, V2, EXTV\nCC CURRENT (µA)\n4421 G09\n(V1=12V , V2=13V)\nV1 + V2 + EXTV\nCC\nEXTV\nCC\nV1\nV2\nLTC4421\n7\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comTYPICAL PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS\nVOUT Switching from Higher to \nLower VoltageVOUT Switching from Lower to \nHigher VoltageOV , UV Validation Time vs QUAL \nCapacitance\nVALID, CH, FAULT Output Low Voltage vs Pull-Up CurrentGATE Break-Before-Make Time vs TemperatureOV , UV Propagation Delay vs Overdrive\nGATE Drive vs GATE CurrentT\nA = 25°C, EXTV CC = 11V, unless otherwise noted.\nGATE Drive vs Temperature\nV\nOUT\nC\nOUT\n = 100µF\nI\nLOAD\n = 5A\n30V NCH SiR158DP\n50µs/DIV\nV\n1\n4V/DIV\nV\n2\n4V/DIV\nI\nV1\n2A/DIV\n4421 G10\n0V , 0A\nV\nOUT\nC\nOUT\n = 100µF\nI\nLOAD\n = 5A\n30V NCH SiR158DP\n50µs/DIV\nV\n1\n5V/DIV\nV\n2\n5V/DIV\nI\nV2\n2A/DIV\n4421 G11\n0A\n0V\nC\nQUAL\n (pF)\n10\n100\n1000\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\nTIME (ms)\n4421 G12\n125°C\n25°C\n–40°C\nEXTV\nCC\n = 3V\nPULL–UP CURRENT (mA)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\nVOL (mV)\n4421 G13\nEXTV\nCC\n = 3.1V\nEXTV\nCC\n = 11V\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n–50\n–25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\nTIME (µs)\n4421 G14\nOVERDRIVE (mV)\n1\n10\n100\n1000\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\nt\nINVALID\n (µs)\n4421 G15\n3V\n3.2V\n5V\n12V\n36V\nI\nGATE\n (µA)\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n8.0\n9.0\n10.0\n11.0\n12.0\nGATE-CPOREF VOL TAGE (V)\n4421 G16\nCPOREF:  \nCPOREF\n = 12V\nI\nGATE\n = 1µA\nCPOREF = 3.2V\nTEMPERATURE (°C)\n–50\n–25\n0\n25\n50\n75\n100\n125\n10.0\n10.4\n10.8\n11.2\n11.6\n12.0\nGATE–CPOREF VOL TAGE (V)\n4421 G17\nLTC4421\n8\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comPIN FUNCTIONS\nCASIN: Digital Input for Cascading.

This is the output of the charge \npump, which is used to provide overdrive to the GATE pins. \nConnect a ceramic capacitor between CPO and CPOREF \nwhose value must be at least 10 times the combined \ncapacitance of the GATE compensation capacitor plus the \ngate capacitance of the back-to-back external N-Channel \nMOSFETs of one channel. When the (CPO– CPOREF) voltage \nis lower than the CPOGOOD threshold voltage V CPO(UVL) , \nthe input supplies are prevented from powering the output. \nSee the Operation section for details of the initial start-up delay due to the time required to charge the CPO capacitor .\nCPOREF:  Charge Pump Reference Output.  This is the \nreference point for the charge pump, which is used to \nprovide overdrive to the GATE pins. Connect to the system \noutput voltage using a short PCB trace. Do not connect to the OUT1 or OUT2 sense resistor Kelvin connections.\nDISABLE1, DISABLE2:  Digital Inputs for Input Disconnect \nand Current Limit Fault Reset. Voltages below 1V prevent \nthe corresponding input V1, V2 supply from powering the output voltage. Driving DISABLE low, then high after a cur -\nrent limit fault resets the current limit timer circuitry and \nreleases the corresponding FAUL T pin high. Connecting \nDISABLE to the corresponding FAUL T pin configures the \ndevice in auto-retry mode, with a cool-down period between \nretries that is 1024 times longer than the current limit fault time. See Applications Information for more details. Tie to INTV\nCC or drive to a supply voltage above 1V if not used.\nEXTV CC: External High Priority Supply Input. When EXTV CC \nexceeds 2.45V, an internal LDO generates a low voltage supply rail from EXTV\nCC to power the low voltage inter -\nnal circuitry. Most of the LTC4421’s I CC is drawn from \nEXTV CC. Connect EXTV CC to a supply voltage ranging from \n3.0V to 36V. Connect EXTV CC to the output voltage (OUT1 \nor OUT2) to make the output voltage provide the internal \nbias current to the LTC4421. If unused, connect to ground, \nand the LDO will be powered from another supply.\nFAULT1, FAULT2:  Current Limit Fault Indicators. These \nopen-drain outputs pull low when an overcurrent fault \noccurs on their corresponding inputs and remain low dur -\ning the cool down cycle.

Connect these pins to the gates of the exter -\nnal back-to-back N-Channel MOSFETs. The charge pump \ndrives these pins with up to 12V of enhancement. Connect \na capacitor between each GATE pin and the sources of the \ncorresponding MOSFETs to compensate the current limit regulation loop.\nGND: Device Ground.INTV\nCC: Internal Low Voltage Supply Decoupling Output. \nAn internal LDO generates a low voltage rail to power the \nlow voltage internal circuitry. It is capable of supplying \nup to 500µA of external current. Connect a 1µF or larger \ncapacitor between this pin and ground to provide bypass -\ning. This pin has an undervoltage lockout threshold volt -\nage of 2.3V.OUT1, OUT2\n: Output Voltage Sense. The LTC4421 pre -\nvents input supplies from connecting to the correspond -\ning OUT until OUT is at least 35mV below the connecting \nsupply\n. These pins are also used in conjunction with the \nSENSE pins to set the current limit values for the input supplies. Connect OUT directly to the output side of the sense resistor with Kelvin connection. \nOV1, OV2: Overvoltage Comparator Inputs.

Connect a capacitor \nCQUAL from this pin to ground to set an OV , UV qualifica -\ntion time of 16ms/nF . Alternatively, connect this pin to \nINTV CC to set a default time of 3.5µs. Do not leave open.\nRETRY: Digital Input for Retry after Current Limit Fault. When this pin is above 1V, after a current limit fault dis -\nconnect occurs, the LTC4421 reconnects the input to the output up to 6 additional times, waiting for a cool down period between each reconnection. If current limit faults occur in each of 6 additional reconnections, the \nLTC4421 \nkeeps the input disconnected until the input’s DISABLE \npin is toggled. See the Applications section for more \ndetails. Connect to ground if unused. Do not leave open.\nSENSE1, SENSE2: Current Sense Non-Inverting Inputs. \nThe current limit regulation circuits control the GATE pins \nto limit the sense voltages between SENSE and OUT to \n25mV. If the OUT1 voltage drops below 0.45V, the regula -\ntion voltage is reduced from 25mV to 12.5mV. Connect \nSENSE1, SENSE2 directly to the input sides of the sense resistors with Kelvin connections.\nSHDN: Digital Input Shutdown to Disconnect Output and \nSet Low Current Mode. Voltages below 1V turn off all \nexternal MOSFETs, invalidate both channels and cause \nthe LTC4421 to enter a low current mode. CASOUT is \npulled high to allow a lower priority LTC4421 in a cas-\ncaded system to provide power to the output. All circuitry \nis debiased, except for the shutdown comparator and low \nvoltage rail generators, and total device current is reduced \nto 6µA. When SHDN  is driven back above 1V, the external \nMOSFETs are held off until the OV and UV comparators \nrevalidate. Connect to INTV CC if unused.\nSOURCE1, SOURCE2: Connections to Common Sources \nof External Back-to-Back N-Channel MOSFETs. Leave \nopen or connect to the sources of the external MOSFETs. \nTo minimize channel switchover time, a 5µA  pull-down \ncurrent biases the MOSFETs on the edge of conduction when their input supply is not connected to the output. \nAdd resistors from the MOSFET sources to ground to PIN FUNCTIONS\nincrease the MOSFET V GS bias voltage and reduce swi-\ntchover time.\nTMR1, TMR2:  Current Limit Fault Timers. Connect a capaci -\ntor between each TMR pin and ground to set a 83ms/µF \nduration for current limit before an overcurrent fault occurs. \nWhen a fault occurs, the external N-Channel MOSFETs are turned off and the corresponding FAUL T pin is pulled low. \nThe LTC4421 can be configured to latch-off, auto-retry \nindefinitely or auto-retry 6 additional times after an overcur -\nrent fault. See the Applications Information for more details.\nUVR1, UVR2:  Undervoltage Comparator Inputs for Rising \nVoltages. Rising input voltages that cross above 0.5V  \nare considered valid, provided that the OV pin voltage \nis below 0.5V. Connect UVR1 and UVR2 to a resistive \ndivider between the respective V1, V2 and ground to set the rising undervoltage threshold. Set the UVR threshold voltage above the corresponding UVF threshold voltage \nto ensure proper operation. See Applications Information \nsection for connecting unused UVR1 and UVR2 pins.\nUVF1, UVF2:  Undervoltage Comparator Inputs for \nFalling Voltages. Falling input voltages that cross below \n0.5V cause an undervoltage event. Connect UVF1 and \nUVF2 to a resistive divider between the respective V1, \nV2 and ground to set the falling undervoltage threshold. Set the UVR threshold voltage above the corresponding \nUVF threshold voltage to ensure proper operation. See \nApplications Information section for connecting unused UVF1 and UVF2 pins.\nV1, V2:  Input Power Supply Voltages. Typically V1 and V2  \nare connected to input supply voltages ranging from 3.0V  \nto 36V, but each supply can operate down to 0V, provided \nanother supply voltage ≥ 3.0V powers the LTC4421. In \nnormal operation, V1 is the higher priority supply and V2 is the lower priority supply. \nVALID1, VALID2: Voltage Valid Indicator Outputs. These \nopen-drain outputs pull low when their corresponding V1, \nV2 inputs are within their OV , UV window for the required \nqualification time. Connect pull-up resistors to a supply voltage less than or equal to 36V to provide the pull-up.

By definition, the supply con -\nnected to V1 is the higher priority supply, and the supply \nconnected to V2  is lower priority, although this can be \nchanged dynamically. The V1 voltage can be lower than, \nequal to or higher than the V2 voltage. \nAt initial power-up, the LTC4421 prevents the input sup -\nplies from validating and connecting to the output until it \nhas enough bias voltage to function properly\n. Referring \nto the Block Diagram, the LTC4421 prevents OV , UV \nvalidation and connection to the output until the INTV CC \nvoltage exceeds 2.3V  (VINT(UVL) ) as detected by com -\nparator INTV CC GOOD CP , the bandgap reference voltage \nhas reached its final regulated value as indicated by the BGGOOD signal, and the CPO voltage exceeds the higher \nof the CPOREF and INTV CC voltages by 6.7V (V CPO(UVL) ) as \ndetected by comparator CPOGOOD CP . With a 1µF  capaci-\ntor connected between CPO and CPOREF , the Charge \nPump/LDO circuit can take several hundred milliseconds to charge to 6.7V. See the Applications Information for methods to reduce the charging time.\nAfter initial power-up is complete, the LTC4421 moni -\ntors the V1 and V2 voltages via resistive dividers to pre -\ncision overvoltage (OV CP) and undervoltage (UV CP) \ncomparators. The UVR and UVF pins set the rising and falling undervoltage thresholds for the UV comparators. When an input voltage has been inside its OV , UV volt -\nage window for a time (t\nVALID ) set by the QUAL pin, it is \nconsidered valid and is eligible to power the output. If the input supply voltage falls out of the OV , UV window and remains outside for at least 3.5µs (t\nINVALID ), the supply is \ndisconnected from the output. Open drain output status \npins provide information regarding a channel’ s validity \nand connection status to the output. VALID1 and VALID2 \nare pulled low when V1 and V2, respectively, are valid. \nCH1 and C H2 are pulled low when V1  and V2, respectively, \nare powering V OUT.The GATE DRIVER circuit provides strong sourcing and sinking currents to external N-Channel MOSFETs to con -\nnect and disconnect the input supplies to and from the \noutput. When turning on the MOSFETs, GATE DRIVER \nsources current from the CPO pin to pull the GATE volt -\nage up to the CPO voltage. A charge pump regulates the CPO voltage \n12V (V GATE(CL) ) above the CPOREF voltage \nto provide 12V of V GS enhancement to the MOSFETs. \nStrong sinking currents ensure rapid turnoff of the \nexternal MOSFETs when a channel is no longer valid, a higher priority channel takes precedence or when com -\nparator REVCUR CP detects a reverse voltage of –25mV (V\nSNSDIS,REV ) across the external sense resistor .  Such a \nreverse voltage occurs when an input supply powering \nthe output is shorted. Fast charge and discharge of the \nexternal NMOS gates ensure fast switching between sup -\nplies, minimizing droop at the output. \nDuring channel transitions, monitoring circuitry prevents \ncross conduction between input supplies and reverse cur -\nrent from the output using a break-before-make archi -\ntecture. T wo V GS comparators (VGSOFF CPs) monitor \nthe disconnecting channel’s gate pin voltage (GATE1 or \nGATE2). When the GATE voltage is 600mV (V GS(OFF) ) \nlower than either the input or output voltage of the channel \nturning off, the V GS comparators determine the external \nN-channel MOSFETs to be off and allow the other channel \nto connect to the output. The V GS comparator outputs are \nlatched in the off state;  the latch is reset when the channel \nis commanded to turn back on.\nTo prevent reverse conduction from the output to the \ninputs during channel switchover , the reverse comparator \n(REV CP) monitors the connecting V1, V2 supply and the \ncorresponding OUT1, OUT2 output. The REV comparator \nprevents connection until the output droops 35mV (V REV) \nbelow the connecting supply. The connection is latched, resetting when the channel is commanded to disconnect.\nLTC4421\n12\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comThe current limit amplifier (I LIM AMP) monitors the load \ncurrent using the difference between the SENSE and OUT \npin voltages. The amplifier and gate driver work together to limit the current in the load by reducing the GATE-to-\nSOURCE voltage in an active control loop. The SENSE-to-\nOUT differential voltage is regulated to 25mV (ΔV SNS). An \nexternal sense resistor placed between SENSE and OUT \nsets the current limit value for each channel. Foldback \ncomparator (FOLDBACK CP) reduces the SENSE-to-\nOUT differential voltage from 25mV (ΔV SNS) to 12.5mV \n(ΔVSNS,FLD ) to conserve power when the OUT1 voltage is \nlow. The foldback comparator’s rising and falling thresh -\nold voltages are 460mV and 410mV , respectively. If the \nSENSE– OUT voltage on a channel remains in current limit \nfor the time programmed by the TMR pin, the LTC4421 registers a current limit fault. Additionally, pulsed output \nload currents exceeding current limit and occurring at \nduty cycles of 25% or higher will integrate over time and cause a current limit fault.\nWhen a current limit fault occurs, the LTC4421 discon -\nnects the channel and drives the FAUL T pin low to indicate \nthat a current limit fault has occurred. After a current \nfault occurs, driving DISABLE low initiates a cool down \nperiod that is 1024 times longer than the time-out period. \nDriving DISABLE back high terminates the cool-down \nperiod, resets FAUL T high and allows reconnection to the \noutput. Alternatively, if RETRY and DISABLE  are both high \nwhen a current limit fault occurs, the LTC4421 will try \nto reconnect up to 6 additional times after the first fault, \nwith a cool-down period between attempted connections that is 1024 times longer than the current limit fault time.\nDriving DISABLE1 and DISABLE2 low disconnects V1 and \nV2, respectively, from powering the output. The CASIN OPERATION\nand CASOUT pins of multiple LTC4421’s can be config -\nured to prioritize as many input supplies as desired. The \nDISABLE1, DISABLE2 and CASIN inputs are connected \nto comparators having 1V  (VTH) threshold and 150mV  \n(VTH,HYST ) hysteresis. See the Applications Information \nsection for circuits that use the DISABLE , FAUL T2 and \nVALID2  pins to redefine input supply priorities in real time \nand to prevent the primary input from powering the output \nuntil a valid back-up supply is available.\nDriving SHDN low causes the device to turn off the exter -\nnal N-Channel MOSFETs, enter a low current state and \ninvalidate V1 and V2. All circuitry is debiased except the \nINTV CC rail generator and shutdown comparator . The total \ninternal bias current is reduced dramatically to 6µA to \nconserve power . The INTV CC voltage is reduced to 3V and \nis powered from the highest of the V1, V2, EXTV CC and \nOUT1 voltages. The CASOUT pin is driven high to allow \na lower priority LTC4421 in a cascading application to \npower V OUT.\nWhen SHDN is driven high, the LTC4421 reactivates all \ncircuits. It may take several hundred milliseconds for a \nvalid input to connect to the output, because the external charge pump capacitor C\nCPO must charge to 6.7V before \nconnection is allowed.\nThe LTC4421 includes its own internally generated low \nvoltage rail (INTV CC) that provides power to the low volt -\nage sections of the device.  Because most of the device’s \nquiescent current is provided by INTV CC, the INTV CC \npower source is prioritized to minimize current draw from \nlower priority sources. The INTV CC rail is powered from \none of 4 prioritized sources. These sources in order of \npriority are EXTV CC, V1 and V2. If none of these three \ninputs is valid, INTV CC is powered by the highest of the \nV1, V2, EXTV CC and OUT1 voltages.\nLTC4421\n13\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comIntroduction\nHigh availability systems employ multiple input supplies \nto power a single common output. When individual sup -\nplies such as wall adapters and batteries are unplugged at \nvarious points in time, output power must not brown out as control of the output power is transferred to the other supply. Power ORing diodes are often used in these sys -\ntems, but the highest input supply voltage always pow-\ners the output. The LTC4421 powers the output from \nthe highest priority supply available, even if it is lower \nin voltage than the lower priority supplies. When switch -\ning between supplies, output voltage droop is minimized, \nand backfeeding current is prevented. A typical LTC4421 \napplication circuit is shown in Figure\xa01, where the primary APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\ninput supply is 12V and the secondary is 28V.

This voltage drop can cause UV faults that trigger a phenomenon called UV motorboating, where the input supply repeatedly connects and disconnects \nfrom the output. UV motorboating can lead to compo -\nnent damage and undesirable/erratic behavior . To pre -\nvent UV motorboating, set the V UVRISE  and V UVFALL  as \nfar apart as possible to maximize hysteresis and prevent \nchannel disconnect during the inrush. Ideally, quantify the \nworst-case input resistance R SRC,MAX , and set (V UVRISE -\nVUVFALL ) larger than (I LIM • RSRC,MAX ), where I LIM is the \ncurrent limit. The OV hysteresis is fixed at 10% above the OV threshold voltage.\nFor better accuracy, use one resistive divider per chan -\nnel to set the UVF and UVR thresholds, and a second, \nseparate resistive divider to set the OV threshold. For \nease of calculation, use three individual resistive divider \nstrings per channel – one for OV , one for UVF and one for \nUVR.

On a given channel, the LTC4421 \nregulates the maximum voltage across the SENSE and \nOUT pins to 25mV (ΔV SNS). Connect a sense resistor \nRSENSE  between SENSE and OUT to set the current limit \nvalue I LIM, is given by Equation 6.\n ILIM=25mV\nRSENSE  (6)\nEnsure the input supply is capable of sour\ncing more cur -\nrent than I LIM, so that the input supply does not drop out \nand cause UV motorboating. Use standard 1% resistor \nvalues and choose R SENSE  to set I LIM at least 25% higher \nthan the maximum output load current I LOAD(MAX)  to \naccount for tolerances in the current limit and to provide \nsufficient charging current to the output capacitor when charging the output.\nILIM and C OUT set the rate at which the output voltage \nwill rise. \nThe minimum output rise rate is shown by Equation 7.\n dVOUT\ndt(min) =ILIM–ILOAD(MAX) ( )\nCOUT  (7)\nEquation \n7 assumes that the output voltage is charging \nunder maximum output load current conditions, so that \nonly the difference between the programmed current limit current and the maximum DC load current is available to \ncharge C OUT. It is essential to set I LIM to ensure that \nthe output is fully charged before an overcurrent fault \ntimeout occurs.\nThe LTC4421 implements a stepped current limit foldback \nfeature. A foldback comparator monitors the voltage on the OUT1 pin and reduces the current limit regulation voltage from 25mV (ΔV\nSNS) to 12.5mV (ΔV SNS,FLD ) for low OUT1 \nvoltages, thereby cutting the current limit in half to reduce \npower consumption. The comparator rising and falling \nthreshold voltages are 460mV (V FLD,TH ) and 410mV, respec -\ntively. When the OUT1 voltage is initially being powered up \nfrom 0V, the current limit regulation voltage is 12.5mV until \nOUT1 rises above 460mV, at which point it is increased \nto 25mV. For output voltages below 460mV, ensure the \nmaximum output load current is lower than the foldback current limit to ensure the output powers up. When the OUT1 voltage is initially powered and then discharges, for example due to an input or output short circuit, the current \nlimit regulation voltage will be 25mV until OUT1 drops below \n410mV, at which point it is reduced to 12.5mV.\nUse Kelvin connections from the R SENSE  terminals to \nthe LTC4421’s SENSE and OUT pins for best accuracy. \nChoose sense resistors having low inductance to mini -\nmize the sense resistor’ s impact on the current limit regu -\nlation loop stability.

This prevents current from flowing from one input to \nthe other via the output, a phenomenon known as cross-conduction. As a result, there is a dead time during swi -\ntchover when neither supply is powering the output. \nUsers must choose an output capacitance C OUT to support \nthe output load current and minimize the output voltage step and droop during switchover . When the first channel disconnects, a voltage step occurs at the output due to the load current flowing through C\nOUT’s equivalent series \nresistance R ESR. The magnitude of the voltage step is \ngiven by Equation 8.\n  VSTEP = (ILOAD •  RESR) (8)\nFor the duration of the dead time, the output voltage \ndroops as the load current discharges C OUT. The maxi -\nmum magnitude of the droop is given by Equation 9.\n VDROOP=ILOAD(MAX) • tG(SWITCH),MAX ( )\nCOUT  (9)\nSet C OUT to optimize the trade-off between minimizing \noutput voltage droop and minimizing the time required to fully charge the output from 0V. Set V\nDROOP(MAX)  as high \nas possible; usually, V DROOP(MAX)  ≤ 0.1 • V OUT is accept -\nable. Typically, using 10µF to 50µF of output capacitance per Ampere of maximum load current achieves a reason -\nable trade-off. APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nFigure\xa04 shows an output voltage waveform during swi -\ntchover for a system having 5A output load current and a 220µF\n output capacitor with 100mΩ R ESR. When the \nfirst channel is turned off, the 5A load is provided by the \n220µF capacitor . With 5A flowing through the 100mΩ  \nRESR, VSTEP = 500mV. Following the ESR step, the output \ndischarges at a rate dV/dt = 5A/220µF until the second \nchannel is switched in.\nBecause of the high output currents, it is imperative \nto choose capacitors having very low ESR to minimize \nVSTEP. Also, consult the capacitor vendor’ s curves of \ncapacitance versus DC bias voltage and capacitance ver-\nsus temperature, and account for temperature and voltage \ncoefficients of C OUT. \nDetermining the Maximum Time to Charge the Output Voltage\nWhenever the output is being charged from a lower \nvoltage to a higher voltage, it charges in current limit. \nAs a result, the overcurrent fault timer is running dur -\ning charging. It is imperative to determine the maximum time t\n(CHG,MAX)  required to charge the output and set the \novercurrent fault time t TMR,FL T  > t(CHG,MAX) .

Choose MOSFETs having V GS,MAX  = ±20V, to \nhandle the LTC4421’s 14V maximum gate drive voltage. \nWhen the back-to-back MOSFETs turn on and conduct \ncurrent to the output, large drain-source voltages can \noccur on the input side MOSFET as the output is charg -\ning. However , the drain-source voltage of the output side \nMOSFET is limited to about 1V due to the body diode turn -\ning on, so the output side MOSFET is always in triode. As a result, the input side MOSFET has much more stringent SOA requirements. A MOSFET with lower SOA and lower \nVGS(TH)  can be used on the output side to minimize power \nloss in that MOSFET .  \nThe chosen MOSFET must be able to withstand an out -\nput short circuit for longer than t TMR,FL T . During output \nshorts, the LTC4421 regulates the short-circuit current \nusing its current limit regulation circuitry and runs the \novercurrent fault timer . When the short persists longer \nthan the programmed t TMR,FL T  time, the LTC4421 turns \noff the MOSFETs. The worst-case occurs when the out -\nput is resistively shorted and the output voltage, V SHORT , \nremains above the foldback comparator falling threshold \nvoltage, which is 410mV. In this case, the power during the short circuit is given in Equation 11.\n POWER≈VIN•ILIM=VIN• 25mV ( )\nRSENSE  (11)\nwhere V IN is in the input voltage and V IN >> V SHORT .\nLTC4421\n18\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comAfter calculating the power , refer to the SOA curves in the \nMOSFET manufacturer’s data sheet.

Most of the recommended MOSFETs \nhave T JMAX =175°C . As a result, multiply the y-axis values \nof the SOA curves by 0.6 for T A = 85°C, and multiply by \n0.333 for T A = 125°C. \nNote that MOSFET data sheets usually show a family \nof 5-6 SOA curves, with each curve separated from the next by a factor of 10 in time (e.g., 100µs, 1ms, 10ms, etc.). To be conservative, choose the time curve closest to and higher than t\nTMR,FL T  and make sure the MOSFET \ncan handle the power in Equation 11. \nWhen the output is hard-shorted to ground, such that the \noutput voltage is below 410mV, the LTC4421 implements \na stepped foldback feature, reducing the short circuit cur -\nrent, and hence the power , by a factor of two. As a result, \nthe LTC4421 provides more SOA margin for the MOSFET \nfor hard shorts than resistive shorts. See procedures out -\nlined in this section and the SOA curves in the chosen \nMOSFET manufacturer’ s data sheet to verify suitability \nfor the application.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nOvercurrent Faults and Retry\nThe LTC4421  features an adjustable current limit that protects \nagainst output short circuits and excessive load current. An overcurrent fault occurs when the current limit circuitry has been engaged for longer than the time set by the TMR pin. When the output load current is less than I\nLIM, the LTC4421  \npre-biases the TMR pin voltage to its DC TMR Parking \nVoltage. When the LTC4421 is regulating the output current \nto ILIM, it sources 6µA out of the TMR pin to charge the exter -\nnal TMR capacitor . When the TMR pin voltages increases \nby 500mV from the TMR Parking Voltage, an overcurrent \nfault\xa0occurs. The FAUL T open-drain output pull-down pin is latched low, and the input is disconnected from the output. \nConnect a capacitor C TMR between TMR and ground and use \nEquation 13 to set the overcurrent fault time t TMR,FL T .\n tTMR,FLT =CTMR• 83 µs/nF [ ] (13)\nNote that pulsed current loads exceeding the programmed \ncurrent limit and having duty cycle > 25% will integrate over time and cause a current limit fault.\nAfter an overcurrent fault occurs, the subsequent func -\ntionality depends on the configuration of the DISABLE, \nFAUL T and RETRY pins. Figure 6 shows a timing diagram \nfor an overcurrent fault occurring on Channel 1 where \nthe RETRY pin is set low, FAUL T1 is pulled up to a supply \nvoltage with a 100k resistor and the user drives DISABLE1  \nwith a digital signal.

At time t TMR,FL T  \nafter the short, an overcurrent fault occurs as described \nabove, and the LTC4421 drives FAUL T1 low. The user \ndetects FAUL T1 being low and drives DISABLE1 low to \ninitiate the cool down cycle.\nIn this example, the short circuit is released during the cool \ndown cycle, as indicated in the waveforms. Because V1 is disconnected from the output, the output voltage remains low when the short is released. At the end of cool-down, FAUL T1 releases high and the input is allowed to reconnect to the output. Driving DISABLE1 high reconnects Channel 1’s input to the output. With the output short removed, the \noutput successfully powers up, and no further faults occur . \nNote:  driving DISABLE1 low-to-high at any point in the \ncool down cycle asynchronously terminates the cool down \ncycle and allows reconnection to the output. It is strongly \nrecommended not to terminate the cool down cycle early, \nas the MOSFETs may not have sufficient time to cool \ndown, and the subsequent overcurrent fault time may be significantly shorter than the time set by the TMR pin.Figure\xa07 shows the functionality with RETRY = 0V, but \nwith the FAUL T1 pin connected to DISABLE1. In this case \nthe user does not drive DISABLE1. When the overcur -\nrent fault occurs, the FAUL T1 pin is driven low. Because FAUL T1 is connected to DISABLE1, DISABLE1 also pulls \nlow, initiating the cool down cycle. At the end of the cool \ndown cycle, the LTC4421 releases FAUL T1 high, which \ndrives DISABLE1 high, causing the V1 input supply to \nreconnect to the output, a process called “ auto-retry”. \nThis process repeats indefinitely until the output short \nis removed. In this example, the output short is released during the second cool down cycle, so the output voltage successfully powers up on the third connection.\nFigure\xa08 shows the functionality with DISABLE1 pulled \nhigh, FAUL T1 pulled up to a supply voltage with a 100k \nresistor but not connected to DISABLE1, and RETRY set high. In this example, we are leaving the output shorted \npermanently. In this case, the LTC4421 reconnects the V1  \nsupply 6 additional times after the first overcurrent fault \noccurs. Each reconnection results in an overcurrent fault, \nfollowed by a cool down cycle. After a total of 7 faults, the \nLTC4421 keeps the inputs disconnected from the output until the DISABLE1 is toggled low, then high.\nFigure\xa07. Auto-Retry After Overcurrent Fault on Channel 1.

Set the time to ensure the output can charge \nfrom 0V to the maximum input voltage, as described \nabove. Whenever Channel 1 experiences a current limit \nfault, Channel 2 is allowed to power the output, presuming \nChannel 2 is valid. Channel 2 powers the output until the \nfault on Channel 1 is cleared.\nThe RETRY count of 6 counter on a channel is reset when -\never its input supply is invalid, its DISABLE is driven low, or \na higher priority supply becomes valid. It is also reset when \nINTV CC is below the INTV CC GOOD Threshold Voltage and \nCPO is below the CPOGOOD Threshold Voltage. Toggling \nthe RETRY pin low, then high also resets the counter .\nIterating the Application Circuit Solution for MOSFET SOA\nIf the selected MOSFET does not meet the SOA require -\nments imposed by the initial current limit and output \ncapacitor values, take one or more of the following steps:\n1. Re duce t TMR,FL T  to meet the MOSFET SOA require-\nments. This requires reducing t (CHG,MAX)  from \nEquation 10 to ensure t TMR,FL T  > t(CHG,MAX) . One \nway to do this is to reduce C OUT. The trade-off is \nan increase in output voltage droop during channel \nswitchover . \n2. Reduce t TMR,FL T  and t (CHG,MAX)  by increasing the cur -\nrent limit I LIM. This is only helpful if the reduction \nin t(CHG,MAX)  provides a larger SOA benefit than the \nSOA loss caused by the increased power dissipated in the MOSFET . For example, assume I\nLIM = 11A and \nILOAD,CHG  = 10A. Using Equation 14.\n t(CHG,MAX) =(COUT• VIN,MAX)\n11A−10A=(COUT• VIN,MAX)\n1A  (14)\nIf ILIM is then increased from 11A to 20A, the new result is \ngiven by Equation 15.\n t(CHG,MAX) =(COUT• VIN,MAX)\n20A−10A=(COUT• VIN,MAX)\n10A  (15)\n W ith t (CHG,MAX)  reduced by a factor of 10, we can \nreduce t TMR,FL T  by a factor of 10. By doubling I LIM, \nthe maximum power during output short circuits has doubled, but t (CHG,MAX)  has decreased by a factor of \n10, so there is a net reduction in the SOA stress. Be sure the input power supply is capable of sourcing \nmore current than the new, higher value of I LIM. Also, \nensure the new I LIM does not cause UV motorboating.\n3. Choose a MOSFET with higher SOA. Look for  \nMOSFET’s having high BV DSS, as they usually have \nbetter SOA performance.\nCharge Pump and Gate Driver Circuitry\nThe gate drive is provided by a charge pump circuit \nthat powers CPO. A curve of GATE pin voltage versus \noutput voltage is shown in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics curves. For output voltages less than 4V, the minimum gate drive voltage is 9V. When the output voltage is higher than 5V, the gate drive is at least 10V. A burst mode comparator ensures the gate drive never exceeds 14V.\nWhen an input supply is invalid, the LTC4421 drives the \nGATE pin voltage close to ground using a 50mA pull-\ndown current. When a supply is valid but turned off, gate \ndriver parking circuitry regulates the GATE voltage to \n1V below the lower of the channel input voltage and the \noutput voltage. This is called the GATE Parking Voltage. \nThe LTC4421 also sinks 5µA from the SOURCE pin to \nbias the external MOSFETs at their threshold voltages, \nto minimize the ΔV GS and hence the turn-on time during \nchannel switchover when the MOSFETs are turned back \non. If possible, choose a lower threshold MOSFET for \nthe output MOSFET to preferentially draw the SOURCE \ncurrent from V OUT instead of the input supply of the off \nchannel, and add a resistor from SOURCE to ground to increase current and hence the V\nGS.\nCPO Charge Pump Capacitor Selection\nConnect a reservoir capacitor C CPO between CPO and \nCPOREF to provide the charge necessary to turn on the \nMOSFETs quickly. The recommended value is approxi -\nmately 10× the combined input C ISS capacitances of the \ntwo back-to-back MOSFETs on one channel, plus any dis -\ncrete GATE-to-SOURCE capacitor C G that has been added \nto stabilize the current limit loop. A larger C CPO capacitor \nLTC4421\n21\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comtakes a correspondingly longer time to charge up by the \ninternal charge pump, resulting in longer delays from ini -\ntial power-up of the first input supply to first connection to the output. A smaller capacitor suffers more voltage drop during a channel turn-on event as it shares charge \nwith C G and the MOSFET C ISS capacitances. Given the \nlimited charging capability of the charge pump, continu-\nously changing channels at rates higher than 80Hz  (typi-\ncal) eventually depletes the C CPO capacitor , causing dis-\nconnection of both inputs from the output. At that point, \nthe charge pump charges the C CPO capacitor above 6.7V, \nthe inputs are then allowed to reconnect to the output, and \nthe process repeats.\nAnalog Current Limit Loop Stability \nThe active current limit loop is compensated by adding a \ncapacitor C G between the gate and source of the external \nMOSFETs. Choosing 47nF for C G ensures stability for all \nrecommended MOSFETs. In addition, add a snubber from \nthe input supply to ground consisting of resistor R SN in \nseries with capacitor C SN. Choose R SN using Equation 16.\n  RSN=VIN\nILIM (16)\nwhere \nVIN is the maximum input supply voltage and I LIM \nis the current limit being set by R SENSE . Setting C SN to \n10µF works well for all applications. Applications having small input inductance and low output load current may use values as low as 1µF for C\nSN.\nSetting Qualification Time for Validity\nThe QUAL pin sets the amount of time a supply must \nbe inside the OV , UV voltage window to be valid. \nConnect a capacitor C QUAL from QUAL to ground and \nuse Equation 17 to set the validation time:\n  tVALID = CQUAL •  16[ms/nF ] (17)\nwhere t VALID  is the validation time. Note that the validation \ntime is the same for both channels. To set a fixed qualifi -\ncation time of 3.5µs, connect QUAL to INTV CC instead of \nconnecting a capacitor to ground.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nIf possible, set a qualification time on the order of 10ms \nor longer . This allows the LTC4421’s gate driver parking \ncircuitry to pre-bias the GATE1 voltage to its GATE Parking \nVoltage when hot-plugging the V1 input supply. This will reduce switchover time and hence output voltage droop when switching from Channel 2 to Channel 1.\nOptional Charge Pump Pre-Charge Circuit\nThe LTC4421 prevents the input supplies from being \nvalidated and powering the output until the external C CPO \ncapacitor voltage is charged to 6.7V (V CPO(UVL) ) above the \nhigher of the CPOREF and INTV CC voltages. With a typical \nCCPO capacitor of 1µF, the charge pump voltage may take \nseveral hundred milliseconds to charge to 6.7V. For input \nsupplies ≥ 12V, this time can be shortened by pre-charging \nthe CPO pin with the circuit shown in Figure\xa09. The 12V  \nZener diode Z1 and NPN transistor Q1 are used to quickly \ncharge the CPO voltage to about 10.8V above ground. For V1, V2 voltages below 12V, the circuit pre-charges CPO to a voltage approximately 1.8V below the higher of the \nV1 and V2 voltages. Diode D3 prevents reverse current \nconduction when an input supply is connected to V OUT \nand causes the CPO voltage to rise above 9V. Diodes D1  \nand D2 form a diode-OR circuit that powers the Z1 and Q1  \nfrom the higher of the V1 and V2 input supply voltages.\nFigure\xa09. Optional CPO Pre-Charge.

When SHDN is high and EXTV\nCC is connected to the \nsystem output voltage, the LTC4421 consumes 600µA  \nfrom the supply powering the output and only 10µA to \n26µA from the other supplies. When SHDN is low, the 6µA \n(typical) is drawn from the highest of the V1, V2, EXTV CC \nand OUT1 voltages, and the supply current in each of the other , lower voltage pins is a miniscule 250nA.\nDigital Status Outputs VALID1, VALID2, CH1, CH2\nThe LTC4421 provides open-drain pull-down digital out -\nputs to provide system status information. The V\n ALID1 \nand VALID2  pins pull low when their respective V1 and V2  \ninput supplies have been validated. The C H1 and C H2 pins \npull low when their input supply is connected to the output \nvoltage. Connect large value pull-up resistors between \nthese pins and INTV CC to provide the logic high, taking \ncare not to exceed the 500µA maximum current draw \nfrom INTV CC. The pull-downs are capable of driving low \npower LED’s, but they cannot be pulled up to INTV CC in \nthat case due to the LED current required. When using \nLED’s, power the pull-up from a supply voltage up to 36V. \nThese outputs can be used in conjunction with the DISABLE  \npins in a variety of application circuits to change V1, V2 pri -\nority over time. For example, consider what happens when \nCH2 is connected to DISABLE1. Once V2 is connected to \nthe output, it will continue to power the output regardless of \nV1’s validity. In effect, V2 became the higher priority supply, \nbut only after it connected to the output. This configuration \ncan be used in systems where, after switching to the sec-\nondary supply, it is desirable to run the secondary supply \nto full discharge before re-connecting to the primar\ny. For \nproper operation at power up, it is essential that Channel 1 becomes valid before Channel 2.\nIn Figure\xa010, logic gates U1 and U2 disable channel 1 \nwhenever V2  is valid, enabled and does not have a latched \novercurrent fault. Disabling channel 1 disconnects V1  from the output and allows V2 to connect to the output. \nThis configuration permanently flips V1 and V2 priority, \nso that V2 is always the higher priority input.\nIn Figure\xa011, inverter U1 is used to connect the logically \ninverted VALID2 signal to DISABLE1.

This ensures the reverse conduction paths from the output back to the master inputs are blocked before the slave is allowed to \npower the output. The master LTC4421 pulls CASOUT \nup to INTV CC using a 20µA current source, allowing the \nslave LTC4421 to connect its highest priority valid supply \nto the output.\nWhen the slave is powering the output and one of the \nmaster’ s inputs becomes valid, the master simultane -\nously connects its valid channel to the output and drives its CASOUT pin low to force the slave to disconnect its \ninputs. To prevent cross conduction, make the connection \nbetween the master’ s CASOUT and slave’ s CASIN as short \nas possible. This minimizes the capacitance of the con-\nnection and hence the turn-off delay of the slave channel.\nThis scheme can be extended to prioritize as many input \nsupplies as necessary. Connect each additional lower \npriority LTC4421’s OUT pins to the common output volt -\nage and connect its CASIN pin to the CASOUT pin of the \nnext \nhigher priority LTC4421. Note that driving the mas -\nter LT C4421’s CASIN pin low disconnects all input sup -\nplies in the system. Driving the master’s DISAB LE1 and \nDISABLE2 pins low disconnects the master’ s inputs from \nthe output and allows the slave LTC4421’s to connect to the output.\nFigure\xa013.

For simplicity, the same specifica -\ntions and hence the same component values are used for each channel.

The minimum and maximum operating ambient temperatures are – 40°C and 85°C , respectively.\nStart by setting the current limit to 16A, so that the out -\nput voltage can be charged at full DC load conditions in \na reasonable amount of time as shown by Equation 18 \n(from Equation 6).\n RSENSE=25mV\n16A=1.5625mΩ\n (18)APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nThe nearest standard value sense resistor is 1.5mΩ, \nwhich results in a current limit of 16.7A.\nChoose an electrolytic output capacitor having \nRESR\xa0=\xa050mΩ.

See Equation 22 (from Equation 13).\n CTMR1= 450µs\n83[µs/nF]⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟= 5.4nF\n (22)\nUsing the nearest standard value and accounting for tol -\nerance, we choose 6.8nF, which yields t TMR,FL T = 564µs.\nThe power dissipation during short circuits is given by \nEquation 23 (from Equation 11).\n  Power = (12V •  16.7A) = 200W (23)\nReferring to the SOA cur\nves in the PSMN4R060YS data \nsheet, the MOSFET can withstand 720W for 1ms at 25°C \nand 12V. Derating the SOA for the maximum operating temperature is given by Equation 24 (from Equation 12).\n SOA(85 °C) = 720W •(175 – 85)\n(175 – 25)= 432W at 1ms\n (24)\nOur overcurrent fault time-out will occur for 200W at \n564µs, so the requirement is satisfied.\nNext, select 47nF capacitors C G1 and C G2 to compensate \nthe current limit regulation loops of channels 1 and 2, \nrespectively. D1 and D2 are bidirectional T ransient Voltage \nSuppression (TVS) diodes that clamp the input voltages \nbelow 40V at channel turn-off, thereby protecting the \nLTC4421 and the N-Channel MOSFETs.\nThe OV , UV monitoring resistors should be chosen to yield \na total divider resistance of between 1MΩ and 2MΩ for \nboth low power and good transient response time. Using \nEquation 1 through Equation 4 and rounding up to the \nnearest 1% accurate standard resistor values, R1-R4 are calculated by Equation 25.\n   Choose R1 + R2 + R3 + R4 = 1000k Ω (25)From Equation 2, \nR1 = (0.5/15) • 1000kΩ = 33.3kΩ. The \nnearest standard resistor value is 33.2kΩ.\nFrom Equation 3, R2 = (15/11 – 1) • 33.2kΩ = 12.07kΩ. \nThe nearest standard value is 12.1kΩ.\nFrom Equation 4, R3 = (11/8 – 1) • (15/11) • 33.2kΩ = \n16.98kΩ. The nearest standard value is 16.9kΩ.\nFrom Equation 5, R4 = (15/0.5 – 1) • 33.2kΩ – 12.1kΩ – \n16.9kΩ = 933.8kΩ. The nearest standard value is 931kΩ.\nFrom Equation 17, C QUAL is set to 1nF to set an OV , UV \nvalidation time of 16ms. This gives the LTC4421 time to \npre-charge the GATE1 voltage to minimize turn-on time when V2 is powering the output and the V1 input supply is plugged in.\nPCB Layout Considerations\nTo achieve accurate current sensing, Kelvin connections \nare recommended for the sense resistors. The PCB lay-out for the sense resistors should be balanced and sym -\nmetrical to minimize wiring errors. In addition, the PCB \nlayout for the sense resistors and power MOSFETs should \ninclude good thermal management techniques for opti-\nmal device power dissipation. Small resistances add up \nquickly in high current applications. Note that \n1oz copper \nexhibits a sheet resistance of about 530µΩ/square. The \nminimum trace width for 1oz copper is 0.02" per amp \n(0.5mm per amp) to make sure the trace stays at a rea -\nsonable temperature. Using 0.03” per amp (0.8mm per amp) is recommended. \nT\no improve noise immunity, put the OV , UVR, UVF resis -\ntive dividers close to the LTC4421 and keep traces to GND \npin and the input supply pin short. It is also important to \nput C INTVCC , the bypass capacitor for the INTV CC pin, as \nclose as possible between INTV CC and GND. Place C CPO, \nthe charge pump reservoir capacitor , as close as possible \nbetween the CPO and CPOREF pins. T ransient voltage sup -\npressors D1 and D2 are located close to the LTC4421 and \nare connected between the input supply and ground using \nwide traces. Figure\xa015 shows a recommended PCB layout \nfor a 2-layer board.\nLTC4421\n27\nRev. 0 For more information www.analog.comPreventing Input Hold-Up During Unplug Events\nFigure\xa016 includes a backplane connector with a kelvin \nsense. The resistive divider network that sets the OV \nand UV thresholds is connected to the kelvin sense. \nDisconnecting the supply powering V1 causes a nearly \nimmediate UV fault, because there is no hold-up capaci -\ntance on the OV1, UVF1 or UVR1 pins. The output volt -\nage discharges minimally before the UV fault occurs, as the output discharge rate is ver\ny slow compared to the \nUV fault time. Without a kelvin sense connection, upon \ninput supply disconnection the resistive divider would \nstay connected to the drain of M1. The output, OV1, UVF1  \nand UVR1 pin voltages would all fall at the rate dictated by the output discharge, and the channel would not be disconnected until the output voltage dropped below the UVF1 threshold voltage.APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nSOA Doubler\nMultiple LTC4421’ s can be used to control parallel MOSFET \npathways from each input to the output, as shown in Figure\xa017. \nThis is valuable in very high current applications to cut the \nSOA and load current carrying burdens of each MOSFET in half. LTC4421 #1 acts as a master and performs all monitor -\ning functions, including OV , UV , fault and reverse current. After \nLTC4421 #2 drives the VALID12 and VALID22 signals low to indicate that it has successfully powered up, it acts as a slave to LTC4421\xa0#1, turning its external MOSFETs on and off at \nLTC4421\xa0#1 ’s command. Connecting LTC4421 #1’ s CH1 and \nCH2 outputs through inverters U3 and U4 to LTC4421 #2’s \nDISABLE1 and DISABLE2 inputs, respectively, synchronizes \nchannel turn-on and turn-off of the two LTC4421’ s. NOR gates \nU1 and U2 prevent LTC4421 #1 from turning on its MOSFETs \nuntil LTC4421 #2’ s inputs are validated. This ensures that \nLTC4421 #1 never turns on its MOSFETs when LTC4421 #2 is unable to turn on its MOSFETs.Figure\xa015.
