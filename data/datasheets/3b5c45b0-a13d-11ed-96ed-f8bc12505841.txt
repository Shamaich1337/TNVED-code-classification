All devices operate from a single 2.7 V to 5.5 V \nsupply and are guaranteed monotonic by design. \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R have an on-chip reference. \nThe AD56x4R-3 has a 1.25 V, 5 ppm /°C reference, giving a full-\nscale output range of 2.5 V; the AD56x4R-5 has a 2.5 V, 5 ppm/°C reference giving a full-scale output range of 5 V. The on-chip reference is off at power-up, allowing the use of an \nexternal reference; all devices can be operated from a single \n2.7 V to 5.5 V supply. The intern al reference is enabled via a \nsoftware write. \nThe part incorporates a power-on  reset circuit that ensures the \nDAC output powers up to 0 V and remains there until a valid \nwrite takes place. The part cont ains a per-channel power-down \nfeature that reduces the current consumption of the device to 480 nA at 5 V and provides software-selectable output loads while in power-down mode. The low power consumption of this part in normal operation makes it ideally suited to portable battery-operated equipment. \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R use a versatile 3-wire serial \ninterface that operates at clock rates up to 50 MHz, and is com-\npatible with standard SPI, QSPI™, MICROWIRE™, and DSP \ninterface standards. The on-chip precision output amplifier \nenables rail-to-rail output swing. \nPRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Quad 12-/14-/16-bit DACs. \n2. On-chip 1.25 V/2.5 V, 5 ppm/°C reference. \n3.

Multiplying Bandwidth \n \nAD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R Data Sheet\n \nRev. D | Page 18 of 28 TERMINOLOGY \nRelative Accuracy or Integral Nonlinearity (INL) \nFor the DAC, relative accuracy or integral nonlinearity is a \nmeasurement of the maximum deviation, in LSBs, from a straight line passing through the endpoints of the DAC transfer \nfunction. A typical INL vs. code plot can be seen in Figure 5. \nDifferential Nonlinearity (DNL) \nDifferential nonlinearity is the difference between the measured \nchange and the ideal 1 LSB change between any two adjacent codes. A specified differential nonlinearity of ±1 LSB maximum ensures monotonicity. This DAC is guaranteed monotonic by \ndesign. A typical DNL vs. code pl ot can be seen in Figure 8. \nZero-Code Error Zero-scale error is a measurement of the output error when \nzero code (0x0000) is loaded to  the DAC register. Ideally, the \noutput should be 0 V. The zero-c ode error is always positive in \nthe AD5664R because the output of the DAC cannot go below \n0 V due to a combinat ion of the offset errors in the DAC and \nthe output amplifier. Zero-cod e error is expressed in mV. A \nplot of zero-code error vs. temperature can be seen in Figure 27.  \nFull-Scale Error \nFull-scale error is a measurement of the output error when full-\nscale code (0xFFFF) is loaded to the DAC register. Ideally, the \noutput should be V\nDD − 1 LSB. Full-scale error is expressed in \npercent of full-scale range. A plot of full-scale error vs. temperature can be seen in Figure 26.  \nGain Error \nThis is a measure of the span error of the DAC. It is the deviation \nin slope of the DAC transfer characteristic from the ideal \nexpressed as % of FSR.  \nZero-Code Error Drift \nThis is a measurement of the change in zero-code error with a change in temperature. It is expressed in μV/°C.  \nGain Temperature Coefficient  \nThis is a measurement of the change in gain error with changes in temperature. It is expressed in ppm of FSR/°C.  \nOffset Error \nOffset error is a measure of the difference between V\nOUT \n(actual) and V OUT (ideal) expressed in mV in  the linear region of \nthe transfer function. Offset e rror is measured on the AD5664R \nwith code 512 loaded in the DAC re gister. It can be negative or \npositive. \nDC Power Supply Rejection Ratio (PSRR) \nThis indicates how the output of the DAC is affected by changes in the supply voltage. PSRR is the ratio of the change in V\nOUT to a change in V DD for full-scale output of the DAC. It is \nmeasured in dB. V REF is held at 2 V, and V DD is varied by ±10%. Output Voltage Settling Time This is the amount of time it takes for the output of a DAC to settle to a specified level for a ¼ to ¾ full-scale input change and is measured from the 24\nth falling edge of SCLK. \nDigital-to-Analog Glitch Impulse Digital-to-analog glitch impulse is the impulse injected into the \nanalog output when the input code in the DAC register changes \nstate. It is normally specified as  the area of the glitch in nV-s, \nand is measured when the digital input code is changed by 1 LSB at the major carry tran sition (0x7FFF to 0x8000) (see \nFigure 41). \nDigital Feedthrough \nDigital feedthrough is a measure of the impulse injected into \nthe analog output of the DAC from the digital inputs of the \nDAC, but is measured when the DAC output is not updated. It is specified in nV-s, and measured with a full-scale code change on the data bus, that is, from all 0s to all 1s and vice versa. \nReference Feedthrough \nReference feedthrough is the ratio of the amplitude of the signal at the DAC output to the reference input when the DAC output \nis not being updated. It is expressed in dB. \nNoise Spectral Density  \nThis is a measurement of the internally generated random \nnoise. Random noise is characterized as a spectral density (nV/√Hz). It is measured by lo ading the DAC to midscale and \nmeasuring noise at the output. It is measured in nV/√Hz. A plot of noise spectral density can be seen in Figure 47. \nDC Crosstalk \nDC crosstalk is the dc change in  the output level of one DAC in \nresponse to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured with a full-scale output change on one DAC (or soft power-down and power-up) while monitoring another DAC kept at midscale. It is expressed in μV. \nDC crosstalk due to load current change is a measure of the \nimpact that a change in load current on one DAC has to another DAC kept at midscale. It is expressed in μV/mA. \nDigital Crosstalk  This is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC \nat midscale in response to a full- scale code change (all 0s to all \n1s and vice versa) in the input register of another DAC. It is \nmeasured in standalone mode and is expressed in nV-s. \nData Sheet AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R\n \nRev. D | Page 19 of 28 Analog Crosstalk \nThis is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC due to a change in the output of another DAC. It is measured by loading one of the input registers with a full-scale code \nchange (all 0s to all 1s and vice versa). Then execute a software \nLDAC and monitor the output of the DAC whose digital code was not changed. The area of the glitch is expressed in nV-s.  \nDAC-to-DAC Crosstalk \nThis is the glitch impulse transferred to the output of one DAC due to a digital code change and subsequent analog output change of another DAC. It is measured by loading the attack \nchannel with a full-scale code chan ge (all 0s to all 1s and vice \nversa) using the command write to and update while monitor-ing the output of the victim channel that is at midscale. The energy of the glitch is expressed in nV-s. Multiplying Bandwidth The amplifiers within the DAC have a finite bandwidth. The multiplying bandwidth is a measure of this. A sine wave on the reference (with full-scale code loaded to the DAC) appears on \nthe output. The multiplying bandwidth is the frequency at \nwhich the output amplitude falls to 3 dB below the input. \nTotal Harmonic Distortion (THD) \nThis is the difference between an ideal sine wave and its attenuated version using the DAC. The sine wave is used as the reference for the DAC, and the THD is a measurement of the harmonics present on the DAC output. It is measured in dB. \n \nAD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R Data Sheet\n \nRev.

The architecture  consists of a string DAC \nfollowed by an output buffer amplifier. Figure 51 shows a block diagram of the DAC architecture. \nDAC\nREGISTERVDD\nGNDVOUTOUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER\n(GAIN = +2)\n05856-032VREFIN\nRESISTOR\nSTRINGREF\n \nFigure 51.

It is simply a string of resistors, each of value R. The code loaded to the DAC register determines at which node on the string the voltage is tapped off to be fed into the output amplif ier. The voltage is tapped off by \nclosing one of the switches connecting the string to the amplifier. Because it is a string of resistors, it is guaranteed \nmonotonic. \nOUTPUT AMPLIFIER \nThe output buffer amplifier can ge nerate rail-to-rail voltages on \nits output, which gives an output range of 0 V to V DD. It can drive \na load of 2 kΩ in parallel with 1000 pF to GND. The source and sink capabilities of the output amplifier can be seen in Figure 34 and Figure 35. The slew rate is 1.8 V/μs with a ¼ to ¾ full-scale settling time of 7 μs. \n R\nR\nR\nRR TO OUTPUT\nAMPLIFIER\n05856-033 \nFigure 52. Resistor String \nINTERNAL REFERENCE \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R on-chip reference is off at \npower-up and is enabled via a write to a control register. See the \nInternal Reference Setup section for details. \nThe AD56x4R-3 has a 1.25 V, 5 ppm /°C reference gi ving a full-\nscale output of 2.5 V. The AD56x4R-5 has a 2.5 V, 5 ppm/°C \nreference giving a full-scale output of 5 V. The internal reference associated with each part is available at the V\nREFOUT  \npin. A buffer is required if the reference output is used to drive external loads. When using the internal reference, it is \nrecommended that a 100 nF ca pacitor is placed between \nreference output and GND for reference stability. \nEXTERNAL REFERENCE \nThe V REFIN pin on the AD56x4R-3 an d AD56x4R-5 allows the \nuse of an external reference if the application requires it. The \ndefault condition of the on-chip reference is off at power-up. All devices (AD56x4R-3 and th e AD56x4R-5) can be operated \nfrom a single 2.7 V to 5.5 V supply. \nSERIAL INTERFACE \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R have  a 3-wire serial interface \n(SYNC , SCLK, and DIN) that is compatible with SPI, QSPI, and \nMICROWIRE interface standards as well as with most DSPs. See \nFigure 2 for a timing diagram of a typical write sequence. \nThe write sequence begins by bringing the SYNC  line low. Data \nfrom the DIN line is clocked into the 24-bit shift register on the \nfalling edge of SCLK. The serial clock frequency can be as high as 50 MHz, making the AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R compat-\nible with high speed DSPs. On the 24\nth falling clock edge, the \nlast data bit is clocked in and the programmed function is \nexecuted, that is, a change in DAC register contents and/or a \nchange in the mode of operation.  \nData Sheet AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R\n \nRev. D | Page 21 of 28 At this stage, the SYNC  line can be kept low or be brought high. In \neither case, it must be brought hi gh for a minimum of 15 ns before \nthe next write sequence so that a falling edge of SYNC  can initiate \nthe next write sequence.  \nBecause the SYNC  buffer draws more current when V IN = 2 V \nthan it does when V IN = 0.8 V, SYNC  should be idled low \nbetween write sequences for even lower power operation. As \nmentioned previously, it must, however, be brought high again \njust before the next write sequence. \nINPUT SHIFT REGISTER \nThe input shift register is 24 bits wide (see Figure 53). The first \ntwo bits are don’t care bits. The next three are the command \nbits, C2 to C0 (see Table 8), followed by the 3-bit DAC address, A2 to A0 (see Table 9), and then the 16-, 14-, 12-bit data-word. The data-word comprises the 16-, 14-, 12-bit input code \nfollowed by 0, 2, or 4 don’ t care bits, for the AD5664R, \nAD5644R, and AD5624R, respectively (see Figure 53, Figure 54, and Figure 55). These data bits are transferred to the DAC register on the 24\nth falling edge of SCLK. Table 8.

D | Page 22 of 28 POWER-ON RESET \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R family contains a power-\non reset circuit that controls the output voltage during power-up. The output of the AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R DACs powers up to 0 V and the output remains there until a valid write \nsequence is made to the DACs. This is useful in applications where \nit is important to know the state of the output of the DACs while they are in the process of powering up. \nSOFTWARE RESET \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R contain a software reset function. Command 101 is reserv ed for the software reset \nfunction (see Table 8). The software reset command contains two reset modes that are software  programmable by setting bit \nDB0 in the control register.  \nTable 10 shows how the state of the bit corresponds to the \nsoftware reset modes of op eration of the devices.  \nTable 12 shows the contents of the input shift register during \nthe software reset mode of operation.  \nTable 10.

Command 100 is reserved for the power-down \nfunction (see Table 8). These modes are software programmable by setting two bits (DB5 and DB4) in the control register. Table 11 shows how the state of the bits corresponds to the mode of \noperation of the device. All DACs (DAC D to DAC A) can be \npowered down to the selected mode by setting the correspond-ing four bits (DB3, DB2, DB1, and DB0) to 1.  By executing the same Command 100, any combination of DACs \ncan be powered up by setting the bits (DB5 and DB4) to normal operation mode. To select which combination of DAC channels to power-up, set the correspondin g four bits (DB3, DB2, DB1, \nand DB0) to 1. See Table 13 for contents of the input shift register during power-down/power-up operation. \nTable 11.

Not only does the supply \ncurrent fall, but the output stag e is also internally switched \nfrom the output of the amplifier to a resistor network of known values. This allows the output impedance of the part to be \nknown while the part is in power-down mode. The outputs can either be connected internally to GND through a 1 kΩ resistor, \nor left open-circuited (three-state) as shown in Figure 57. \nRESISTOR\nNETWORKVOUTRESISTOR\nSTRING DAC\nPOWER-DOWN\nCIRCUITRYAMPLIFIER\n05856-038 \nFigure 57.

D | Page 23 of 28 LDAC FUNCTION \nThe AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R DACs have double-\nbuffered interfaces consisting of two banks of registers: input registers and DAC registers. The input registers are connected directly to the input shift register and the digital code is trans-\nferred to the relevant input regi ster on completion of a valid \nwrite sequence. The DAC registers contain the digital code \nused by the resistor strings.  \nThe double-buffered interface is useful if the user requires \nsimultaneous updating of all DA C outputs. The user can write \nto three of the input registers individually and then write to the \nremaining input register, updati ng all DAC registers simulta-\nneously. Command 010 is reserved  for this software LDAC.  \nAccess to the DAC registers is controlled by the LDAC function. \nThe LDAC register contains two modes of operation for each \nDAC channel. The DAC channels are selected by setting the  bits of the 4-bit LDAC register (DB3, DB2, DB1, and DB0). Command 110 is reserved for setting up the LDAC register. When the LDAC bit register is set low, the corresponding DAC registers are latched and the in put registers can change state \nwithout affecting the contents of the DAC registers. When the LDAC bit register is set high, however, the DAC registers become transparent and the conten ts of the input registers are \ntransferred to them on the falling edge of the 24\nth SCLK pulse. \nThis is equivalent to having an LDAC  hardware pin tied perma-\nnently low for the selected DAC channel, that is, synchronous update mode. See Table 14 for the LDAC register mode of \noperation. See Table 16 for contents of the input shift register \nduring the LDAC register setup command. This flexibility is useful in applications where the user wants to update select channels simultan eously, while the rest of the \nchannels update synchronously.  \nTable 14. LDAC Register Mode of Operation \nLDAC Bits  \n(DB3 to DB0) LDAC Mode of Operation  \n0 Normal operation (default), DAC register \nupdate is controlled by write command. \n1 The DAC registers are updated after new data is read in on the falling edge of the 24\nth SCLK pulse. \nINTERNAL REFERENCE SETUP  \nThe on-chip reference is off at power-up by default. This reference \ncan be turned on or off by setti ng a software programmable bit, \nDB0, in the control register. Ta ble 15 shows how the state of the \nbit corresponds to the mode of operation. Command 111 is \nreserved for setting up the inte rnal reference (see Table 8).  \nTable 16 shows how the state of the bits in the input shift register corresponds to the mode of operation of the device during internal reference setup. \nTable 15.

SCK of the 68HC11/68L11 drives the SCLK of the AD5624R/ \nAD5644R/AD5664R, while the MOSI output drives the serial \ndata line of the DAC. \nThe SYNC\n signal is derived from a port line (PC7). The setup \nconditions for correct operation of  this interface are that the \n68HC11/68L11 is configured with its CPOL bit as 0 and its \nCPHA bit as 1. When data is transmitted to the DAC, the \nSYNC  line is taken low (PC7).

Serial data \nfrom the 68HC11/ 68L11 is transmitted in 8-bit bytes with only eight falling clock \nedges occurring in the transmit cycle. Data is transmitted MSB \nfirst. To load data to the AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R, PC7 is left low after the first eight bits are transferred, and a second serial write operation is performed to the DAC; PC7 is taken high at the end of this procedure. \n68HC11/68L11 1\nSYNC PC7\nSCLK SCK\nDIN MOSI\n1ADDITIONAL PINS OMITTED FOR CLARITY.AD5624R/\nAD5644R/\nAD5664R1\n05856-040 \nFigure 59. 68HC11/68L11 Interface to AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R to 80C51/80L51 Interface \nFigure 60 shows a serial interface between the AD5624R/ \nAD5644R/AD5664R and the 80C51/80L51 microcontroller. The \nsetup for the interface is that the TxD of the 80C51/80L51 drives \nSCLK of the AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R, while RxD drives the \nserial data line of the part. The SYNC  signal is derived from a bit-\nprogrammable pin on the port. In this case, port line P3.3 is used. \nWhen data is transmitted to the AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R, P3.3 is taken low.

D | Page 25 of 28 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nUSING A REFERENCE AS A POWER SUPPLY FOR \nTHE AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R \nBecause the supply current requ ired by the AD5624R/AD5644R/ \nAD5664R is extremely low, an al ternative option is to use a \nvoltage reference to supply the required voltage to the part (see \nFigure 62). This is especially useful if the power supply is quite \nnoisy, or if the system supply voltages are at some value other than 5 V or 3 V, for example, 15 V. The voltage reference outputs a steady supply voltage for the AD5624R/AD5644R/ AD5664R (see Figure 60). If the low dropout REF195 is used, it \nmust supply 450 μA of current to the AD5624R/AD5644R/ AD5664R with no load on the ou tput of the DAC. When the \nDAC output is loaded, the REF195 also needs to supply the current to the load. The total current required (with a 5 kΩ load on the DAC output) is \n450 μA + (5 V/5 kΩ) = 1.45 mA \nThe load regulation of the REF195 is typically 2 ppm/mA, resulting in a 2.9 ppm (14.5 μV ) error for the 1.45 mA current \ndrawn from it. This corresp onds to a 0.191 LSB error. \n3-WIRE\nSERIAL\nINTERFACESYNC\nSCLK\nDIN15V\n5V\nVOUT = 0V TO 5VVDDREF195\nAD5624R/\nAD5644R/\nAD5664R\n05856-043 \nFigure 62.

If the AD5624R/ AD5644R/AD5664R are in a system  where other devices require \nan AGND-to-DGND connection, the connection should be made at one point only. This ground point should be as close as possible to the AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R. \nThe power supply to the AD 5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R should \nbe bypassed with 10 μF and 0.1 μF capacitors. The capacitors \nshould be located as close as possible to the device, with the \n0.1 μF capacitor ideally right up against the device. The 10 μF \ncapacitor is the tantalum bead type. It is important that the 0.1 μF capacitor have low effect ive series resistance (ESR) and \neffective series inductance (ESI), for example, common ceramic types of capacitors. This 0.1 μF capacitor provides a low imped-ance path to ground for high fr equencies caused by transient \ncurrents due to internal logic switching. \nThe power supply line itself should have as large a trace as \npossible to provide a low impedance path and to reduce glitch effects on the supply line. Cloc ks and other fast switching \ndigital signals should be shielded  from other parts of the board \nby digital ground. Avoid crossover of digital and analog signals if possible. When traces cross on  opposite sides of the board, \nensure that they run at right an gles to each other to reduce \nfeedthrough effects through the board. The best board layout \ntechnique is the microstrip technique where the component \nside of the board is dedicated to the ground plane only and the signal traces are placed on the solder side. However, this is not always possible with a 2-layer board. \n \nData Sheet AD5624R/AD5644R/AD5664R\n \nRev.
