This device provides \nsuperior line and load regulations , cycle -by-cycle current \nlimit, fast transient response and pre- biased startup \ncapability, all with a simple passive compensation \nnetwork. An internal precision reference voltage and  a \nfixed soft -start timer are included. Several protection \nfeatures such as input under -voltage lockout, output \nover-voltage protection, short -circuit, cycle -by- cycle \nover-current protection, and thermal shutdown are \nintegrated to ensure safe operation.  Constant  On-Time Control  \nIn conventional voltage mode control (VMC) or current \nmode control (CMC) converter s, a fixed frequency clock  \ntiming signal generates a sawtooth ramp that is \ncompared with the compensation network outpu t to \nadjust the PWM duty cycle ( on-time) as control variable \nand regulate the output voltage. The compensator uses \nthe voltage and/or current feedback(s) to govern the \ncontrol variable and keep the output regulated with fast reaction to load or V\nIN variati ons. The existence of the \ncompensator in VMC or CMC converter  inherently \nintroduces some delay in the loop response. Unlike VMC or CMC, the constant on- time (COT ) control is a \nhysteretic mode control without any clock signal or compensation amplifier. Each switching cycle is started \n  \nHigh Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  \nSGM 61720  Synchronous Buck  Converter  \n \n 9 MAY 2023 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  \nwith a constant on-time pulse when an internal \ncomparator senses that the output voltage is fallen \nbelow the desired output voltage. Output voltage is \nsensed by the feedback  (FB) pin through an  output \nresistor divider and is compared to the internal reference \nvoltage  (VREF) with a low gain error amplifier. The \namplifier output is sent to a comparator and when the \nfeedback voltage (VFB) falls below V REF, the comparator \ntriggers the on-time control logic that turns on the \nhigh-side switch. The on -time (tON) is determined by V IN \nas approximated by  Equation 1: \n= ×+−ON DELAY\nIN0.158 (M Ω)t (μs) 96 tV 0.4       (1)\n \nwhere tDELAY is almost 50ns (0.05µ s). For higher V IN \nvalues , the -0.4V term can be ignored.  \nAt the end of the on- time, the high- side MOSFET  is \nturned off and after a very short dead- time the low -side \nMOSFET is turned on. The dead- time is implemented \nin the drivers to prevent shoot -through. The off -time \ncontinues until the VFB falls below V REF threshold again \nand ripple comparator triggers a new on -time pulse. \nEach cycle starts when the V FB falls below VREF. The \ncontroller does not allow the off -time to be shorter than \n200ns  (MIN)  to ensure enough c harge is received by \nthe bootstrap capacitor for powering the high- side \ndriver and also to provide sufficient time for the cur rent \nsensing circuit in the low -side switch to measure \ncurrent. The short blanking time is required to avoid \nswitching transition noise that may interfere with the \ncurrent measurement.  \nFigure 3 shows the basic timings of the COT converter \nwhen it is operating in continuous conduction mode \n(CCM) in which the inductor c urrent stays above zero \nduring the whole switching cycle. With ligh t load , the \ninductor current reaches zero that will be discussed \nlater.  During the on-time, the inductor current has a \nrising slope and during the off -time it will be decreasing. \nThe next on-time pulse starts when the V FB falls below \nVREF threshold. The required V FB ripple (peak -to-peak) range for proper detection by ripple amplifier and comparator for stable PWM operation is roughly \nbetween 30mV to 200mV. Note that based on the \noperating principle of the COT converter, the ripple has \nto be in phase with the inductor ripple for stable \noperation, that is, when the inductor current is at its \nvalley and the on -time needs to be started, the V\nFB \nvoltage should also be at the lowest to trigger the \ncomparator and start the on -pulse in the right ti me. If \nthere is a considerable phase delay in the ripple, the \non-pulse s start at the wrong times and COT pulse \ntiming will not be stable (unstable frequency). With low \nESR capacitors, lack of proper ripple phase or \nmagnitude may occur, and cause stability issues as will \nbe discussed later.  \nLΔI\n()≈×OUT L PPΔV ESR ΔI\n() = ×+FB OUT 2 1 2ΔV ΔV R/R RIL\nIOUT\nVOUT\nVFB\nVREF\nSWComparator\nTimeInductor Ripple\nOutput Ripple\nOUTΔV\nFBΔVFeedback Ripple\nOFFON\nT=1/f StON tOFF\n \nFigure 3.

A \nreal output capacitor has a parasitic ESR (equivalent \nseries resistance) that results in two main components \nin the output voltage ripple (∆VOUT). Almost all inductor \ncurrent ripple ( AC component or ∆IL) passes through \nthe output capacitor while the DC current (I L) goes to \nthe load. The AC current multiplied by the ESR of the \ncapacitor produces the ESR component of the voltage ripple ( V\nrr = ESR ⨯ ∆IL) that is clearly in phase with the \ninductor ripple. However, the capacitive ripple component  \nis due to the AC voltage variation of the capacitor which \nis caused by the charge and discharge with the inductor \nAC current. For the component (harmonic) of the \ninductor current, the capacitive ripple is almost (V cr ≈ \n∆IL/8fSC) which is 90° lag compared to the resistive \nripple (Vrr) component.  \nThe actual ripple includes higher order switching harmonics , but the main harmonic (at f\nS) is usually the \ndominant component and by ignoring the higher order \ncomponents, the overall phase lag of the output voltage \nripple is estimated by the relative magnitudes of resistive  (ESR ) and capacitive ripple component s (ESR \nand │Z\nC│=1/2πfSC). The phase lag is given by \ntan-1((2πfSC⨯ESR)-1). All lags and delays caused by the \nfeedback network, parasitic elements of the FB path and \nthe amplifier /comparator delays, should be considered for \nthe evaluation of the actual feedback phase lag that \naffect the stability.  \nAs an example, for a 100 μF ceramic capacitor with \nESR = 2mΩ and operating at f S = 500k Hz, the phase \nlag will be around 57° that is significant. However, for a 300μ F capacitor with ESR  = 10mΩ operating at 1MHz, \nthe lag will be only 3°. Higher switching frequency may \nimprove stability;  however , significant phase lag may \nbe introduced by t he low gain amplifier and comparator \nat higher fr equencies. Moreover, minimum on- time will \nlimit the step -down ratio at higher frequencies, so a \ncompromised frequency should to be considered. \nHigher output capacitance is usually implemented by \nparalleling more capacitors that inherently reduces the \ntotal effective ESR of the output capacitor due to parallel operation. While high ESR is not normally desired for better efficiency and higher RMS  current \nhandling (less heating) in the capacitors, it is generall y \npreferred for stable COT operation. Therefore, a compromise is always needed for proper design of \noutput capacitor to satisfy design requirements.  \nAs ceramic capacitors are now commonly used for \nmost applications, some ripple injection techniques are \npresented for stable operation of COT converters with \nlow ESR capacitors as will be explained later.  \nPower Supply Select  \nThe power for internal circuit is taken from V IN when \nVOUT is less than 5V, during power -up or when V OUT \nsetting is less than 5V. When V OUT > 5V, the internal \npower supply will switch to the V OUT to reduce losses.  \nPower -Save Mode \nConsidering power usage, the SGM61720 has three \nmain operating modes: PWM mode, power -save mode \nand sleep mode. When the SGM61720 operates in \ncontinuous  conduction mode (CCM)  with heavy load, \nthe device operates in PWM mode with an almost \nconstant frequency. When it operates in discontinuous \nconduction mode (DCM)  with light load,  the SGM61720  \ngoes into the power -save mode in which internal power \ndissipatio n is significantly reduced. Moreover, the \noperating frequency starts to drop depending on the \nload. At very light load and when the off -time exceeds \n10μs, device goes to the sleep mode to lower inter nal \ndissipation.  \nThe details are explained in Figure 4  that shows the \ntimings of the COT control in DCM. Inductor current (I L) \nis monitored with a zero- crossing detector and when I L \ncrosses the zero and goes slightly negative, both  \nhigh- side and low -side MOSFETs are turned off  (if V FB > \n0.575V). They  will not turn on again until the VFB falls \nbelow V REF and triggers a new on- time pulse. During \nthis off-time period, all non- essential circuits are shut  \ndown to minimize losses and the load is supplied by the output capacitor stored energy. The control circuitry \nwakes up when the new on-pulse is triggered.

Power -Save Mode (DCM)  \nReference Voltage  \nWith the 0. 575V internal precision reference voltage , it \nis possible to set the output voltage down to 0. 575V. \nThe accuracy of the internal reference is ± 2.5% at +25℃ \nand ± 3% across - 40℃ to +125℃ junction temperature . \nA resistor divider between the output voltage, V OUT \n(connected to the OUT input pin) and the FB pin, \nprograms the output voltage as given in the Equation 2: \n\uf8eb\uf8f6= ×+\uf8ec\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\uf8f81\nOUT REF\n2RVV1R           ( 2) \nwher e R 1 and R 2 are the upper and lower resistors of \nthe voltage divider between OUT  and GND  pins. \nCurrent limit  \nWhen an ov er-current  occurs on the output, it will be \nreflected on the SW node curr ent. If the current in the \nhigh-side switch exceeds its limit (almost 4 .5A), the \nhigh-side switch  will automatically  be turned  off and \nafter a short  dead- time, the low -side switch  will be \nturned on to take over the current in the inductor. If the \nlow-side switch current falls below 1.5A the current will \nbe considered normal and high- side switch will be  \nturned on again.  Output Over -Voltage Protection (OVP)  \nIf the sensed voltage on the FB pin exceeds 110% of the \nnominal value, it is considered an over -voltage event on \nthe output (V OUT_OV ) and the device goes into the \nover-voltage protection status.  \nUpon occurrence of an OVP, switching stops and both \nhigh-side and low -side switches remain off. Due to the \nexcellent sink and source capability of the synchronous \noutput stage, in most cases, the error amplifier will be \nable to maintain output in regulation and bring voltage \nback to normal . If a higher external voltage is accidently \nshorted to the converter output, an OVP event is triggered to protect the low -side switch. In any case, the \nregulator will automatically recover if the OVP f ault is \ncleared.  \nThermal Shutdown (TSD)  \nThe SGM61720 monitors junction temperature and will \nstop PWM switching if it becomes too hot . If the junction \ntemperature  exceeds +16 0℃ (TYP), the device is \nforced to stop switching. It will recover automatically when T\nJ the junction temperature decreases by \napproximately 30℃ . \nRipple Injection \nThe SGM61720 is a COT  control device in which the \nPWM timing is based on the output voltage ripple \nfeedback  to the FB pin. As explained before,  every time \nthe VFB voltage falls below VREF threshold,  the high- side \nswitch is turned on and the inductor current starts to rise. High-side switch is kept on for a constant on-time \nwhich is determined by V\nIN as explaine d in Equation 1. \nAt the end of on- time, the high- side switch is turned off \nand after a very short dead -time, the low -side switch is \nturned on (off -time) and current in the inductor starts to \ndecrease. The next on-time and current rise in the \ninductor start  when the V FB falls below V REF threshold \nagain. Therefore, in COT control the ripple initiates \neach cycle and there is no clock signal for switching.  \n  \nHigh Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  \nSGM 61720  Synchronous Buck  Converter  \n \n 12 MAY 2023 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  DETAILED DESCRIPTION (continued)  \nThe required V FB peak -to-peak ripple range for stable \nPWM operation is between 3 0mV to 2 00mV. At high \noutput voltage applications (typically V OUT  > 5V), the \nnatural output ripple is usually large enough for proper \nPWM operation because the output filter is usually \ndesigned such that the output ripple magnitude is \nroughly 1% to 2%  of the output voltage. However, in \nsome design conditions like low output voltage \napplications , such as a 1V, the output voltage ripple is \nusually low (e.g. 10mV) and it will not be possible to get \nenough in phase ripple on the FB pin without a new \nstrategy.  \nIn fact, the ripple feedback is even lower than output ripple due to the  voltage divider. If the FB ripple is small, \nthe internal amplifier and comparator are not able to \nsense that and the control will be lost. In such condition,  \nthe output voltage is either not regulated or has large \nripple due to missing or wrong multiple p ulses. With the \nlow ESR output capacitors such as ceramic ones, the ripple is also small. Therefore ripple injection methods \nare proposed for low output ripple applications to avoid \ninstability . \nRemember that naturally, the output ripple ( ∆V\nOUT) has \ntwo main components. One is in phase with inductor ripple and is produced by the inductor AC  current going \nthrough the output capacitors (V\nrr = ESR ⨯  ∆IL), and the \nother one that has a lag phase is due to the charge and discharge of capacitor by ∆I\nL current in each cycle \n(estimated by V cr ≈ ∆IL/8fsC). The output capacitor C is \nusually designed large enough to filter switching ripples such that ∆V\nOUT and output peak transients in r esponse \nto load changes, remain within the acceptable range in \nthe appl ication. Too large output capacitor may result in \nstartup issues.  \nThree main cases can be classified based on the \namount of peak -to-peak feedback ripple ( ΔVFB) and the \nripple injection technique used for COT converters.  \nCase1: If the output capacitor has  large ESR, the \noutput ripple at the FB  pin is mainly due to the ESR that \ncarries the inductor current ripple (see  Figure 5). If the \noutput voltage is small (R 2 is large compared to R 1) the \nripples seen by FB pin are large enough and with \nproper phase. In this case converter has a stable \noperation without any rippl e injection. The stability \ncriterion is:  <× ×ON OUT t 2 ESR C                (3) \nThe feedback voltage ripple is given by Equation 4: \n≈ ××2\nFB L\n12RΔV ESR ΔIR  + R            (4) \nwhere:  \nΔIL = peak-to-peak value of the inductor current ripple . \nSGM 61720L\nSW\nFBR1\nR2 ESRCOUT\n \nFigure 5. Feedback C ircuit when Enough Ripple at FB  Pin \n \nCase 2: In this case,  the in- phase ripple of the output is \nlarge enough, but it is weakened by the resistor divider \n(R2 is large compared to R 1). As shown in Figure 6, a \nsmall  feed- forward capacitor (C FF), across the upper \nresistor (R 1) bypasses the resistor divider at the ripple \nfrequency (f S) and the ripple seen on the FB pin is \nessentially the same as th e output voltage ripple (not \nweakened by the divider).  The other advantage of \nusing C FF is the improvement of the converter transient \nresponse, because feeding back the actual over/under - \nvoltage transients of the output with no weakening helps a quicker reaction and faster response to transients. In fact, it is someti mes used for applications \nlike Case 1 for better transient response. However, the \ndrawback of C\nFF is that it may worsen the regulation of \nthe converter output. Typically, the CFF value is cho sen \nbetween 1nF and 100nF (the impedance is typically a few ohms to a few hundred ohms).  \nSGM 61720L\nSW\nFBR1\nR2 ESRCOUT CFF\n \nFigure 6.

Also, the time constant seen by C FF \nshould be much longer than switching period, that is \n((R1||R2) × CFF≫1\nfS). \nCase 3 : In modern designs , ceramic capacitors are \nextensively used due to their small size and good stability. Due to very low ESR of the output  capacitors , \nthere is virtually no r ipple at the FB pin. This is usually \nmore critical at low output voltage in which lower output \nripple is required (typically less than 20mV).  Therefore,  \nadditional ripple (in phase with inductor current) needs to be injected artificially into the FB pin to  keep stable \nswitching. The additional ripple can be injected from the \nswitching  SW node by a series resistor (R\nINJ) and \ncapacitor (C INJ), as shown in Figure 7. \nSGM61720SW\nFBR1\nR2 ESRCOUT CFFRINJCINJL\n \nFigure 7. Ripple Injection from SW Pin  \n \nNote that if too much ripple is injected, the transient \nresponse will get worse, because the impact of the actual output variations on the feedback signal is reduced. The key point is that the ripple  should be kept \nas small as possible without losing the stability. It is recommended to keep  ΔV\nFB between 30mV to 2 00mV . \nThe process of sizing the ripple injection resistor and capacitors in Figure 7 is as follows:  \n• Select C\nFF to feed all output ripples into the feedback \npin. The impedance of C FF should be small compared \nto the feedback divider impedance at the desired \nswitching frequency . The impedance of the feedback \nnetwork is the parallel combination of R1||R2. The \nimpedance of C FF at the switching frequency can be \ntaken to be about one tenth of this value.  \n×\nπ12\nFF\nS1210 (R +R )C  = 2 f RR                 (6) \n• Select R INJ. When SW voltage is equal to V IN, the \ncurrent injected in the feed- forward capacitor C FF is \ncalculated as (V IN-VOUT)/RINJ, neglecting the DC \nresistance of inductor and the small amount of current \nflowing through R 1 and R 2. Given an injected voltage \nripple  ΔVFB into the f eedback node, R INJ can be \ncalculated as:  \n−×∆ON IN OUT\nINJ\nFF FBt VVR  = CV              (7) \n• Select C INJ as DC blocking capacitor which should be \n3 to 4 times larger than the C FF. \n4= ×INJ FF CC                    (8) \n \n  \nHigh Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  \nSGM 61720  Synchronous Buck  Converter  \n \n 14 MAY 2023 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION  \nSetting the Output Voltage  \nThe output voltage of the regulator is determined by an \nexternal resistor  divider  from the output node  to the FB \npin as shown in  Figure 8. It is recommended to use  \nresistors with 1% tolerance or better  because it directly \naffects the output accuracy . The recommended range \nfor selection of R 1 is between 10kΩ to 100kΩ . Note that  \nthe R1 value  larger than 400kΩ  is not recommended , \nbecause it makes the feedback path more susceptible \nto noise. To avoid the noise too large to disturb the VFB, \nthe R 2 must less than 50k Ω. \n\uf8eb\uf8f6= × \uf8ec\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\uf8f81\nOUT\n2RV 0.575 1+R             (9) \nSGM 61720\nR1\nR2VOUT\nFB\nGND\n \nFigure 8. Setting the Output Voltage  \n \nOutput Inductor (L)  \nFour parameters of the inductor should be considered \nin the design:  nominal i nduct ance value, DC resistance, \nsaturation current  and maximum RMS  current . \nA good compromise among size, loss, and cost is to set \nthe inductor ripple current to be equal to 40% of the \nmaximum output current.  \n( ) ×−\n=× ××OUT IN(MAX) OUT\nOUT(MAX) S IN(MAX)VV V\nL0.4 I f V         (10)  \nThe peak inductor current  is equal to the average  \noutput current plus one  half of the peak -to-peak  \ninductor current ripple.  \n= + ×∆L(PK) OUT(MAX) L(PP) I I 0.5 I         ( 11) \nThe input and output voltages and the inductance of the \ninductor  determine the peak -to-peak inductor  current  \nripple (given by Equation 12). \n( ) ×−\n∆=××OUT IN(MAX) OUT\nL(PP)\nS IN(MAX)VV V\nILf V         (12) \nwhere:  \nΔIL(PP) = peak-to-peak inductor current  ripple.  \nfS = switching frequency . Larger  peak -to-peak current ripple increases the power  \ndissipation in the inductor and MOSFETs.  Larger  output \ncurrent  ripple  also requires more output  capacitance to \nsmooth out the larger current ripple.  Smaller peak -to- \npeak current ripple requires a larger  inductance value \nand therefore a larger and more expensive inductor.  \nOutput Capacitors  \nThe output capacitors and inductor filter the AC part of \nthe PWM switching voltage and provide an acceptable \nlevel of output voltage ripple superimposed on the \ndesired output DC voltage. Capacitors also store \nenergy to help maintaining of the output voltage \nregulation during a load transient. The output voltage \nripple (ΔV OUT) depends on the output capacitor  value at \nthe operating voltage and temperature ( ℃) and its \nparasitics (ESR and ESL):  \n− ∆∆ = ∆× + × +IN OUT L\nOUT L\nSVV IV I ESR ESLL 8f C     (13) \nThe voltage rating of the output capacitors should be \nselected with enough margins  to ensure that \ncapacitance drop (voltage and temperature derating) is not significant. The type of output capacitors will \ndetermine which terms of Equation 13 are dominant. \nFor ceramic output capacitors, the ESR and ESL are \nvirtually zero so the output voltage ripple will be \ndominated by the capacitive term.  \n∆∆≈L\nOUT\nSIV8f C                (14) \nTo reduce the voltage ripple either switching frequency \nor the total capacitance is increased. Inductance may \nalso be increased to reduce the inductor current ripple. \nFor electrolytic output capacitors, the value of \ncapacitance is relatively high, and the third term in Equation 13 can be ignored compared to the ESR and \nESL terms:  \n−∆ = ∆× + ×IN OUT\nOUT LVVV I ESR ESLL      (15) \n \nHigh Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  \nSGM 61720  Synchronous Buck  Converter  \n \n 15 MAY 2023 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  \nHigher quality capacitors, larger inductance or using \nparal lel capacitors can help reduce  the output ripple in \na design using electrolytic output capacitors. The ESR \nof some commercial electrolytic capacitors can be quite \nhigh, and it is recommended to use quality capacitors \nwith the ESR or the total impedance clearly \ndocumented in their datas heet. ESR of an electrolytic \ncapacitor may increase significantly at cold ambient \ntemperatures with a factor of 10 or so, which increases \nthe ripple and can deteriorate the regulator stability.  \nThe transient response of the regulator also depends \non the quantity and type of output capacitors. In general, \nreducing the ESR of the output capacitance will result \nin a better transient response. The ESR can be \nminimized by simply adding more capacitors in parallel \nor by using higher quality capacitors. When a fas t load \ntransient of magnitude ∆I and rate of di/dt occurs, the \noutput voltage will jump or dip by a transient magnitude \nof ∆VOUT: \n∆ ∆× + ×OUTdiV = I ESR ESLdt          (16) \nRight  after the transient , the inductor current remains \nalmost constant especially for larger inductors and the \ntransient current is carried by the capacitor. The output \nvoltage will deviate from its nominal value for a short \ntime depending on the system bandwidth, the inductor \nand the output capacitance. Eventually, the error \namplifier and feedback bring the output voltage back to \nits nominal value. A higher bandwidth is usually \npreferred to get shorter settling time;  however, it may \nbe more difficult to get acceptable gain and phase margins.  \n \nInput Capacitors  \nFour parameters of the i nput capacitors  should be \nconsidered in the design:  capacitance value, ESR, \ncurrent rating and voltage rating.  The capacitance \nvalue should be large enough and ESR must be small \nenough to limit the input voltage ripples much less than \nthe hysteresis of the input  for UVLO (V UVLO_ HYS). This value is nominally 700mV for the SGM61720. The \nworst case occurs at full load and minimum input voltage. The C\nIN voltage rating should have adequate \ndesign margin to handle the highest expected input \nsurge voltage. Also, the capacitance drop (derating) at maximum operating voltage and the worst ambient \ntemperature must be considered for the design. Finally, \nthe capacitor RMS current rating must be higher than \nthe expected RMS input current to the regulator with \nthe temperature derating considerations. Note that the \ninput current has two main AC  components that both \nshould circulate in the input capacitor and only the DC \ncomponent of regulator input must be taken from the \nsource. The AC current in the input capacitor includes a \nhigh frequency component caused by switching \ntransi ents (due to the hard switching and gate driving) \nand a main AC  component caused by the inductor \nripple at the switching frequency. To decouple these two currents, typically the two capacitor types should \nbe paralleled.  Small low -ESR ceramic capacitor  is used \nright beside the IN and GND pins  of the regulator to \ncarry the high frequency switching transients (ringings) \nand larger capacitor  is paralleled to carry the inductor \nripple and load transient currents to minimize the input \nvoltage ripple. The input capacitors must deliver the \nRMS current according to:  \nRMS OI I D (1 D)= ×−                ( 17) \nwhere the duty cycle is D ≈ V OUT/VIN. For example, at D  \n= 20% duty cycle, the input/output current multiplier is \n0.40. Therefore, if the regulator is delivering 3 A of \nsteady -state load current, the input capacitor(s) must \nsupport a n RMS  current of 1.2A (0.40 × 3 A). \n \n  \n \n  \nHigh Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  \nSGM 61720  Synchronous Buck  Converter  \n \n 16 MAY 2023 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  APPLICATION INFORMATION (continued)  \nThe input capacitor(s) must limit the voltage deviations \nat the IN pin to something significantly less than the \nUVLO hysteresis during maximum load and minimum \ninput voltage. Considering a conservative factor of 0.83 \nfor frequency deviation, the minimum input capacitance \ncan be calculated as f ollows:  \n××−×\n×∆OUT\nIN\nS IN(MIN)I D(1D)C >1.2\nfV           (18) \nwhere ΔV IN(MIN)  is chosen to be much less than the \nhysteresis of the V IN UVLO comparator (ΔV IN(MIN)  ≤ \n150mV is recommended), and f S is the nominal PWM \nfrequency. The D × (1 - D) term in Equation 18 has an \nabsolute maximum value of 0.25 at 50% duty cycle. So, \nfor example, a very conservative design based on I OUT \n= 2A, and V OUT = 5V (f S = 316kHz), D × (1 - D) = 0.25, \nand ΔV IN = 150mV.  \n×≥×\n×IN2A 0.25C 1.2 =12.7 F\n316kHz 150mVμ        (19) \nAs discussed before,  DC bias effect (voltage derating) \non the ceramic capacitors needs to  be considered.  The \ncapacitance drop with voltage is huge with the Y5V and Z5U temperature characteristic ceramic capacitors (as \nmuch as 90% reduction) and these types should be \navoided. The X5R and X7R type capacitors are the \nprimary choices due to their stability against DC bias \nand temperature. The DC bias drop effect is larger for \nsmaller physical capacitor sizes, however , the \nself-resonance frequency of larger package capacitors \nis ty pically lower, so a compromise is needed. \nSelf-resonance frequency of the capacitor should be \nhigher than the expected operating f requency range of \nthe capacitor . Beyond  the resonant, the impedance of \nthe capacitor will be more inductive rather than \ncapaci tive. Self -resonance of the HF decoupling input \ncapacitors must be higher than the converter switching \nnoise and ringing frequency. It can be several times \nhigher than switching frequency.  For this design, two \n10uF capacitors are used for the input decoupl ing. To \nimprove high frequency filtering, a small parallel 0.22uF capacitor is recommended to plac e as close as \npossible to IN pin.  \n \n  \nHigh Efficiency, 2.5A, 60V Input  \nSGM 61720  Synchronous Buck  Converter  \n \n 17 MAY 2023 \n SG Micro Corp \nwww.sg -micro.com  LAYOUT GUIDE  \nThe PCB layout is quite important in the power supply \ndesign. An incorrect layout could cause many problems, \nsuch as instability, load and line transient regulation \nproblems, output voltage noise, and EMI issues. Good \ngrounding becomes important , especially with heavy \nload current.  \nThe following PCB l ayout guide should be applied:  \n1. Use short , wide and direct traces for high- current \nconnections ( IN, SW and GND).  \n2. Traces of  switching node ( SW) should be short and \naway from feedback network traces.  3. Keep the BS voltage path as short as possible.  \n4. Place  decoupling capacitors close to the IN and GND \npins.  \n5. If a bulk capacitor is used  at output , add an additional  \n1µF ceramic capacitor  or larger value as close as \npossible to the OUT  and GND pins.  \n6. Decoupling capacitors  should be as close as possible  \nto the LDO and GND pins.  \n7. Place the feedback resistors  as close  as possible to \nthe FB pin that is sensitive to noise.  \n \nFigure 9.
