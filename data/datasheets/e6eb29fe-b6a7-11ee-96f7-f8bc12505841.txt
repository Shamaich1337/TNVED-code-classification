[{'role': 'system', 'content': 'You are a technical specialist with expertise in electronics. Your task is to analyze datasheets for electronic components and provide a concise summary of the product’s key characteristics and specifications. In addition, you need to gather textual information about the component, including its description and typical applications.Instructions:    Identify the correct component in the datasheet using the provided product code.    Summarize key parameters, including:        Voltage ratings        Current ratings        Power consumption        Operating temperature range        Package type        Special features or notes (if applicable)        Moisture Sensetive Level JEDEC J-STD-020E    Provide a short description of the component, including what it is (e.g., transistor, microcontroller, sensor) and its primary function.    Explain typical applications for the component (e.g., power management, signal processing, data storage, etc.).    Be thorough and accurate: Ensure the information corresponds specifically to the product code, as some datasheets cover multiple variants.Your goal is to create a clear and accurate technical summary that includes both key specifications and a description of what the component is used for.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': "Give me information about the component of ERB-RD1R00X production of PANASONIC INDUSTRIAL from the text:Micro Chip Fuse\nMicro Chip Fuse\nType: ERB RD\nERB RE\nERB RG\n●Small size\n●Fast-acting and withstanding in-rush current characteristics\n●RoHS compliant\nUL248-14 : File No.E194052\nc-UL C22.2 No.248-14 : File No.E194052\n(1.0 mm×0.5 mm)\n(1.6 mm×0.8 mm)\n(3.2 mm×1.6 mm)\n0.30±0.15 0.54±0.10+0.15\n-0.052.0AERBRD\n0.30±0.20Explanation of Part NumbersApproved Safety Standards\nDimensions in mm (not to scale)Product Code\nMicro Chip FuseStructure\nRectangular\ntypeRRated Current(A)\n1R40 1.4A\n3.15A1.5AProduct shape\n0402 inch size\n1.25AXPressed Carrier Taping\n2 mm pitch, 10,000 pcs\nL WVPunched Carrier Taping\n4mm pitch,  5,000 pcs1R50\n5R00\nPart No.\n(inch size)5.0A0.375A 2R00\n0.50AE\nG0603 inch size\n1206 inch sizeFeatures\nD\nDesign and specifications are each subject to change without notice.

In salty air or in air with a high concentration of corrosive gas, such as Cl 2，H 2S，NH 3，SO 2，or NO X .\n2. In direct sunlight.\n(3) Precaution specific to this product\n1. Set the rated current so that the current passing through the Micro Chip Fuses (hereafter called the  fuses)\nunder normal conditions is within 70% of the rated current.\n2. Do not continuously pass a current exceeding the rated current through the fuses.\n3. If a pulse exceeding the rated current is applied, such as a rush current or surge current at power-on, \ntake care not to cause unwanted fusing. Calculate the I2t value of the pulse and check the tolerance to\nthe number of pulses according to the I2t-t characteristic curve before deciding to use the fuses.\nBefore checking the tolerance, consult our sales staff in advance.\n4. The fuses are designed to be blown out by a current that is double or greater than the rated current. \nEnsure that the abnormal current generated when a circuit abnormality occurs in your product is at least \ndouble or greater than the rated current of the fuses. In addition, ensure that the abnormal current of \nyour product does not exceed the maximum interrupting current of the fuses.\n5. The fuses are designed to be used on the secondary side of a power supply. Do not use them on the \nprimary side.\n6. Ensure that the voltage applied to the fuses are within their rated voltage.\n7. The fusing characteristics of the fuses are affected by the ambient temperature. Before use, mount the \nfuses on your products and carefully check and evaluate their category temperature range.\n＜Package markings＞\nPackage markings include the product number, quantity, and country of origin.\nIn principle, the country of origin should be indicated in English.\n1-Oct-19\n\nMouser Electronics\n  \nAuthorized Distributor\n \n  \nClick to View Pricing, Inventory, Delivery & Lifecycle Information:\n \n \n \n Panasonic:   \n\xa0 ERB-RD0R50X\xa0 ERB-RE1R50V\xa0 ERB-RE1R00V\xa0 ERB-RD0R75X\xa0 ERB-RE1R25V\xa0 ERB-RE0R75V\xa0 ERB-RE0R50V\xa0\nERB-RD2R50X\xa0 ERB-RD2R00X\xa0 ERB-RD1R50X\xa0 ERB-RD3R00X\xa0 ERB-RD1R00X\xa0 ERB-RE2R00V\xa0 ERB-RE2R50V\xa0\nERB-RE3R00V\xa0 ERB-RE4R00V\xa0 ERB-RE5R00V\xa0 ERB-RD1R25X\xa0 ERB-RG2R50V\xa0 ERB-RG1R25V\xa0 ERB-RG4R00V\xa0\nERB-RG0R50V\xa0 ERB-RG1R50V\xa0 ERB-RG0R75V\xa0 ERB-RG1R00V\xa0 ERB-RG3R00V\xa0 ERB-RG2R00V\xa0 ERB-RE1R40V\xa0\nERB-RE3R15V\xa0 ERB-RD5R00X\xa0 ERB-RD0R63X\xa0 ERB-RD4R00X\n"}]
