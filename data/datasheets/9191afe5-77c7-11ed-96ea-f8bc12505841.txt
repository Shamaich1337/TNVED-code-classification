This feature greatly simplifies the design of switch-mode power supplies.\nOther features include a ±4% tolerance on output voltage under specified input voltage and output load\nconditions, and ±15% on the oscillator frequency. External shutdown is included, featuring typically 80 μA\nstandby current. Self-protection features include a two stage frequency reducing current limit for the output\nswitch and an overtemperature shutdown for complete protection under fault conditions.www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 3\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\n6 Pin Configuration and Functions\nFigure 6-1. 5-Pin TO-220 NDH Package Top View\nFigure 6-2. 5-Pin TO-263 KTT Package Top View\nTable 6-1. Pin Functions\nPIN\nI/O DESCRIPTION\nNO. NAME\n1 VIN IThis is the positive input supply for the IC switching regulator. A suitable input bypass\ncapacitor must be present at this pin to minimize voltage transients and to supply the\nswitching currents required by the regulator.\n2 Output OInternal switch. The voltage at this pin switches between approximately (+V IN − V SAT) and\napproximately −0.5 V, with a duty cycle of V OUT / VIN. To minimize coupling to sensitive\ncircuitry, the PCB copper area connected to this pin must be kept to a minimum.\n3 Ground — Circuit ground\n4 Feedback I Senses the regulated output voltage to complete the feedback loop.\n5 ON/OFF IAllows the switching regulator circuit to be shut down using logic signals thus dropping\nthe total input supply current to approximately 80 µA. Pulling this pin below a threshold\nvoltage of approximately 1.3 V turns the regulator on, and pulling this pin above 1.3 V (up\nto a maximum of 25 V) shuts the regulator down. If this shutdown feature is not required,\nthe ON/OFF pin can be wired to the ground pin or it can be left open. In either case, the\nregulator will be in the ON condition.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n4 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\n7 Specifications\n7.1 Absolute Maximum Ratings\nover operating free-air temperature range (unless otherwise noted)(1) (2)\nMIN MAX UNIT\nMaximum supply voltage (V IN) 45 V\nSD/SS pin input voltage(3)6 V\nDelay pin voltage(3)1.5 V\nFlag pin voltage –0.3 45 V\nFeedback pin voltage –0.3 25 V\nOutput voltage to ground, steady-state –1 V\nPower dissipation Internally limited\nLead temperatureKTW packageVapor phase (60 s) 215\n°C Infrared (10 s) 245\nNDZ package, soldering (10 s) 260\nMaximum junction temperature 150 °C\nStorage temperature, T stg –65 150 °C\n(1) Stresses beyond those listed under Absolute Maximum Ratings  may cause permanent damage to the device.

The regulator is capable of delivering up to 3-A DC load current\nwith excellent line and load regulation. These devices are available in fixed output voltages of 3.3-V, 5-V, 12-V,\nand an adjustable output version. The family requires few external components, and the pin arrangement was\ndesigned for simple, optimum PCB layout.\n8.2 Functional Block Diagram\n8.3 Feature Description\n8.3.1 Delayed Start-Up\nThe circuit in Figure 8-1  uses the ON/OFF pin to provide a time delay between the time the input voltage is\napplied and the time the output voltage comes up (only the circuitry pertaining to the delayed start-up is shown).\nAs the input voltage rises, the charging of capacitor C1 pulls the ON/OFF pin high, keeping the regulator OFF.\nOnce the input voltage reaches its final value and the capacitor stops charging, resistor R 2 pulls the ON/OFF\npin low, thus allowing the circuit to start switching. Resistor R 1 is included to limit the maximum voltage applied\nto the ON/OFF pin (maximum of 25 V), reduces power supply noise sensitivity, and also limits the capacitor\nC1 discharge current. When high input ripple voltage exists, avoid long delay time, because this ripple can be\ncoupled into the ON/OFF pin and cause problems.\nThis delayed start-up feature is useful in situations where the input power source is limited in the amount of\ncurrent it can deliver. It allows the input voltage to rise to a higher voltage before the regulator starts operating.\nBuck regulators require less input current at higher input voltages.www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nFigure 8-1. Delayed Start-Up\n8.3.2 Undervoltage Lockout\nSome applications require the regulator to remain off until the input voltage reaches a predetermined voltage.\nFigure 8-2  shows an undervoltage lockout feature applied to a buck regulator, while Figure 8-3  and Figure 8-4\napply the same feature to an inverting circuit. The circuit in Figure 8-3  features a constant threshold voltage for\nturnon and turnoff (Zener voltage plus approximately one volt). If hysteresis is required, the circuit in Figure 8-4\nhas a turnon voltage which is different than the turnoff voltage. The amount of hysteresis is approximately equal\nto the value of the output voltage. If Zener voltages greater than 25 V are used, an additional 47-k Ω resistor is\nrequired from the ON/OFF pin to the ground pin to stay within the 25 V maximum limit of the ON/OFF pin.\nFigure 8-2. Undervoltage Lockout for Buck Regulator\n8.3.3 Inverting Regulator\nThe circuit in Figure 8-5  converts a positive input voltage to a negative output voltage with a common ground.\nThe circuit operates by bootstrapping the ground pin of the regulator to the negative output voltage, then\ngrounding the feedback pin, the regulator senses the inverted output voltage and regulates it.\nThis circuit has an ON/OFF threshold of approximately 13 V.\nFigure 8-3. Undervoltage Lockout for Inverting Regulator\nThis example uses the LM2596-5.0 to generate a −5-V output, but other output voltages are possible by\nselecting other output voltage versions, including the adjustable version. Because this regulator topology can\nproduce an output voltage that is either greater than or less than the input voltage, the maximum output current\ngreatly depends on both the input and output voltage. Figure 8-6  provides a guide as to the amount of output\nload current possible for the different input and output voltage conditions.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nThe maximum voltage appearing across the regulator is the absolute sum of the input and output voltage, and\nthis must be limited to a maximum of 40 V. For example, when converting +20 V to −12 V, the regulator would\nsee 32 V between the input pin and ground pin. The LM2596 has a maximum input voltage spec of 40 V.\nAdditional diodes are required in this regulator configuration. Diode D1 is used to isolate input voltage ripple\nor noise from coupling through the C IN capacitor to the output, under light or no load conditions. Also, this\ndiode isolation changes the topology to closely resemble a buck configuration, thus providing good closed-loop\nstability. TI recommends using a Schottky diode for low input voltages, (because of its lower voltage drop) but for\nhigher input voltages, a fast recovery diode could be used.\nWithout diode D3, when the input voltage is first applied, the charging current of C IN can pull the output positive\nby several volts for a short period of time. Adding D3 prevents the output from going positive by more than a\ndiode voltage.\nThis circuit has hysteresis Regulator starts switching at V IN = 13 V Regulator stops switching at V IN = 8 V\nFigure 8-4.

Inverting Regulator Typical Load Current\nBecause of differences in the operation of the inverting regulator, the standard design procedure is not used\nto select the inductor value. In the majority of designs, a 33- μH, 3.5-A inductor is the best choice. Capacitorwww.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nselection can also be narrowed down to just a few values. Using the values shown in Figure 8-5  will provide\ngood results in the majority of inverting designs.\nThis type of inverting regulator can require relatively large amounts of input current when starting up, even with\nlight loads. Input currents as high as the LM2596 current limit (approximately 4.5 A) are required for at least 2\nms or more, until the output reaches its nominal output voltage. The actual time depends on the output voltage\nand the size of the output capacitor. Input power sources that are current limited or sources that can not deliver\nthese currents without getting loaded down, may not work correctly. Because of the relatively high start-up\ncurrents required by the inverting topology, the delayed start-up feature (C1, R 1, and R 2) shown in Figure 8-5  is\nrecommended. By delaying the regulator start-up, the input capacitor is allowed to charge up to a higher voltage\nbefore the switcher begins operating. A portion of the high input current required for start-up is now supplied\nby the input capacitor (C IN). For severe start-up conditions, the input capacitor can be made much larger than\nnormal.\n8.3.4 Inverting Regulator Shutdown Methods\nUsing the ON/OFF pin in a standard buck configuration is simple. To turn the regulator ON, pull the ON/OFF pin\nbelow 1.3 V (at 25°C, referenced to ground). To turn the regulator OFF, pull the ON/OFF pin above 1.3 V. With\nthe inverting configuration, some level shifting is required, because the ground pin of the regulator is no longer\nat ground, but is now setting at the negative output voltage level. Two different shutdown methods for inverting\nregulators are shown in Figure 8-7  and Figure 8-8 .\nFigure 8-7. Inverting Regulator Ground Referenced Shutdown\nFigure 8-8. Inverting Regulator Ground Referenced Shutdown Using Opto Device\n8.4 Device Functional Modes\n8.4.1 Discontinuous Mode Operation\nThe selection guide chooses inductor values suitable for continuous mode operation, but for low current\napplications or high input voltages, a discontinuous mode design can be a better choice. A discontinuous mode\ndesign would use an inductor that would be physically smaller, and would require only one half to one third the\ninductance value required for a continuous mode design. The peak switch and inductor currents will be higher in\na discontinuous design, but at these low load currents (1 A and below), the maximum switch current will still be\nless than the switch current limit.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nDiscontinuous operation can have voltage waveforms that are considerably different than a continuous design.\nThe output pin (switch) waveform can have some damped sinusoidal ringing present (see Figure 9-14 ). This\nringing is normal for discontinuous operation, and is not caused by feedback loop instabilities. In discontinuous\noperation, there is a period of time where neither the switch nor the diode are conducting, and the inductor\ncurrent has dropped to zero. During this time, a small amount of energy can circulate between the inductor and\nthe switch/diode parasitic capacitance causing this characteristic ringing. Normally this ringing is not a problem,\nunless the amplitude becomes great enough to exceed the input voltage, and even then, there is very little\nenergy present to cause damage.\nDifferent inductor types or core materials produce different amounts of this characteristic ringing. Ferrite core\ninductors have very little core loss and therefore produce the most ringing. The higher core loss of powdered iron\ninductors produce less ringing. If desired, a series RC could be placed in parallel with the inductor to dampen the\nringing.\nFigure 8-9.

TI’s customers are responsible for\ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design\nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\n9.1.1 Input Capacitor (C IN)\nA low ESR aluminum or tantalum bypass capacitor is required between the input pin and ground pin. It must be\nplaced near the regulator using short leads. This capacitor prevents large voltage transients from occuring at the\ninput, and provides the instantaneous current required each time the switch turns ON.\nThe important parameters for the input capacitor are the voltage rating and the RMS current rating. Because of\nthe relatively high RMS currents flowing in a input capacitor of the buck converter, this capacitor must be chosen\nfor its RMS current rating rather than its capacitance or voltage ratings, although the capacitance value and\nvoltage rating are directly related to the RMS current rating.\nThe RMS current rating of a capacitor could be viewed as a power rating of the capacitor. The RMS current\nflowing through the capacitors internal ESR produces power which causes the internal temperature of the\ncapacitor to rise. The RMS current rating of a capacitor is determined by the amount of current required to\nraise the internal temperature approximately 10°C above an ambient temperature of 105°C. The ability of the\ncapacitor to dissipate this heat to the surrounding air will determine the amount of current the capacitor can\nsafely sustain. For a given capacitor value, a higher voltage electrolytic capacitor is physically larger than a lower\nvoltage capacitor, and thus be able to dissipate more heat to the surrounding air, and therefore will have a higher\nRMS current rating.\nThe consequences of operating an electrolytic capacitor above the RMS current rating is a shortened operating\nlife. The higher temperature speeds up the evaporation of the capacitor\'s electrolyte, resulting in eventual failure.\nSelecting an input capacitor requires consulting the manufacturers data sheet for maximum allowable RMS\nripple current. For a maximum ambient temperature of 40°C, a general guideline would be to select a capacitor\nwith a ripple current rating of approximately 50% of the DC load current. For ambient temperatures up to 70°C,\na current rating of 75% of the DC load current would be a good choice for a conservative design. The capacitor\nvoltage rating must be at least 1.25 times greater than the maximum input voltage, and often a much higher\nvoltage capacitor is required to satisfy the RMS current requirements.\nFigure 9-1  shows the relationship between an electrolytic capacitor value, its voltage rating, and the RMS current\nit is rated for. These curves were obtained from the Nichicon PL series of low-ESR, high-reliability electrolytic\ncapacitors designed for switching regulator applications. Other capacitor manufacturers offer similar types of\ncapacitors, but always check the capacitor data sheet.\nStandard  electrolytic capacitors typically have much higher ESR numbers, lower RMS current ratings and\ntypically have a shorter operating lifetime.\nBecause of their small size and excellent performance, surface-mount solid tantalum capacitors are often used\nfor input bypassing, but several precautions must be observed. A small percentage of solid tantalum capacitors\ncan short if the inrush current rating is exceeded. This can happen at turnon when the input voltage is suddenly\napplied, and of course, higher input voltages produce higher inrush currents. Several capacitor manufacturers\ndo a 100% surge current testing on their products to minimize this potential problem. If high turnon currents are\nexpected, it may be necessary to limit this current by adding either some resistance or inductance before the\ntantalum capacitor, or select a higher voltage capacitor. As with aluminum electrolytic capacitors, the RMS ripple\ncurrent rating must be sized to the load current.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\n9.1.2 Feedforward Capacitor (C FF)\nNote\nFor adjustable output voltage version only.\nA feedforward capacitor, shown across R2 in Table 9-6 , is used when the output voltage is greater than 10 V or\nwhen C OUT has a very low ESR. This capacitor adds lead compensation to the feedback loop and increases the\nphase margin for better loop stability. For C FF selection, see the Section 9.2.2.2  section.\nFigure 9-1. RMS Current Ratings for Low ESR Electrolytic Capacitors (Typical)\n9.1.3 Output Capacitor (C OUT)\nAn output capacitor is required to filter the output and provide regulator loop stability. Low impedance or low-\nESR electrolytic or solid tantalum capacitors designed for switching regulator applications must be used. When\nselecting an output capacitor, the important capacitor parameters are the 100-kHz ESR, the RMS ripple current\nrating, voltage rating, and capacitance value. For the output capacitor, the ESR value is the most important\nparameter.\nThe output capacitor requires an ESR value that has an upper and lower limit. For low output ripple voltage, a\nlow ESR value is required. This value is determined by the maximum allowable output ripple voltage, typically\n1% to 2% of the output voltage. But if the selected capacitor\'s ESR is extremely low, there is a possibility of\nan unstable feedback loop, resulting in an oscillation at the output. Using the capacitors listed in the tables, or\nsimilar types, will provide design solutions under all conditions.\nIf very low output ripple voltage (less than 15 mV) is required, see Section 9.1.6  for a post ripple filter.\nAn ESR value of the aluminum electrolytic capacitor is related to the capacitance value and its voltage rating.\nIn most cases, higher voltage electrolytic capacitors have lower ESR values (see Figure 9-2 ). Often, capacitors\nwith much higher voltage ratings may be required to provide the low ESR values required for low output ripple\nvoltage.\nThe output capacitor for many different switcher designs often can be satisfied with only three or four different\ncapacitor values and several different voltage ratings. See Table 9-3  and Table 9-4  for typical capacitor values,\nvoltage ratings, and manufacturers capacitor types.\nElectrolytic capacitors are not recommended for temperatures below −25°C. The ESR rises dramatically at cold\ntemperatures and is typically three times as large at −25°C and as much as 10 times as large at −40°C. See\nFigure 9-3 .\nSolid tantalum capacitors have a much better ESR specifications for cold temperatures and are recommended\nfor temperatures below −25°C.www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nFigure 9-2. Capacitor ESR versus Capacitor Voltage Rating (Typical Low-ESR Electrolytic Capacitor)\n9.1.4 Catch Diode\nBuck regulators require a diode to provide a return path for the inductor current when the switch turns off. This\nmust be a fast diode and must be placed close to the LM2596 using short leads and short printed-circuit traces.\nBecause of their very fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop, Schottky diodes provide the best\nperformance, especially in low output voltage applications (5 V and lower). Ultra-fast recovery, or high-efficiency\nrectifiers are also a good choice, but some types with an abrupt turnoff characteristic may cause instability or\nEMI problems. Ultra-fast recovery diodes typically have reverse recovery times of 50 ns or less. Rectifiers such\nas the 1N5400 series are much too slow and should not be used.\nFigure 9-3. Capacitor ESR Change versus Temperature\n9.1.5 Inductor Selection\nAll switching regulators have two basic modes of operation; continuous and discontinuous. The difference\nbetween the two types relates to the inductor current, whether it is flowing continuously, or if it drops to zero for a\nperiod of time in the normal switching cycle. Each mode has distinctively different operating characteristics,\nwhich can affect the regulators performance and requirements. Most switcher designs will operate in the\ndiscontinuous mode when the load current is low.\nThe LM2596 (or any of the SIMPLE SWITCHER family) can be used for both continuous or discontinuous\nmodes of operation.\nIn many cases the preferred mode of operation is the continuous mode, which offers greater output power,\nlower peak switch, lower inductor and diode currents, and can have lower output ripple voltage. However, the\ncontinuous mode does require larger inductor values to keep the inductor current flowing continuously, especially\nat low output load currents or high input voltages.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nTo simplify the inductor selection process, an inductor selection guide (nomograph) was designed (see Figure\n9-5 through Figure 9-8 ). This guide assumes that the regulator is operating in the continuous mode, and selects\nan inductor that will allow a peak-to-peak inductor ripple current to be a certain percentage of the maximum\ndesign load current. This peak-to-peak inductor ripple current percentage is not fixed, but is allowed to change\nas different design load currents are selected (see Figure 9-4 .)\nFigure 9-4. (ΔI IND) Peak-to-Peak Inductor Ripple Current (as a Percentage of the Load Current) versus\nLoad Current\nBy allowing the percentage of inductor ripple current to increase for low load currents, the inductor value and\nsize can be kept relatively low.\nWhen operating in the continuous mode, the inductor current waveform ranges from a triangular to a sawtooth\ntype of waveform (depending on the input voltage), with the average value of this current waveform equal to the\nDC output load current.\nInductors are available in different styles such as pot core, toroid, E-core, bobbin core, and so forth, as well\nas different core materials, such as ferrites and powdered iron. The least expensive, the bobbin, rod or stick\ncore, consists of wire wound on a ferrite bobbin. This type of construction makes for an inexpensive inductor,\nbut because the magnetic flux is not completely contained within the core, it generates more Electro-Magnetic\nInterference (EMl). This magnetic flux can induce voltages into nearby printed-circuit traces, thus causing\nproblems with both the switching regulator operation and nearby sensitive circuitry, and can give incorrect scope\nreadings because of induced voltages in the scope probe (see Section 9.1.7 ).\nWhen multiple switching regulators are located on the same PCB, open-core magnetics can cause interference\nbetween two or more of the regulator circuits, especially at high currents. A torroid or E-core inductor (closed\nmagnetic structure) should be used in these situations.\nThe inductors listed in the selection chart include ferrite E-core construction for Schottky, ferrite bobbin core for\nRenco and Coilcraft, and powdered iron toroid for Pulse Engineering.\nExceeding the maximum current rating of the inductor can cause the inductor to overheat because of the copper\nwire losses, or the core may saturate. If the inductor begins to saturate, the inductance decreases rapidly and\nthe inductor begins to look mainly resistive (the DC resistance of the winding). This can cause the switch current\nto rise very rapidly and force the switch into a cycle-by-cycle current limit, thus reducing the DC output load\ncurrent. This can also result in overheating of the inductor or the LM2596. Different inductor types have different\nsaturation characteristics, so consider this when selecting an inductor.\nThe inductor manufacturer\'s data sheets include current and energy limits to avoid inductor saturation.\nFor continuous mode operation, see the inductor selection graphs in Figure 9-5  through Figure 9-8 .www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nFigure 9-5.

A typical output ripple voltage can range from approximately 0.5% to 3% of the output voltage. To\nobtain low ripple voltage, the ESR of the output capacitor must be low; however, exercise caution when using\nextremely low ESR capacitors because they can affect the loop stability, resulting in oscillation problems. TI\nrecommends a post ripple filter if very low output ripple voltage is required (less than 20 mV) (see Figure 9-10 ).\nThe inductance required is typically between 1 μH and 5 μH, with low DC resistance, to maintain good load\nregulation. A low ESR output filter capacitor is also required to assure good dynamic load response and ripple\nreduction. The ESR of this capacitor may be as low as desired, because it is out of the regulator feedback loop.\nFigure 8-9  shows a typical output ripple voltage, with and without a post ripple filter.\nWhen observing output ripple with a scope, it is essential that a short, low inductance scope probe ground\nconnection be used. Most scope probe manufacturers provide a special probe terminator which is soldered onto\nthe regulator board, preferably at the output capacitor. This provides a very short scope ground, thus eliminating\nthe problems associated with the 3-inch ground lead normally provided with the probe, and provides a much\ncleaner and more accurate picture of the ripple voltage waveform.\nThe voltage spikes are caused by the fast switching action of the output switch and the diode, the parasitic\ninductance of the output filter capacitor, and its associated wiring. To minimize these voltage spikes, the output\ncapacitor should be designed for switching regulator applications, and the lead lengths must be kept very short.\nWiring inductance, stray capacitance, as well as the scope probe used to evaluate these transients, all contribute\nto the amplitude of these spikes.\nWhen a switching regulator is operating in the continuous mode, the inductor current waveform ranges from a\ntriangular to a sawtooth type of waveform (depending on the input voltage). For a given input and output voltage,\nthe peak-to-peak amplitude of this inductor current waveform remains constant. As the load current increases or\ndecreases, the entire sawtooth current waveform also rises and falls. The average value (or the center) of this\ncurrent waveform is equal to the DC load current.\nIf the load current drops to a low enough level, the bottom of the sawtooth current waveform reaches zero, and\nthe switcher smoothly changes from a continuous to a discontinuous mode of operation. Most switcher designs\n(regardless of how large the inductor value is) is forced to run discontinuous if the output is lightly loaded. This is\na perfectly acceptable mode of operation.www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nFigure 9-9. Peak-to-Peak Inductor Ripple Current versus Load Current\nIn a switching regulator design, knowing the value of the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current ( ΔIIND) can be\nuseful for determining a number of other circuit parameters. Parameters such as peak inductor or peak switch\ncurrent, minimum load current before the circuit becomes discontinuous, output ripple voltage, and output\ncapacitor ESR can all be calculated from the peak-to-peak ΔIIND. When the inductor nomographs in Figure 9-5\nthrough Figure 9-8  are used to select an inductor value, the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current can immediately\nbe determined. Figure 9-9  shows the range of ( ΔIIND) that can be expected for different load currents. Figure 9-9\nalso shows how the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current ( ΔIIND) changes as you go from the lower border to the\nupper border (for a given load current) within an inductance region. The upper border represents a higher input\nvoltage, while the lower border represents a lower input voltage.\nThese curves are only correct for continuous mode operation, and only if the inductor selection guides are used\nto select the inductor value.\nConsider the following example:\nVOUT = 5 V, maximum load current of 2.5 A\nVIN = 12 V, nominal, varying between 10 V and 16 V.\nThe selection guide in Figure 9-6  shows that the vertical line for a 2.5-A load current and the horizontal line\nfor the 12-V input voltage intersect approximately midway between the upper and lower borders of the 33- μH\ninductance region. A 33- μH inductor allows a peak-to-peak inductor current ( ΔIIND), which is a percentage of the\nmaximum load current, to flow. In Figure 9-9 , follow the 2.5-A line approximately midway into the inductance\nregion, and read the peak-to-peak inductor ripple current ( ΔIIND) on the left hand axis (approximately 620\nmAp-p).\nAs the input voltage increases to 16 V, approaching the upper border of the inductance region, the inductor\nripple current increases. Figure 9-9  shows that for a load current of 2.5 A, the peak-to-peak inductor ripple\ncurrent (ΔI IND) is 620 mA with 12 V IN, and can range from 740 mA at the upper border (16 V IN) to 500 mA at the\nlower border (10 V IN).\nOnce the ΔIIND value is known, use these equations to calculate additional information about the switching\nregulator circuit.\n1.

These magnetic lines of flux will induce a voltage into any wire or PCB copper trace that comes\nwithin the inductor\'s magnetic field. The strength of the magnetic field, the orientation and location of the PC\ncopper trace to the magnetic field, and the distance between the copper trace and the inductor determine the\namount of voltage generated in the copper trace. Another way of looking at this inductive coupling is to consider\nthe PCB copper trace as one turn of a transformer (secondary) with the inductor winding as the primary. Many\nmillivolts can be generated in a copper trace located near an open-core inductor, which can cause stability\nproblems or high output ripple voltage problems.\nIf unstable operation is seen, and an open-core inductor is used, it is possible that the location of the inductor\nwith respect to other PC traces can be the problem. To determine if this is the problem, temporarily raise the\ninductor away from the board by several inches and then check circuit operation. If the circuit now operates\ncorrectly, then the magnetic flux from the open core inductor is causing the problem. Substituting a closed core\ninductor such as a torroid or E-core will correct the problem, or re-arranging the PC layout can be necessary.\nMagnetic flux cutting the IC device ground trace, feedback trace, or the positive or negative traces of the output\ncapacitor should be minimized.\nSometimes, placing a trace directly beneath a bobbin inductor will provide good results, provided it is exactly in\nthe center of the inductor (because the induced voltages cancel themselves out). However, problems can arise\nif the trace is off center one direction or the other. If flux problems are present, even the direction of the inductor\nwinding can make a difference in some circuits.\nThis discussion on open core inductors is not to frighten users, but to alert users on what kind of problems to\nwatch out for. Open-core bobbin or stick inductors are an inexpensive, simple way of making a compact, efficient\ninductor, and they are used by the millions in many different applications.\n9.2 Typical Applications\n9.2.1 LM2596 Fixed Output Series Buck Regulator\nCIN — 470-μF, 50-V, Aluminum Electrolytic Nichicon PL Series  COUT — 220-μF, 25-V Aluminum Electrolytic, Nichicon PL Series  D1 —\n5-A, 40-V Schottky Rectifier, 1N5825 L1 — 68 μH, L38\nFigure 9-10.

From the inductor value selection guide shown in Figure 9-6 , the inductance region\nintersected by the 12-V horizontal line and the 3-A vertical line is 33 μH, and the inductor code is L40.\n3. Select an appropriate inductor from the four manufacturer\'s part numbers listed in Table 9-1 . The inductance\nvalue required is 33 μH. See row L40 of Table 9-1  and choose an inductor part number from any of the\nmanufacturers shown.

In the majority of applications, low ESR (Equivalent Series Resistance) electrolytic capacitors between 82 μF\nand 820 μF and low ESR solid tantalum capacitors between 10 μF and 470 μF provide the best results. This\ncapacitor must be placed close to the IC using short capacitor leads and short copper traces. Do not use\ncapacitors larger than 820 μF .\nNote\nFor additional information, see section on output capacitors in Table 9-3 .\n2.

The capacitor voltage rating for electrolytic capacitors should be at least 1.5 times greater than the output\nvoltage, and often require much higher voltage ratings to satisfy the low ESR requirements for low output\nripple voltage.\nFor a 5-V output, a capacitor voltage rating of at least 7.5 V is required. But even a low ESR, switching\ngrade, 220-μF, 10-V aluminum electrolytic capacitor would exhibit approximately 225 mΩ of ESR (see Figure\n9-2 for the ESR versus voltage rating). This amount of ESR would result in relatively high output ripple\nvoltage. To reduce the ripple to 1% or less of the output voltage, a capacitor with a higher value or with a\nhigher voltage rating (lower ESR) must be selected. A 16-V or 25-V capacitor will reduce the ripple voltage\nby approximately half.www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\n9.2.1.2.4 Catch Diode Selection (D1)\n1.

The reverse voltage rating of the diode must be at least 1.25 times the maximum input voltage.\n3. This diode must be fast (short reverse recovery time) and must be placed close to the LM2596 using short\nleads and short-printed circuit traces. Because of their fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop,\nSchottky diodes provide the best performance and efficiency, and must be the first choice, especially in\nlow output voltage applications. Ultra-fast recovery, or high-efficiency rectifiers also provide good results.\nUltra-fast recovery diodes typically have reverse recovery times of 50 ns or less. Rectifiers such as the\n1N5400 series must not be used because they are too slow.\n9.2.1.2.5 Input Capacitor (C IN)\nA low ESR aluminum or tantalum bypass capacitor is required between the input pin and ground pin to prevent\nlarge voltage transients from appearing at the input. This capacitor must be placed close to the IC using short\nleads. In addition, the RMS current rating of the input capacitor should be selected to be at least ½ the DC\nload current. The capacitor manufacturers data sheet must be checked to assure that this current rating is not\nexceeded. Figure 9-1  shows typical RMS current ratings for several different aluminum electrolytic capacitor\nvalues.\nFor an aluminum electrolytic, the capacitor voltage rating must be approximately 1.5 times the maximum input\nvoltage. Exercise caution if solid tantalum capacitors are used (see Section 9.1.1 ). The tantalum capacitor\nvoltage rating should be 2 times the maximum input voltage and TI recommends that they be surge current\ntested by the manufacturer.\nUse caution when using ceramic capacitors for input bypassing, because it may cause severe ringing at the V IN\npin.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n26 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nThe important parameters for the Input capacitor are the input voltage rating and the RMS current rating. With\na nominal input voltage of 12 V, an aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a voltage rating greater than 18 V\n(1.5 × V IN) is necessary. The next higher capacitor voltage rating is 25 V.\nThe RMS current rating requirement for the input capacitor in a buck regulator is approximately ½ the DC load\ncurrent. In this example, with a 3-A load, a capacitor with a RMS current rating of at least 1.5 A is required.\nFigure 9-1  can be used to select an appropriate input capacitor. From the curves, locate the 35-V line and note\nwhich capacitor values have RMS current ratings greater than 1.5 A. A 680-μF, 35-V capacitor could be used.\nFor a through-hole design, a 680- μF, 35-V electrolytic capacitor (Panasonic HFQ series or Nichicon PL series or\nequivalent) would be adequate. Other types or other manufacturers\' capacitors can be used provided the RMS\nripple current ratings are adequate.\nFor surface-mount designs, solid tantalum capacitors can be used, but exercise caution with regard to the\ncapacitor surge current rating (see Section 9.1.1  in this data sheet). The TPS series available from AVX, and the\n593D series from Sprague are both surge current tested.\n9.2.1.3 Application Curves\nContinuous Mode Switching Waveforms V IN = 20 V, V OUT = 5\nV, ILOAD = 2 A, L = 32 μH, C OUT = 220 μF, C OUT ESR = 50 mΩ\nA: Output Pin Voltage, 10 V/div.

Select an appropriate inductor from the manufacturers\' part numbers listed in Table 9-1 . From the table in\nTable 9-1 , locate line L39, and select an inductor part number from the list of manufacturers part numbers.\n9.2.2.2.3 Output Capacitor Selection (C OUT)\n1. In the majority of applications, low ESR electrolytic or solid tantalum capacitors between 82 μF and 820 μF\nprovide the best results. This capacitor must be placed close to the IC using short capacitor leads and short\ncopper traces. Do not use capacitors larger than 820 μF.\nNote\nFor additional information, see section on output capacitors in Section 9.1.3  section.\n2. To simplify the capacitor selection procedure, see Table 9-6  for a quick design guide. This table contains\ndifferent output voltages, and lists various output capacitors that will provide the best design solutions.\nFrom Table 9-6 , locate the output voltage column. From that column, locate the output voltage closest to\nthe output voltage in your application. In this example, select the 24-V line. Under the Section 9.1.3  section,\nselect a capacitor from the list of through-hole electrolytic or surface-mount tantalum types from four different\ncapacitor manufacturers. TI recommends that both the manufacturers and the manufacturers\' series that are\nlisted in Table 9-6  be used.\nIn this example, through hole aluminum electrolytic capacitors from several different manufacturers are\navailable.\n• 220-μF, 35-V Panasonic HFQ Series\n• 150-μF, 35-V Nichicon PL Series\n3. The capacitor voltage rating must be at least 1.5 times greater than the output voltage, and often much\nhigher voltage ratings are required to satisfy the low ESR requirements required for low output ripple voltage.\nFor a 20-V output, a capacitor rating of at least 30 V is required. In this example, either a 35-V or 50-V\ncapacitor would work. A 35-V rating was chosen, although a 50-V rating could also be used if a lower output\nripple voltage is required.\nOther manufacturers or other types of capacitors may also be used, provided the capacitor specifications\n(especially the 100-kHz ESR) closely match the types listed in Table 9-6 . Refer to the capacitor\nmanufacturers data sheet for this information.\n9.2.2.2.4 Feedforward Capacitor (C FF)\nSee Table 9-6 .\nFor output voltages greater than approximately 10 V, an additional capacitor is required. The compensation\ncapacitor is typically between 100 pF and 33 nF, and is wired in parallel with the output voltage setting resistor,\nR2. It provides additional stability for high output voltages, low input or output voltages, or very low ESR output\ncapacitors, such as solid tantalum capacitors. Calculate the value for C FF with Equation 6 :\n(6)\nThis capacitor type can be ceramic, plastic, silver mica, and so forth. Because of the unstable characteristics of\nceramic capacitors made with Z5U material, they are not recommended.\nTable 9-6  contains feedforward capacitor values for various output voltages.

The catch diode current rating must be at least 1.3 times greater than the maximum load current. Also, if the\npower supply design must withstand a continuous output short, the diode must have a current rating equal\nto the maximum current limit of the LM2596. The most stressful condition for this diode is an overload or\nshorted output condition. See Table 9-4 . Schottky diodes provide the best performance, and in this example,\na 5-A, 40-V, 1N5825 Schottky diode would be a good choice. The 5-A diode rating is more than adequate\nand will not be overstressed even for a shorted output.\n2. The reverse voltage rating of the diode must be at least 1.25 times the maximum input voltage.\n3. This diode must be fast (short reverse recovery time) and must be placed close to the LM2596 using short\nleads and short-printed circuit traces. Because of their fast switching speed and low forward voltage drop,\nSchottky diodes provide the best performance and efficiency, and must be the first choice, especially in low\noutput voltage applications. Ultra-fast recovery or high-efficiency rectifiers are also good choices, but some\ntypes with an abrupt turnoff characteristic may cause instability or EMl problems. Ultra-fast recovery diodes\ntypically have reverse recovery times of 50 ns or less. Rectifiers such as the 1N4001 series must not be\nused because they are too slow.\n9.2.2.2.6 Input Capacitor (C IN)\nA low ESR aluminum or tantalum bypass capacitor is required between the input pin and ground to prevent large\nvoltage transients from appearing at the input. In addition, the RMS current rating of the input capacitor should\nbe selected to be at least ½ the DC load current. The capacitor manufacturers data sheet must be checked to\nassure that this current rating is not exceeded. Figure 9-1  shows typical RMS current ratings for several different\naluminum electrolytic capacitor values.\nThis capacitor must be placed close to the IC using short leads and the voltage rating must be approximately 1.5\ntimes the maximum input voltage.\nIf solid tantalum input capacitors are used, TI recommends that they be surge current tested by the\nmanufacturer.\nUse caution when using a high dielectric constant ceramic capacitor for input bypassing, because it may cause\nsevere ringing at the V IN pin.\nThe important parameters for the input capacitor are the input voltage rating and the RMS current rating. With\na nominal input voltage of 28 V, an aluminum electrolytic aluminum electrolytic capacitor with a voltage rating\ngreater than 42 V (1.5 × V IN) is required. Because the the next higher capacitor voltage rating is 50 V, a 50-V\ncapacitor must be used. The capacitor voltage rating of (1.5 × V IN) is a conservative guideline, and can be\nmodified somewhat if desired.\nThe RMS current rating requirement for the input capacitor of a buck regulator is approximately ½ the DC load\ncurrent. In this example, with a 3-A load, a capacitor with a RMS current rating of at least 1.5 A is required.LM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021 www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nFigure 9-1  can be used to select an appropriate input capacitor.

Rapidly switching currents associated with wiring\ninductance can generate voltage transients which can cause problems. For minimal inductance and ground\nloops, the wires indicated by heavy lines must be wide printed-circuit traces and must be kept as short as\npossible. For best results, external components must be placed as close to the switcher lC as possible using\nground plane construction or single point grounding.\nIf open core inductors are used, take special care selecting the location and positioning of this type of inductor.\nAllowing the inductor flux to intersect sensitive feedback, lC groundpath and C OUT wiring can cause problems.\nWhen using the adjustable version, take special care selecting the location of the feedback resistors and the\nassociated wiring. Physically place both resistors near the IC, and route the wiring away from the inductor,\nespecially an open-core type of inductor (see Section 9.1.7  for more information).\n11.2 Layout Examples\nCIN — 470-μF, 50-V, Aluminum Electrolytic Panasonic, HFQ Series  COUT — 330-μF, 35-V, Aluminum Electrolytic Panasonic, HFQ\nSeries  D1 — 5-A, 40-V Schottky Rectifier, 1N5825 L1 — 47-μH, L39, Renco, Through Hole Thermalloy Heat Sink #7020\nFigure 11-1.

These temperature rise numbers are all approximate and there are\nmany factors that can affect these temperatures. Higher ambient temperatures require more heat sinking.\nThe TO-263 surface mount package tab is designed to be soldered to the copper on a printed-circuit board\n(PCB). The copper and the board are the heat sink for this package and the other heat producing components,\nsuch as the catch diode and inductor. The PCB copper area that the package is soldered to must be at\nleast 0.4 in2, and ideally must have two or more square inches of 2-oz. (0.0028 in.) copper. Additional copper\narea improves the thermal characteristics, but with copper areas greater than approximately 6 in2, only small\nimprovements in heat dissipation are realized. If further thermal improvements are required, TI recommends\ndouble-sided, multilayer PCB with large copper areas and airflow.\nFigure 11-4  shows the LM2596S (TO-263 package) junction temperature rise above ambient temperature with\na 2-A load for various input and output voltages. This data was taken with the circuit operating as a buck\nswitching regulator with all components mounted on a PCB to simulate the junction temperature under actual\noperating conditions. This curve can be used for a quick check for the approximate junction temperature for\nvarious conditions, but be aware that there are many factors that can affect the junction temperature. When load\ncurrents higher than 2 A are used, double-sided or multilayer PCB with large copper areas or airflow might be\nrequired, especially for high ambient temperatures and high output voltages.\nFor the best thermal performance, wide copper traces and generous amounts of PCB copper must be used in\nthe board layout. (One exception to this is the output (switch) pin, which should not have large areas of copper.)\nLarge areas of copper provide the best transfer of heat (lower thermal resistance) to the surrounding air, and\nmoving air lowers the thermal resistance even further.\nPackage thermal resistance and junction temperature rise numbers are all approximate, and there are many\nfactors that will affect these numbers. Some of these factors include board size, shape, thickness, position,\nlocation, and even board temperature. Other factors are trace width, total printed-circuit copper area, copper\nthickness, single- or double-sided multilayer board, and the amount of solder on the board. The effectiveness of\nthe PCB to dissipate heat also depends on the size, quantity, and spacing of other components on the board, as\nwell as whether the surrounding air is still or moving. Furthermore, some of these components such as the catch\ndiode will add heat to the PCB and the heat can vary as the input voltage changes. For the inductor, depending\non the physical size, type of core material, and the DC resistance, it can either act as a heat sink taking heat\naway from the board, or it could add heat to the board.\nCIRCUIT DATA FOR TEMPERATURE RISE CURVE TO-220 PACKAGE (T)www.ti.comLM2596\nSNVS124F – NOVEMBER 1999 – REVISED APRIL 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 35\nProduct Folder Links: LM2596\nCapacitors Through-hole electrolytic\nInductor Through-hole, Renco\nDiode Through-hole, 5-A 40-V, Schottky\nPCB 3-square inch, single-sided, 2-oz. copper (0.0028″)\nFigure 11-3.
