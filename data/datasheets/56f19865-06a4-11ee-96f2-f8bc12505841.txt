Typical Application Circuit\n \nGENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe ADP3339 is a member of the ADP33xx family of precision, \nlow dropout, anyCAP® voltage regulators. The ADP3339 operates with an input voltage range of 2.8 V to 6 V and delivers a load current up to 1.5 A. The ADP3339 stands out from the conventional LDOs with a novel architecture and an enhanced \nprocess that enables it to offer performance advantages and \nhigher output current than its competition. Its patented design requires only a 1.0 μF output capacitor for stability. This device is insensitive to output capacitor equivalent series resistance (ESR), and is stable with any good quality capacitor, including ceramic (MLCC) types for space-restricted applications. The ADP3339 achieves exceptional accuracy of ±0.9% at room temperature and ±1.5% over temperature, line, and load variations. The dropout voltage of the ADP3339 is only 230 mV \n(typical) at 1.5 A. The device also includes a safety current limit \nand thermal overload protection. The ADP3339 has ultralow \nquiescent current: 130 μA (typical) in light load situations. \n \n \n \nADP3339 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Output Noise Density \n \nData Sheet ADP3339\n \nRev. C | Page 9 of 12 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe ADP3339 anyCAP LDO uses a single control loop for \nregulation and reference functions. The output voltage is sensed by a resistive voltage divider, consisting of R1 and R2, which is varied to provide the available output voltage option. Feedback \nis taken from this network by way of a series diode (D1) and a \nsecond resistor divider (R3 and R4) to the input of an amplifier. \nA very high gain error amplifier is used to control this loop. The \namplifier is constructed in such a way that equilibrium produces a large, temperature-proportional input offset voltage that is repeata-\nble and very well controlled. The temperature-proportional \noffset voltage is combined with the complementary diode volt-\nage to form a virtual band gap voltage that is implicit in the \nnetwork, although it never appears explicitly in the circuit. Ultimately, this patented design makes it possible to control the loop with only one amplifier. This technique also improves the noise characteristics of the amplifier by providing more flexibil-\nity on the trade-off of noise sources that leads to a low noise design.  \nThe R1/R2 divider is chosen in the same ratio as the band gap \nvoltage to the output voltage. Although the R1/R2 resistor \ndivider is loaded by Diode D1 and a second divider consisting of R3 and R4, the values can be chosen to produce a temperature-stable output. This unique arrangement specifically corrects for the loading of the divider, thus avoiding the error resulting from \nbase current loading in conventional circuits. \nThe patented amplifier controls a new and unique noninverting \ndriver that drives the pass transistor, Q1. The use of this special \nnoninverting driver enables the frequency compensation to \ninclude the load capacitor in a pole-splitting arrangement to achieve reduced sensitivity to the value, type, and ESR of the \nload capacitance. Most LDOs place very strict requirements on the range of ESR \nvalues for the output capacitor because they are difficult to stabilize due to the uncertainty of load capacitance and resis-tance. Moreover, the ESR value required to keep conventional \nLDOs stable changes depending on load and temperature. \nThese ESR limitations make designing with LDOs more difficult because of their unclear specifications and extreme \nvariations over temperature.  \nWith the ADP3339 anyCAP LDO, this is no longer true. The \nADP3339 can be used with virtually any good quality capacitor, with no constraint on the minimum ESR. This innovative \ndesign allows the circuit to be stable with just a small 1 μF \ncapacitor on the output. Additional advantages of the pole-splitting scheme include superior line noise rejection and very high regulator gain, which lead to excellent line and load regulation. An impressive ±1.5% accuracy is guaranteed over \nline, load, and temperature. \nAdditional features of the circuit include current limit and \nthermal shutdown. \nVIN\nOUT\nADP3339C1\n1μFC2\n1μFVOUT\nGND IN\n02191-0-021 \nFigure 20.

Functional Block Diagram \n \nADP3339 Data Sheet\n \nRev. C | Page 10 of 12 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nCAPACITOR SELECTION \nOutput Capacitor \nThe stability and transient response of the LDO is a function of \nthe output capacitor. The ADP3339 is stable with a wide range \nof capacitor values, types, and ESR (anyCAP). A capacitor as low as 1 μF is all that is needed for stability. A higher capacitance may be necessary if high output current surges are anticipated, or if \nthe output capacitor cannot be located near the output and \nground pins. The ADP3339 is stable with extremely low ESR capacitors (ESR ≈ 0) such as multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) or OSCON. Note that the effective capacitance of some capacitor types falls below the minimum over tempera-\nture or with dc voltage. \nInput Capacitor \nAn input bypass capacitor is not strictly required but is recom-\nmended in any application involving long input wires or high \nsource impedance. Connecting a 1 μF capacitor from the input to ground reduces the circuit’s sensitivity to PC board layout \nand input transients. If a larger output capacitor is necessary, a \nlarger value input capacitor is also recommended. \nOUTPUT CURRENT LIMIT \nThe ADP3339 is short-circuit protected by limiting the pass \ntransistor’s base drive current. The maximum output current is \nlimited to about 3 A. See Figure 16 . \nTHERMAL OVERLOAD PROTECTION \nThe ADP3339 is protected against damage due to excessive power \ndissipation by its thermal overload protection circuit. Thermal \nprotection limits the die temperature to a maximum of 160°C. Under extreme conditions (that is, high ambient temperature \nand power dissipation) where the die temperature starts to rise \nabove 160°C, the output current is reduced until the die tempera-\nture has dropped to a safe level.  \nCurrent and thermal limit protections are intended to protect \nthe device against accidental overload conditions. For normal operation, the device’s power dissipation should be externally \nlimited so that the junction temperature does not exceed 150°C. \nCALCULATING POWER DISSIPATION \nDevice power dissipation is calculated as follows: \nPD = (VIN – V OUT) × I LOAD + (VIN × IGND) \nwhere ILOAD and IGND are the load current and ground current, \nand VIN and V OUT are the input and output voltages, respectively. \nAssuming worst-case operating conditions are I LOAD = 1.5 A, \nIGND = 14 mA, V IN = 3.3 V , and V OUT = 2.5 V , the device power \ndissipation is \nPD = (3.3 V – 2.5 V) × 1500 mA + (3.3 V × 14 mA) = 1246 mW Therefore, for a junction temperature of 125°C and a maximum \nambient temperature of 85°C, the required thermal resistance \nfrom junction to ambient is \nC/W 1 . 32W 246 . 1C 85 C 125° =°−°=JAθ  \nPRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD LAYOUT \nCONSIDERATIONS \nThe thermal resistance, θ JA, of SOT-223 is determined by the \nsum of the junction-to-case and the case-to-ambient thermal \nresistances. The junction-to- case thermal resistance, θ JC, is \ndetermined by the package design and specified at 26.8°C/W . \nHowever, the case-to-ambient thermal resistance is determined \nby the printed circuit board design. \nAs shown in Figure 22 , the amount of copper onto which the \nADP3339 is mounted affects thermal performance. When \nmounted onto the minimal pads of 2 oz. copper (see Figure 22 a), \nθJA is 126.6°C/W . Adding a small copper pad under the \nADP3339 (see Figure 22 b) reduces the θ JA to 102.9°C/W . \nIncreasing the copper pad to 1 square inch (see Figure 22 c) \nreduces the θ JA even further, to 52.8°C/W . \n02191-0-022\nc ab  \nFigure 22. PCB Layouts \nUse the following general guidelines when designing printed \ncircuit boards: \n1. Keep the output capacitor as close to the output and \nground pins as possible. \n2. Keep the input capacitor as close to the input and ground pins as possible. \n3. PC board traces with larger cross sectional areas remove more heat from the ADP3339. For optimum heat transfer, use thick copper and use wide traces. \n4. The thermal resistance can be decreased by adding a copper pad under the ADP3339, as shown in Figure 22 b. \n5. If possible, use the adjacent area to add more copper \naround the ADP3339. Connecting the copper area to the \noutput of the ADP3339, as shown in Figure 22 c, is best, but \nthermal performance is improved even if it is connected to other pins. \n6. Use additional copper layers or planes to reduce the \nthermal resistance. Again, connecting the other layers to \nthe output of the ADP3339 is best, but is not necessary. When connecting the output pad to other layers, use multiple vias. \n \nData Sheet ADP3339\n \nRev.
