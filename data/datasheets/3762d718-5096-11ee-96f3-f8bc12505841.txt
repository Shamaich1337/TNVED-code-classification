It is also referred to as MEGACAP . Because the metal \nframe relieves mechanical stress and thermal shock, CKG series is an extremely reliable product. In addition, the stacked type is effective in mount-\ning area reduction because twice capacitance functions by the stacked structure.\n˙FEATURES\n• Metal frames relieve mechanical stress and thermal shock.\n\x81 Stacked type has twice the ca pacitance in the same area.\n\x81 C0G type having excellent stable temperature and DC-bias character-\nistics is also available.\n\x81 Mounting on aluminum board is possible.˙APPLICATIONS\n\x81 X7x products: Smoothing and decoupling applications requiring high\ncapacitance\n\x81C 0 G  p r o d u c t s :  L C  r e s o n a nt circuits of wireless power transfer, etc.\n˙SHAPE & DIMENSIONS\n\uf02a\uf020Dimensional tolerances are typical values.Single type Stacked type\nW\nTL\nEW\nTL\nE\nL\nW\nT\nEProduct length\nProduct widthProduct thickness\nMetal-frame widthL\nW\nT\nEProduct length\nProduct width\nProduct thickness\nMetal-frame widthDimensions in mm\nType L W T E\nCKG32K 3.60±0.30 2.60±0.30 3.35±0.10 0.80±0.15\nCKG45K 5.00±0.50 3.50±0.50 2.90±0.10 1.10±0.30\nCKG57K 6.00±0.50 5.00±0.50 3.35±0.15 1.60±0.30\nCKG45N 5.00±0.50 3.50±0.50 5.00±0.50 1.10±0.30\nCKG57N 6.00±0.50 5.00±0.50 5.00±0.50 1.60±0.30REACH\nSVHC-FreeLead\nFreeRoHSPb\nHalogen\nFreeBrCl\n(4/10)\n20221207 / mlcc_commercial_megacap_en.fmPlease be sure to request delivery specifications that provide fu rther details on the features and specifications of the produc ts for proper and safe use.\nPlease note that the contents may change without any prior notice due to reasons such as upgrading.\nMULTILAYER CERAMIC CHIP CAPACITORS\n˙CATALOG NUMBER CONSTRUCTION\n(1) Series\n(2) Dimensions L x W (mm)\n(3) Structure\n(4) Temperature characteristics\n(5) Rated voltage (DC)(6) Nominal capacitance (pF)\nThe capacitance is expressed in three digit codes and in units of \npico Farads (pF).
