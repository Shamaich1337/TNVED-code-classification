This switch \nis designed on an enhanced LC2MOS process that provides low \npower dissipation yet gives high switching speed, low on resistance, \nand low leakage currents. \nThe on resistance profile of the ADG419 is very flat over the full \nanalog input range, ensuring excellent linearity and low distortion. The part also exhibits high switching speed and high signal bandwidth. CMOS construction ensures ultralow power \ndissipation, making the parts ideally suited for portable and \nbattery-powered instruments. \nEach switch of the ADG419 conducts equally well in both \ndirections when on and has an input signal range that extends \nto the supplies. In the off condition, signal levels up to the supplies are blocked. The ADG419 exhibits break-before-make \nswitching action. PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS \n1. Extended Signal Range.  \nThe ADG419 is fabricated on an enhanced LC2MOS \nprocess, giving an increased signal range that extends to \nthe supply rails.  \n2. Ultralow Power Dissipation. \n3. Low R ON. \n4. Single-Supply Operation. For applications where the analog signal is unipolar, the \nADG419 can be operated from a single rail power supply. \nThe part is fully specified with a single 12 V power supply and remains functional with single supplies as low as 5 V . \n \n \nADG419  \n \nRev.
