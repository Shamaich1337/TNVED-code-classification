The relays should be stored at ambient conditions of ≤30℃ and ≤60%\n      RH after they are removed from their packaging, and should be used within 168 hours. If the relays cannot be used within 168 hours, please\n      repack them or store them in a drying oven at 25 ℃±5℃, ≤10% RH. Otherwise, relays may be subjected to a soldering test to check their\n       performance, or they may be used after keeping them in an oven for 72 hours at with 50 ℃±5℃, ≤30% RH.\n'}]
