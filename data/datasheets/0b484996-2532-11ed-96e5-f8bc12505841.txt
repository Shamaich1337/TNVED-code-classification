APPLICATION NOTES  \nSTORAGE  \nTo prevent the damage of solderability of terminations, the following storage conditions are recomme nded :  \nIndoors under 5 ~ 40°C and 20% ~ 70% RH.  \nNo harmful gases containing sulfuric acid, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or chlor ine. \nPackaging should not be opened until the capacitors are required for use. If opened, the pack should  be \nre-sealed as soon as is practicable. Taped product should be stored out of direct sunlight, which might  promote \ndeterioration in tape or adhesion p erformance. The product is recommended to be used within 12 months after \nshipment and checked the solderability before use.  \n \nHANDLING  \nChip capacitors are dense, hard, brittle, and abrasive materials. They are liable to suffer mechanic al \ndamage, in the form  of cracks or chips. Chip Capacitors should be handled with care to avoid contamination or \ndamage. To use vacuum or plastic tweezers to pick up or plastic tweezers is recommended for manual \nplacement. Tape and reeled packages are suitable for automatic pic k and placement machine.  \n \nPREHEAT  \nIn order to minimize the risk of thermal shock during soldering, a carefully controlled preheat is r equired. \nThe rate of preheat should not exceed 3 °C per second.  \n \nSOLDERING  \nUse middy activated rosin RA and RMA fluxes do n ot use activated flux. The amount of solder in each \nsolder joint should be controlled to prevent the damage of chip capacitors caused by the stress between solder, \nchips, and substrate.  \na.)

Natural cooling in air is \nrecommended to minimize stress in the solder joint.  \n \nCLEANING  \nAll flux residues must be removed by using suitable electronic -grade vapor -cleaning solvents to eliminate \ncontamination that could cause electrolytic surface corrosion. Good results can be obtained by using  ultrasonic \ncleaning of the solvent. The choice of the proper system is depends upon many fac tors such as component mix, \nflux, and solder paste and assembly method. The ability of the cleaning system to remove flux residu es and \ncontamination from under the chips is very important.  \n\n'}]
