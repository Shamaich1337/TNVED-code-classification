These statements are based on our knowledge of typical\nrequirements that are often placed on our products in the areas  of application concerned. We\nnevertheless expressly point out that such statements cannot be regarded as binding\nstatements about the suitability of our products for a particular customer application.  As a\nrule we are either unfamiliar with individual customer applicat ions or less familiar with them than\nthe customers themselves.

We also point out that in individual cases, a malfunction of electronic components or  failure\nbefore the end of their usual service life cannot be completely  ruled out in the current state\nof the art, even if they are operated as specified.  In customer applications requiring a very high\nlevel of operational safety and especially in customer applicat ions in which the malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component could endanger human life or  health (e.g. in accident\nprevention or life-saving systems), it must therefore be ensure d by means of suitable design of the\ncustomer application or other action taken by the customer (e.g. installation of protective circuitry\nor redundancy) that no injury or damage is sustained by third p arties in the event of malfunction or\nfailure of an electronic component.\n3.The warnings, cautions and product-specific notes must be obser ved.\n4.

#### Description:
The B72660M0251K072 is a metal oxide varistor (MOV) designed for transient voltage suppression. It is part of the SIOV (Surge Protective Device) series from TDK, specifically tailored for surface mount applications. Varistors are voltage-dependent resistors that protect electronic circuits from voltage spikes by clamping excess voltage and diverting surge currents away from sensitive components.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Power Management:** Used in power supply circuits to protect against voltage transients and surges.
- **Signal Processing:** Employed in signal lines to prevent overvoltage conditions that could damage sensitive components.
- **Consumer Electronics:** Commonly found in devices such as televisions, computers, and home appliances to enhance reliability and safety.
- **Telecommunications:** Protects communication lines from lightning strikes and other transient events.

This varistor is particularly suitable for applications requiring robust protection against high-energy surges, making it an essential component in various electronic systems.
