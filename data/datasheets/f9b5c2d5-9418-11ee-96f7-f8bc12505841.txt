The IR2153 provides more functionality and is easier to use than previous ICs.  A shutdown feature\nhas been designed into the C T pin, so that both gate driver outputs can be disabled us ing a low voltage control\nsignal. In addition, the gate driver output pulse widths are the same once the ris ing undervoltage lockout\nthreshold on V CC has been reached, resulting in a more stable profile of fre quency vs time at startup.\nNoise immunity has been improved significantly, both by lowering the peak di/dt of the gate drivers, and by\nincreasing the undervoltage lockout hysteresis to 1V. Finally, spe cial attention has been payed to maximizing\nthe latch immunity of the device, and providing comprehen sive ESD protection on all pins.\nwww.irf.com 1Packages\n8 Lead PDIP\n 8 Lead SOICData Sheet No. PD60062 rev P \nIR2153(D)(S) & (PbF)\n2 www.irf.com\nNOTE:For new designs, we recommend\nIR’s new product IRS2153D\nNote 1: This IC contains a zener clamp structure between the chip V CC and COM which has a nominal breakdown\nvoltage of 15.6V.
