General description\nThe 74CB3Q3257-Q100 is a quad high-bandwidth single-pole, double-throw FET bus switch. The\ndevice features one select input (S) and one output enable input ( OE). The switch is disabled when\nthe OE input is HIGH. An internal charge-pump increases the gate voltage of the NMOS pass\ntransistor. The result is improved RON and R ON(flat)  performance and the ability to switch 5 V signals\nwhen V CC = 3.3 V.\nThis product has been qualified to the Automotive Electronics Council (AEC) standard Q100\n(Grade 3) and is suitable for use in automotive applications.\n2.  Features and benefits\n•Automotive product qualification in accordance with AEC-Q100 (Grade 3)\n•Specified from -40 °C to +85 °C\n•Wide supply voltage range from 2.3 V to 3.6 V\n•Overvoltage switching on switch ports:\n•0 V to 5 V switching with V CC = 2.5 V\n•0 V to 5 V switching with V CC = 3.3 V\n•4 Ω (typical) ON resistance\n•3.5 pF (typical) OFF-state capacitance\n•High bandwidth 0.5 GHz (maximum)\n•Low input/output capacitance minimizes loading and signal distortion\n•Fast switching frequency f max = 20 MHz (maximum)\n•Low power consumption I CC = 0.4 mA (typical)\n•Control inputs can be driven by TTL or 5 V/3.3 V CMOS outputs\n•IOFF supports partial power-down mode operation\n•Latch-up performance exceeds 100 mA per JESD 78E Class II Level A\n•ESD protection:\n•MIL-STD-883, method 3015 exceeds 2000 V\n•HBM ANSI/ESDA/Jedec JS-001 Class 2 exceeds 2 kV\n3.
