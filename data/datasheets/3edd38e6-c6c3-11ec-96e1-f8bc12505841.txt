DK0xxG \noperates in discontinuous current conduction \nmode (DCM) . In this mode, the main power \ndevice turns on when the  transformer core \nenergy is fully released and the primary \ninductor resonates with  GaN HEMT output  to a \nminimum value . In this case, system overa ll \nefficiency and EMI performance both can be  \nimprov ed.  \n \n◆ Start -up \nDuring  start-up, DK0xxG  charges the \nexternal V CC capacitor through the internal HV \ncurrent source connected to HV and V CC pins. \nWhen the V CC voltage rises to V CC(start), HV \ncurrent source is turned off and start -up \nprocess is finished.  \n \n◆ Input Voltage Brown -in Detection  \nAfter start-up, DK0xxG generates 3 \nconsecutive PWM cycles to detect input \nvoltage . If the bus  voltage is  larger than \n112V DC, DK0xxG judges that the bus voltage is \npowered -on successful ly and enter s soft start. \nIf the bus voltage is not powered -on \nsuccessfully within  6 consecutive PWM cycles, \nDK0xxG stops PWM  output . After  16ms,  \nDK0xxG  will restart. After V CC is powered up to \nVCC(start) , system enter s the input voltage \npower -on detection.  \n \n◆ Soft Start  \nAfter input voltage is successfully \npower ed-on, DK0xxG  enters soft -start. To \nprevent  output voltage from overshooting , to \nstop the transformer core from being saturat ed \nand to stop  primary and secondary  power \ndevice s from being overstressed, DK0xxG  has \na built -in soft -start circuit.  \n ◆ Input Voltage Brown -out Detection  \nDuring normal operation, input voltage \nbrown -out detection: If the bus voltage is \ncontinuously detected to be lower than 90V DC \nwithin 32ms, DK0xxG  judge s as input voltage \nbrown -out and PWM is stopped. 16ms later, \nDK0xxG will re started  and VCC will rise  up to \nVCC(start) . DK0xxG will enter input voltage \ndetection status.  \n \n⚫ Demagnetization Detection  \nDK0xxG  detects demagnetization  of the \ntransformer  by sens ing the VS pin voltage and \nsampling the auxiliary winding voltage to \nachieve valley turn -on. When the en ergy \nstored in the inductor is completely released, \nthe VS voltage starts to drop. When the VS \nvoltage drops below a predetermined value, \nthe controller turn s on the GaN device  through \nan internal comparator and enters the next \ncycle.  \n \n⚫ Quasi -resonant (QR) mode  \nQuasi-resonant  (QR) flyback mode is a \ntype of discontinuous conduction mode  (DCM ), \nwhich means that after the core energy of the \ntransformer is completely released, the primary \ninductor of the transformer and the output  \ncapacit or of the GaN device  starts to resonate . \nThe power device  turns on when the  output \ncapacitor  of the GaN device  resonates with the \nprimary inductance to a minimum (valley) \nvalue.  \n \n⚫ Valley Lock  \nIn order to limit the maximum frequency \nduring  QR mode, the traditional solution is \nfrequency clamping. However, this will make \nthe turn-on signal  jump s back and forth \nbetween two valleys, which will cause minor  \noperating frequency difference  which will lead \nto acoustic  noise and  output ripple . DK0xxG \n                                                                                              \nDK025G/036G/045G/065G          \n  \nwww.dkpower.cn  7 incorporates valley lock technology to \novercome this problem.    \n \n⚫ Frequency  Jittering  \nDK0xxG contains a fr equency jittering \ncircuit t o reduce EMI interference . By adding a \nlow-frequency triangular wave voltage to the \ninput of the PWM comparator , the jittering \ncircuit can disperse the peak energy of EMI \nnoise.  \n \n⚫ Line Voltage Compensatio n \nDue to turn off delay  of power device , in \norder to limit max output power at the same \nlevel within the whole input voltage range, line \nvoltage compensation circuit is essential. \nDK0xxG incorporates line voltage \ncompensation circuit to insure consistency of \nover curre nt point.  \n \n⚫ Overload/ Short Circuit Protection  \nDK0xxG senses the CS voltage and \njudges if the output is overloaded or shorted. If \nCS voltage exceeds a certain level and holds \nfor a period of time, DK0xxG judges the output \nis overloaded or shorted and enters overload/short circuit protection.  \n⚫ Leading Edge Blanking   \nDue to the presence of transformer \ndistribu ted capacit or, there is a current spike at \nthe moment of power device  turn-on. To avoid  \nwrong actions , DK0xxG contains a leading  \nedge blanking (LEB)  circuit which can \neffectively filter out the spike current when the \npower device  is turned on.  \n⚫  Output Overvoltage Protection (OVP)  \nDK0xxG  can accurately detect the output \nvoltage by sensing the voltage on the auxiliary \nwinding. Therefore, the controller can stop \nPWM output and protect the overall system \nwhen output over voltage happens.  \n⚫  Over Temperature  Protection  \nDK0xxG contains an over-temperature \nprotection circuit which detects the junction \ntemperature of the main  power device. A \nthreshold value temperature T SD is set to with \nhysteresis response. If the junction \ntemperature exceeds the over -temperature \nprotection threshold, DK0xxG  will restart and \nhiccup until the junction temperature drops to a \ncertain temperature.  \n \n \n \n◼ FUNCTION DESCRIPTION  \n⚫ High Voltage Starting Circuit  \nDK0xxG contains multi -function high \nvoltage (HV) pin. As shown in Figure 1, t o \nachieve fast startup  and to reduce standby \npower consumption , DK0xxG contains a HV \nstartup circuit.  Meanwhile, HV pin  can \naccurately monitor the input voltage and enable  the internal X -capacitor  discharge \ncircuit to quickly discharge the X -capacitor \nresidual voltage afte r the input voltage is \npowered off to meet safety regulation \nrequirements.\n \n                                                                                              \nDK025G/036G/045G/065G          \n  \nwww.dkpower.cn  8  \nFigure1 ：High Voltage Start-up Circuit  \n⚫ Feedback Control  \nDK0xxG  adopts cycle -by-cycle current \nlimiting PWM control mode and adjusts the \npeak current of the cycle by detecting the \nfeedback voltage of VFB. When the power \ndevice  is turned on, DK0xxG  samples the \nvoltage over RCS. When voltage over R CS \nreaches V ILIM1, DK0xxG  turns  off the power \ndevice  and waits for the next cycle.  \nWhen load changes, FB voltage will \nchange in a certain range  and will hysteresis in \norder to achieve  quasi resonant valley loc k. \nPower device  turns on at resonate valley will \nreduce the turn -on loss . But if the turn -on point \nswitches back and forth between two adjacent \nvalleys , it will cause a large change in the \noperating  frequency, resulting in audio noise \nand output ripple problems . So w hen the load \nis constant, it is essential to ensure that the \nsystem turns on at a definite valley instead of \nswitching back and forth between two adjacent \nvalleys.  \nWhen  load decreases, FB voltage will fall. \nAfter V FB < FB (vf), the peak current should not  \nbe reduced too fast in order to improve light \nload efficiency , so operating frequency needs \nto be reduced. FB voltage is reduced from \nFB(vf) to FB (std) in this proce dure and peak current gradually becomes smaller, minimum \nto 150mv/R CS. \nWhen the load continues to decrease until \nFB voltage < F B(std), the PWM current \nreference will be maintained at 150mv/R CS. \nAfter that, the operating frequency will \ndecrease  till a minimum  of 25 KHz.  \nWhen FB voltage < FB (std), DK0xxG will \nenter standby mode and stop PWM output. \nWhen FB>FB (std)+50mV , it will exit  standby \nmode an d will output some PWM pulses again \nto maintain the set output voltage. When the \nFB voltage < FB (std) is detected again, it will \nenter standby mode again and stop PWM \noutput . This intermittent mode can effectively \nreduce the switching frequency to improve the \nlight load efficiency.  \n⚫ 25KHz Minimum Frequency Clamp  \nOperati ng fre quency of quasi-resonant \ncontrol  mode flyback SMPS will inc rease with \nload. In ord er to avoid audio noise , DK0xxG \nclamps the lowest frequency to 25KHz , which  \ncan effectively avoid entering  audio noise  \nfrequency range . As shown in Figure 2.\n\n                                                                                              \nDK025G/036G/045G/065G          \n  \nwww.dkpower.cn  9  \n \nFigure2 ：25KHz Minimum Frequency Clamp  \n \n \n \n⚫ VCC Oper ating Mode\nThe start -up duration  is directly related to \nthe V CC capacitor value . As shown in Figure 3, \nunder light or no -load conditions, the controller \noperates at the lowest frequency, so the VCC \ncapacitor must be large enough to keep the \nVCC voltage above V CC (reset). During start -up, DK0xxG  charges the V CC \ncapacitor through a HV start-up circuit. When \nVCC reaches V CC (start) , the HV start-up circuit is \nturned off and DK0x xG starts to output PWM \nsignal  and is powered by the auxiliary winding.  \n \n \nFigure3: V CC Start-up \n \n⚫ Demagnetization Detection\nThe DK0xxG is a flyback SMPS power \nconverter operating in quasi -resonant (QR) \nmode. The primary power device  turns off \nwhen the voltage across the sampling resistor \nRCS reaches V ILIM1. When the voltage across \nthe auxiliary winding of the  transformer is below V TH_VS, the primary power  device turns \non. In this way, switching loss  is reduced and \nelectromagnetic interference (EMI)  is \nimprov ed. As shown in Figure 4, the power \ndevice  turns on once the  VS voltage falls \nbelow the demagnetization threshold V TH_VS . \n \n\n                                                                                              \nDK025G/036G/045G/065G          \n  \nwww.dkpower.cn  10  \nFigure4 ：Auxiliary Winding Waveform and Demagnetization  Detection  \n⚫ Output Over Voltage Protection （OVP） \nOutput o ver voltage protection is achieved \nby detecting the voltage on the VS pin when \nthe primary power device  is turned off. The \nvoltage on VS is proportional to the output \nvoltage, and the proportionality factor is related \nto the turn  ratio of the auxi liary winding and the \nsecondary winding, as well as to the pull -up \nand pull -down resistor voltage division ratio of \nthe auxiliary winding. To ensure a smoother \nvoltage on the VS pin sampled by OVP, \ndelayed sampling  is used  to avoid false trigge ring due to leakage induc tance spikes \nwhen the primary power device  is turned off.  \nAs shown in Figure 5, if the sampled \nvoltage exceeds  VVS_OVP, the internal counter \nstarts. When it is detected that the VS voltage  \nexceeds  the reference voltage for a continuous \n3 cycles, the converter  determines that the \noutput OVP is happening  and controller  stops \nworking.  \nS vsl vshA vsl\nOUT VSN R RNRV V\uf02a+\uf02a\uf02a=) (\n \n \nVOUT is the output voltage, N A is the number of turns of the auxiliary winding, and N S is the \nnumber of turns of the secondary winding , RVSH is the pull -up resistor of the auxiliary winding and \nRVSL is the pull -down resistor.  \n \nFigure5: Output Over Voltage Protection  \n \n\n                                                                                              \nDK025G/036G/045G/065G          \n  \nwww.dkpower.cn  11 ⚫ Input Over Voltage Protection  \nThe DK0xxG detects the input bus voltage when the primary power device  is turned on.  \nAP\nvsh BrowninNNR I V * *Brownin=\n          \nAP\nvsh BrownoutNNR I V * *Brownout=\n \n \n⚫ Line Voltage Power Compensation  \nDK0XXG  adjusts line voltage power compensation by changing R vsh. \nP compA dc\nvshN IN VR**max=\n \nThe VS pull -up resistor is determined first to meet the line voltage power compensation.  \n⚫ Valley Lock  \nConventional quasi -reson ant (QR) flyback \nconverters, the frequency increases as the \nload decreases, and a maximum frequency \nlimit is usually applied . Maximum frequency \nlimit causes the controller to jump back and \nforth between adjacent valleys resulting in system instability and consequently introduce \naudio noise.
