Combining low power (0.35 µW,typ.) with high speed (t\nON: 75 ns, typ.), the DG401 series is\nideally suited for portable and battery powered industrial and\nmilitary applications.\nBuilt on the Vishay Siliconix proprietary high-voltage\nsilicon-gate process to achieve high voltage rating and\nsuperior switch on/off perform ance, break-before-make is\nguaranteed for the SPDT configur ations. An epitaxial layer\nprevents latchup.\nEach switch conducts equally well in both directions when\non, and blocks up to 30 V peak-to-peak when off. On-\nresistance is very flat over the full ± 15 V analog range,\nrivaling JFET performance wit hout the inherent dynamic\nrange limitations.\nThe three devices in this series are differentiated by the type\nof switch action as shown in the functional block diagrams.\nFUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAM AND PIN CONFIGURATION\nTwo SPST Switches per Package\nLogic "0" ≤ 0.8 V\nLogic "1" ≥ 2.4 V \n* Pb containing terminations are not RoHS compliant, exemptions may apply\nDG401\nNC GND\nNC\nVL\nNC\nV+\nNC\nIN2\nD2\nS2D1\nS1\nNCDual-In-Line and SOIC\nIN1\nNC\nV-1\n2\n3\n4\n56\n7\n816\n15\n14\n1312\n11\n10\n9\nTop View\nNC\nNC\nV-\nS2\nNC\nIN2\nGND\nNC\nNC\nD2\nNCNC\nNCS1\nVLIN1\nNCNC\nV+D1\nKey\nTop ViewLCC\n91 0 1 1 1 2 1 34\n5\n6\n7\n81 2 31 9 20\n1415161718DG401\nTRUTH TABLE  \nLogic Switch\n0 OFF1O N\nDownloaded fromArrow.com.\nwww.vishay.com\n2Document Number: 70049\nS09-2561-Rev.

The output of A2 is fed back to A3 and\ncompared to the analog input ein. If ein > eout the output of A3\nis high keeping SW1 closed. This allows C1 to charge up tothe analog input voltage. When ein goes below eout A3 goes\nnegative, turning SW1 off. The system will therefore store the\nmost positive analog input experienced.\nVishay Siliconix maintains worldwide manufacturing capability.
