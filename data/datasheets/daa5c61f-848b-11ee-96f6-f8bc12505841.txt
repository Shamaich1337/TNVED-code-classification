A delta- sigma analog -to-\ndigital converter (ADC) converts the measured temperature to a digital value that is calibrated in °C; for \n°F applications, a lookup table or conversion routine must be used.   \n \nThe temperature reading is provided in a 9- bit, two’s complem ent reading by issuing the READ \nTEMPERATURE command. Table 2 describes the exact relationship of output data to measured temperature. The data is transmitted through the 2 -wire serial interface, MSB first. The DS1621 can \nmeasure temperature over the range of - 55°C to +125°C in 0.5°C increments.  \n 2 of 16 \nDS1621  \nFigure 1.

The second byte \nwould contain the value of the least significant (0.5°C) bit of the temperature reading as shown in Table \n1. Note that the remaining 7 bits of this byte are set to all "0"s.  \n \nTemperature is represented in the DS1621 in terms of a ½ °C LSB, yielding the following 9- bit format: \n \nFigure 2. TEMPERATURE, TH, and TL FORMAT  \n     \nT = - 25°C  \n \nHigher resolutions may be obtained by reading the temperature and truncating the 0.5°C bit (the LSB) \nfrom the read value. This value is TEMP _READ. A Read Counter command should be issued to yield the \nCOUNT_REMAIN value.  The Read Slope command should then be issued to obtain the \nCOUNT_PER_C value. The higher resolution temperature may be then be calculated by the user using the following:  \n \nTEM PERATURE=TEMP_READ -0.25 + \nC PER COUNTREMAIN COUNTC PER COUNT\n_ _) _ _ _ ( − \n \n \nThe DS1621 always powers up in a low power idle state, and the Start Convert T command must be used \nto initiate conversions.    The DS1621 can be programmed to perform continuous consecutive conversions ( continuous -conversion \nmode) or to perform single conversions on command (one -shot mode).  The conversion mode is \nprogrammed through the 1SHOT bit in the configuration register as explained in the Operation and Control  section of this datasheet.  In continuous conversion mode, the DS1621 begins continuous \nconversions after a Start Convert T command is issued.  Consecutive conversions continue to be performed until a Stop Convert T command is issued, at which time the device goes into a low -power idle \nstate.  Continuous conversions can be restarted at any time using the Start Convert T command.  \n 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 MSB  LSB \n 4 of 16 \nDS1621  \nIn one -shot mode, the DS1621 performs a single temperature conversion when a Start Convert T \ncommand is issued.  When the conversion is complete, the device enters a l ow-power idle state and \nremains in that state until a single temperature conversion is again initiated by a Start Convert T \ncommand. \n \nThermostat Control  \nIn its operating mode, the DS1621 functions as a thermostat with programmable hysteresis as shown in Figure 3. The thermostat output updates as soon as a temperature conversion is complete. \n When the DS1621’s temperature meets or exceeds the value stored in the high temperature trip register (TH), the output becomes active and will stay active until the temperature falls below the temperature stored in the low temperature trigger register (TL). In this way, any amount of hysteresis may be obtained.  The active state for the output is programmable by the user so that an active state may either be a logic "1" (V\nDD) or a logic "0" (0V).  This is done using the POL bit in the configuration reagister as explained \nin the Operation and Control  section of this datasheet.  \n \nFigure 3. THERMOSTAT OUTPUT OPERATION  \n \nDQ (Thermostat output, Active = High)  \n         \nOPERATION  AND CONTROL  \nThe DS1621 must have temperature settings resident in the TH and TL registers for thermostatic operation. A configuration/status register also determines the method of operation that the DS1621 will use in a particular application, as well as indicating the status of the temperature conversion operation.  The configuration register is defined as follows:  \n \nMSb  Bit 6  Bit5 Bit 4  Bit 3  Bit 2  Bit 1  LSb \nDONE  THF  TLF NVB  X X POL  1SHOT  \n  where  \n \nDONE  = Conversion Done bit. “1” = Conversion complete, “ 0” = Conversion in progress.  \n THF  = Temperature High Flag. This bit will be set to “1” when the temperature is greater than or \nequal to the value of TH. It will remain “1” until reset by writing “0” into this location or removing power from the device. Thi s feature provides a method of determining if the DS1621 has ever been subjected to \ntemperatures above TH while power has been applied.  \n TL TH T (°C)  \n 5 of 16 \nDS1621  \nTLF  = Temperature Low Flag. This bit will be set to “1” when the temperature is less than or equal \nto the value of TL. It will remain “1” until reset by writing “0” into this location or removing power from \nthe device. This feature provides a method of determining if the DS1621 has ever been subjected to \ntemperatures below TL while power has been applied.  \n NVB  = Nonvolatil e Memory Busy flag. “1” = Write to an E\n2\n memory cell in progress, “0” = \nnonvolatile memory is not busy. A copy to E2\n may take up to 10 ms. \n POL  = Output Polarity Bit. “1” = active high, “0” = active low. This bit is nonvolatile. \n \n1SHOT  = One Shot Mode. If 1SHOT is “1”, the DS1621 will perform one temperature conversion upon \nreceipt of the Start Convert T protocol. If 1SHOT is “0”, the DS1621 will continuously perform \ntemperature conversions. This bit is nonvolatile.  \n \nX = Reserved.  \n \nFor typical thermostat op eration the DS1621 will operate in continuous mode. However, for applications \nwhere only one reading is needed at certain times or to conserve power, the one -shot mode may be used. \nNote that the thermostat output (T\nOUT) will remain in the state it was in a fter the last valid temperature \nconversion cycle when operating in one -shot mode. \n \n2-WIRE SERIAL DATA BUS  \nThe DS1621 supports a bidirectional 2- wire bus and data transmission protocol. A device that sends data \nonto the bus is defined as a transmitter, and a device receiving data as a receiver. The device that controls the message is called a “master." The devices that are controlled by the master are “slaves." The bus must be controlled by a master device which generates the serial clock (SCL), controls the bus access, and \ngenerates the START and STOP conditions. The DS1621 operates as a slave on the 2- wire bus. \nConnections to the bus are made via the open- drain I/O lines SDA and SCL.  \n The following bus protocol has been defined (See Figure 4):  \n \uf0a7 Data transfer may be initiated only when the bus is not busy.  \n \n\uf0a7 During data transfer, the data line must remain stable whenever the clock line is HIGH. Changes in the data line while the clock line is high will be interpreted as control signals.  \n Accordingly, the following bus conditions have been defined:  \n Bus not busy: Both data and clock lines remain HIGH.  \n Start data transfer: A change in the state of the data line, from HIGH to LOW, while the clock is HIGH, defines a START condition.  Stop data transfer: A change i n the state of the data line, from LOW to HIGH, while the clock line is \nHIGH, defines the STOP condition.  Data valid: The state of the data line represents valid data when, after a START condition, the data line is stable for the duration of the HIGH peri od of the clock signal. The data on the line must be changed \nduring the LOW period of the clock signal. There is one clock pulse per bit of data.  \n \n 6 of 16 \nDS1621  \nEach data transfer is initiated with a START condition and terminated with a STOP condition. The \nnumber of da ta bytes transferred between START and STOP conditions is not limited and is determined \nby the master device. The information is transferred byte -wise and each receiver acknowledges with a \nninth- bit. \n Within the bus specifications a regular mode (100kHz cl ock rate) and a fast mode (400kHz clock rate) are \ndefined. The DS1621 works in both modes.  Acknowledge: Each receiving device, when addressed, is obliged to generate an acknowledge after the \nreception of each byte. The master device must generate an extra clock pulse which is associated with this acknowledge bit.  A device that acknowledges must pull down the SDA line during the acknowledge clock pulse in such a way that the SDA line is stable LOW during the HIGH period of the acknowledge related clock pul se. Of \ncourse, setup and hold times must be taken into account. A master must signal an end of data to the slave by not generating an acknowledge bit on the last byte that has been clocked out of the slave. In this case, the slave must leave the data line HIGH to enable the master to generate the STOP condition.  \nFigure 4 . DATA TRANSFER ON 2 -WIRE SERIAL BUS  \n \nFigure 4 details how data transfer is accomplished on the 2- wire bus. Depending upon the state of the \nR/W bit, two types of data transfer are possibl e: \n \n1. Data transfer from a master transmitter to a slave receiver. The first byte transmitted by the \nmaster is the slave address. Next follows a number of data bytes. The slave returns an acknowledge \nbit after each received byte.  \n \n2. Data transfer from a slave transmitter to a master receiver. The first byte, the slave address, is \ntransmitted by the master. The slave then returns an acknowledge bit. Next follows a number of data \nbytes transmitted by the slave to the master. The master returns an acknowledge bit after all received \nbytes other than the last byte. At the end of the last received byte, a ‘not acknowledge’ is returned.  \n The master device generates all of the serial clock pulses and the START and STOP conditions. A transfer is ended with a STOP conditi on or with a repeated START condition. Since a repeated START \ncondition is also the beginning of the next serial transfer, the bus will not be released.  \n \n 7 of 16 \nDS1621  \nThe DS1621 may operate in the following two modes:  \n \n1. Slave receiver mode:  Serial data and clock are received through SDA and SCL. After each byte is \nreceived an acknowledge bit is transmitted. START and STOP conditions are recognized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer. Address recognition is performed by hardware after reception of the slave addr ess and direction bit. \n 2. Slave transmitter mode:  The first byte is received and handled as in the slave receiver mode. \nHowever, in this mode the direction bit will indicate that the transfer direction is reversed. Serial data is transmitted on SDA by the DS 1621 while the serial clock is input on SCL. START and STOP \nconditions are recognized as the beginning and end of a serial transfer.  \n \nSLAVE ADDRESS  \nA control byte is the first byte received following the START condition from the master device. The control byte consists of a 4- bit control code; for the DS1621, this is set as 1001 binary for read and write \noperations. The next 3 bits of the control byte are the device select bits (A2, A1, A0). They are used by the master device to select which of eight device s are to be accessed. These bits are in effect the 3 least \nsignificant bits of the slave address. The last bit of the control byte (R/\nW) defines the operation to be \nperformed. When set to a “1” a read operation is selected, when set t o a “0” a write operation is selected. \nFollowing the START condition the DS1621 monitors the SDA bus checking the device type identifier being transmitted. Upon receiving the 1001 code and appropriate device select bits, the slave device outputs an acknowl edge signal on the SDA line.  \n \n 8 of 16 \nDS1621  \nFigure 5. 2 -WIRE SERIAL COMMUNICATION WITH DS1621  \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n 9 of 16 \nDS1621  \nCOMMAND SET  \nData and control information is read from and written to the DS1621 in the format shown in Figure 5. To \nwrite to the DS1621, the master will issue the sla ve address of the DS1621 and the R/ W bit will be set to \n“0”. After receiving an acknowledge, the bus master provides a command protocol. After receiving this \nprotocol, the DS1621 will issue an acknowledge and then the master may send data to the DS1621. If the DS1621 is to be read, the master must send the command protocol as before and then issue a repeated \nSTART condition and the control byte again, this time with the R/\nW bit set to “1” to allow reading of the \ndata from the DS1621. The command set for the DS1621 as shown in Table 3 is as follows:  \n \nRead Temperature [AAh]  \nThis command reads the last temperature conversion result. The DS1621 will send 2 bytes, in the format \ndescribed earlier, which are the contents of this register.  \n \nAccess TH [A1h]  \nIf R/ W is “0” this command writes to the TH (HIGH TEMPERATURE) register. After issuing this \ncommand, the next 2 bytes written to the DS1621, in the same format as described for reading \ntemperature, w ill set the high temperature threshold for operation of the T OUT  output. If R/ W is “1” the \nvalue stored in this register is read back.  \n \nAccess TL [A2h]  \nIf R/ W is “0” this command writes to the TL (LOW TEMPERATURE ) register. After issuing this \ncommand, the next 2 bytes written to the DS1621, in the same format as described for reading \ntemperature, will set the high temperature threshold for operation of the T OUT  output. If R/ W is “1” the \nvalue  stored in this register is read back.  \n \nAccess Config [ACh]  \nIf R/ W is “0” this command writes to the configuration register. After issuing this command, the next \ndata byte is the value to be written into the configuration register. If  R/W is “1” the next data byte read is \nthe value stored in the configuration register.  \n \nRead Counter [A8h]  \nThis command reads the value Count_Remain. This command is valid only if R/ W is “1”.  \n \nRead Slope [A9h]  \nThis command reads the value Count_Per_C. This command is valid only if R/ W is “1”.  \n \nStart Convert T [EEh]  \nThis command begins a temperature conversion. No further data is required. In one -shot mode the \ntemperature conversion will be pe rformed and then the DS1621 will remain idle. In continuous mode this \ncommand will initiate continuous conversions. \n \nStop Convert T [22h]  \nThis command stops temperature conversion. No further data is required. This command may be used to halt a DS1621 in c ontinuous conversion mode. After issuing this command, the current temperature \nmeasurement will be completed and the DS1621 will remain idle until a Start Convert T is issued to resume continuous operation. \n 10 of 16 \nDS1621  \n \nTable 3.
