An external\n1.0 /C0109F minimum ceramic capacitor recommended must be connected across SIM_V CC and GND.\nDuring a normal operation, the SIM_V CC voltage can be set to 1.8 V followed by a 3.0 V value, or\ncan start directly to any of these two values.\n8 SIM_I/O INPUT/\nOUTPUTThis pin handles the connection to the serial I/O of the card connector.

Care must betaken to avoid voltage spikes when the device operates in a normal operation.\n11 SIM_CLK OUTPUT This pin is connected to the CLOCK pin of the card connector. The CLOCK (CLK) signal comesfrom the external clock generator, the internal level shifter being used to adapt the voltage defined\nfor the SIM_V\nCC.\n12 NC No Connect\n13 CLK INPUT The clock signal, coming from the external controller, must have a Duty Cycle within the Min/Max\nvalues defined by the specification (typically 50%).

This device\nfeatures a very low quiescent current typically lower than\n25 /C0109A (Figure 6 and 7). MOD_V\nCC is a select input\nallowing a logic level signal to select a regulated voltage of\n1.8 V (MOD_V CC = LOW) or 3.0 V (MOD_V CC = HIGH).\nAdditionally, the NCN4555 has a shutdown input allowing\nit to turn off or turn on the regulator output. The shutdownmode power consumption is typically in the range of a fewtens of nA (30 nA Typical). Figure 8 shows a simplifiedview of the NCN4555 voltage regulator. The SIM_V\nCC\noutput is internally current limited and protected againstshort circuits. The short −circuit current IV\nCC is constant\nover the temperature and SIM_V CC. It varies with V BAT\ntypically in the range of 60 mA to 90 mA (Figure 4 and 5).In order to guarantee a stable and satisfying operating of\nthe LDO the SIM_V CC output will be connected to a 1.0 /C0109F\nbypass ceramic capacitor to the ground. At the input, V BAT\nwill be bypassed to the ground with a 0.1 /C0109F ceramic\ncapacitor.\nLEVEL SHIFTERS\nThe level shifters accommodate the voltage difference\nthat might exist between the microcontroller and the smartcard. The RESET and CLOCK level shifters aremonodirectional and feature both the same architecture.\nThe bidirectional I/O line provides a way to automatically\nadapt the voltage difference between the MCU and the SIM\ncard in both directions. In addition with the pullup resistor,an active pullup circuit (Figure 8,  Q1 and Q2) provides a fast\ncharge of the stray capacitance, yielding a rise time fullywithin the ISO7816 specifications.−+\nFigure 8. Simplified Block Diagram of the LDO Voltage Regulator+R1\nR2\nGNDQ1\nVREFCIN = 0.1 /C0109FVBAT\nSTOPSIM_V CC\nMOD_V CCCOUT = 1.0 /C0109FIlim\nFigure 9.

During the first 200 ns (typical),the slope of the rise time is solely a function of the pullupresistor associated with the stray capacitance. During thisperiod, the PMOS devices are not activated since the inputvoltage is below their V\ngs threshold. When the input slope\ncrosses the V gsth, the opposite one shot is activated,\nproviding a low impedance to charge the capacitance, thusincreasing the rise time as depicted in Figure 10. The samemechanism applies for the opposite side of the line to make\nsure the system is optimum.\nINPUT SCHMITT TRIGGERS\nAll the Logic input pins (excepted I/O and SIM_I/O, See\nFigure 3) have built −in Schmitt trigger circuits to prevent\nthe NCN4555 against uncontrolled operation. The typicaldynamic characteristics of the related pins are depictedFigure 11.\nThe output signal is guaranteed to go High when the input\nvoltage is above 0.7 x V\nDD, and will go Low when the input\nvoltage is below 0.4 V .\nSHUTDOWN OPERATING\nIn order to save power or for other purpose required by the\napplication it is possible to put the NCN4555 in a shutdown\nmode by setting Low the pin STOP . On the other hand the\ndevice enters automatically in a shutdown mode when V DD\nbecomes lower than 1.1 V typically.ESD PROTECTION\nThe NCN4555 SIM interface features an HBM ESD\nvoltage protection in excess of 7 kV for all the SIM pins(SIM_IO, SIM_CLK, SIM_RST, SIM_V\nCC and GND). All\nthe other pins (microcontroller side) sustain at least 2 kV .These values are guaranteed for the device in its full integrity\nwithout considering the external capacitors added to thecircuit for a proper operating. Consequently in the operating\nconditions it is able to sustain much more than 7 kV on itsSIM pins making it perfectly protected against electrostaticdischarge well over the HBM ESD voltages required by the\nISO7816 standard (4 kV).\nPRINTED CIRCUIT BOARD LAYOUT\nCareful layout routing will be applied to achieve a good\nand efficient operating of the device in its mobile or portable\nenvironment and fully exploit its performance.\nThe bypass capacitors have to be connected as close as\npossible to the device pins (SIM_V CC, VDD or V BAT) in\norder to reduce as much as possible parasitic behaviors(ripple and noise). It is recommended to useceramic capacitors.\nThe exposed pad of the QFN −16 package will be\nconnected to the ground as well as the unconnected pins(NC). A relatively large ground plane is recommended.\nFigures 12 and 13 shows an example of PCB device\nimplementation in an evaluation environment.\nFigure 10.
