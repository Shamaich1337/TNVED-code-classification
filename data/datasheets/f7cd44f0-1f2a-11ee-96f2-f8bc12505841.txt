The frequency is adjustable from 35 kHz to 1000 kHz. Small \nsize combined with complete functionality makes the part both versatile and easy to use.\nThe controller uses a low-value current-sensing resistor in series with the power MOSFET\'s source connection \nto detect switching current. When the voltage drop across this resistor exceeds 150 mV, the part enters an \nhiccup fault mode with a time period set by the external soft-start capacitor.\nThe TPS40210 uses voltage feedback to an error amplifier that is biased by a precision 700-mV reference. \nThe TPS40211 has a lower 260-mV reference for higher efficiency in LED drive applications. Internal slope \ncompensation eliminates the characteristic sub-harmonic instability of peak current mode control with duty cycles \nof 50% or greater.\nThe TPS4021x also incorporates a soft-start feature where the output follows a slowly rising soft-start voltage, \npreventing output-voltage overshoot. The DIS/ EN disables the TPS40210 putting it in a low quiescent current \nshutdown mode.\n7.2 Functional Block Diagram\n+\n+\nSoft Start\nand\nOvercurrent5 FB4 COMP3 DIS/EN\n700 mVLDO\nPWM\nLogic2 SS\n1 RCOscillator\nand\nSlope\nCompensation\nUVLODriver9 BP10 VDD\n8 GDRV\n6 GND\n7 ISNS+Gain = 6\n+150 mV\nLEBOC FaultOC Fault\nUDG-07107Enable E/AE/A\nSS Ref\nwww.ti.comTPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 11\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n7.3 Feature Description\n7.3.1 Soft Start\nThe soft-start feature of the TPS40210 and TPS40211 is a closed-loop soft start, meaning that the output voltage \nfollows a linear ramp that is proportional to the ramp generated at the SS pin. This ramp is generated by an \ninternal resistor connected from the BP pin to the SS pin and an external capacitor connected from the SS pin to \nGND. The SS pin voltage (V SS) is level shifted down by approximately V SS(ofst)  (approximately 700 mV) and sent \nto one of the “+” (the “+” input with the lowest voltage dominates) inputs of the error amplifier. When this level \nshifted voltage (V SSE) starts to rise at time t 1 (see Figure 7-1 ), the output voltage the controller expects, rises as \nwell. Since V SSE starts at near 0 V, the controller attempts to regulate the output voltage from a starting point of \nzero volts. It cannot do this due to the converter architecture. The output voltage starts from the input voltage \nless the drop across the diode (V IN - V D) and rises from there. The point at which the output voltage starts to rise \n(t2) is the point where the V SSE ramp passes the point where it is commanding more output voltage than (V IN - \nVD). This voltage level is labeled V SSE(1) . The time required for the output voltage to ramp from a theoretical zero \nto the final regulated value (from t 1 to t 3) is determined by the time it takes for the capacitor connected to the SS \npin (C SS) to rise through a 700-mV range, beginning at V SS(ofst)  above GND.\nVSSE(1)VSS\nVOUTVSSEVSS(ofst)\nt0t1VSS(ofst)+700 mV\nVIN- VD\nt2t3\nFigure 7-1.

Also note the \ntolerance on R SS(chg)  given in the Section 6.5. This contributes to some variability in the output voltage rise time \nand margin must be applied to account for it in design.\nAlso take note of V BP. Its value varies depending on input conditions. For example, a converter operating from \na slowly rising input initializes V BP at a fairly low value and increases during the entire startup sequence. If the \ncontroller has a voltage above 8 V at the input and the DIS pin is used to stop and then restart the converter, V BP \nis approximately 8 V for the entire start-up sequence. The higher the voltage on BP, the shorter the start-up time \nis and conversely, the lower the voltage on BP, the longer the start-up time is.\nThe soft-start time (t SS) must be chosen long enough so that the converter can start up without going into \nan overcurrent state. Since the over current state is triggered by sensing the peak voltage on the ISNS pin, \nthat voltage must be kept below the overcurrent threshold voltage V ISNS(oc) . The voltage on the ISNS pin is a \nfunction of the load current of the converter, the rate of rise of the output voltage and the output capacitance, \nand the current sensing resistor. The total output current that must be supported by the converter is the sum \nof the charging current required by the output capacitor and any external load that must be supplied during \nstart-up. This current must be less than the I OUT(oc)  value used in Equation 15  or Equation 16  (depending on the \noperating mode of the converter) to determine the current sense resistor value. In these equations, the actual \ninput voltage at the time that the controller reaches the final output voltage is the important input voltage to use \nin the calculations. If the input voltage is slowly rising and is at less than the nominal input voltage when the \nstart-up time ends, the output current limit is less than I OUT(oc)  at the nominal input voltage. The output capacitor \ncharging current must be reduced (decrease C OUT or increase the t SS) or I OUT(oc)  must be increased and a new \nvalue for R ISNS calculated.\nI =C(chg)C V\ntOUT OUT\nSS/c180\n(2)\nt >SSC V\n(I I )OUT OUT\nOUT(oc) EXT /c45/c180\n(3)\nwhere\n•IC(chg)  is the output capacitor charging current in A\n•COUT is the total output capacitance in F\n•VOUT is the output voltage in V\n•tSS is the soft-start time from Equation 1\n•IOUT(oc)  is the desired over current trip point in A\n•IEXT is any external load current in A\nwww.ti.comTPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\nThe capacitor on the SS pin (C SS) also plays a role in overcurrent functionality. It is used as the timer between \nrestart attempts. The SS pin is connected to GND through a resistor, R SS(dchg) , whenever the controller senses \nan overcurrent condition. Switching stops and nothing else happens until the SS pin discharges to the soft-start \nreset threshold, V SS(rst) . At this point, the SS pin capacitor is allowed to charge again through the charging \nresistor R SS(chg) , and the controller restarts from that point. The shortest time between restart attempts occurs \nwhen the SS pin discharges from V SS(ofst)  (approximately 700 mV) to V SS(rst)  (150 mV) and then back to V SS(ofst) \nand switching resumes. In actuality, this is a conservative estimate since switching does not resume until the \nVSSE ramp rises to a point where it is commanding more output voltage than exists at the output of the controller. \nThis occurs at some SS pin voltage greater than V SS(ofst)  and depends on the voltage that remains on the output \novervoltage the converter while switching has been halted.

Soft Start during Overcurrent\n7.3.2 BP Regulator\nThe TPS40210 and TPS40211 have an on-board linear regulator that supplies power to the internal circuitry of \nthe controller, including the gate driver. This regulator has a nominal output voltage of 8 V and must be bypassed \nwith a 1- μF capacitor. If the voltage at the VDD pin is less than 8 V, the voltage on the BP pin will also be less \nand the gate drive voltage to the external FET is reduced from the nominal 8 V. This should be considered when \nchoosing a FET for the converter.\nConnecting external loads to this regulator can be done, but care must be taken to ensure that the thermal rating \nof the device is observed since there is no thermal shutdown feature in this controller. Exceeding the thermal \nratings causes out of specification behavior and can lead to reduced reliability. The controller dissipates more TPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\n www.ti.com\n14 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\npower when there is an external load on the BP pin and is tested for dropout voltage for up to 5-mA load. When \nthe controller is in the disabled state, the BP pin regulator also shuts off so loads connected there power down \nas well. When the controller is disabled with the DIS/ EN pin, this regulator is turned off.\nThe total power dissipation in the controller can be calculated as follows.

Pulling this pin above 1.2 V causes \nthe controller to completely shut down and enter a low current consumption state. In this state, the regulator \nconnected to the BP pin is turned off. There is an internal 1.1-M Ω pulldown resistor connected to this pin that \nkeeps the pin at GND level when left floating. If this function is not used in an application, it is best to connect \nthis pin to GND.\n7.3.4 Minimum On-Time and Off-Time Considerations\nThe TPS40210 has a minimum off-time of approximately 200 ns and a minimum on-time of 300 ns. These two \nconstraints place limitations on the operating frequency that can be used for a given input-to-output conversion \nratio. See Figure 6-2  for the maximum frequency that can be used for a given duty cycle.\nThe duty cycle at which the converter operates is dependent on the mode in which the converter is running. If \nthe converter is running in discontinuous conduction mode, the duty cycle varies with changes to the load much \nmore than it does when running in continuous conduction mode.\nIn continuous conduction mode, the duty cycle is related primarily to the input and output voltages.\nOUT D\nINV V 1\nV 1 D/c43/c61/c45\n(10)\nIN\nOUT DVD 1V V/c230 /c246/c230 /c246/c61 /c45/c231 /c247/c231 /c247/c231 /c247 /c43/c232 /c248/c232 /c248\n(11)\nIn discontinuous mode, the duty cycle is a function of the load, input and output voltages, inductance, and \nswitching frequency.\nwww.ti.comTPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41fOUT D OUT SW\n2\nIN2 V V I LD\nV/c180 /c43 /c180 /c180 /c180/c61(12)\nAll converters using a diode as the freewheeling or catch component have a load current level at which they \ntransition from discontinuous conduction to continuous conduction. This is the point where the inductor current \njust falls to zero. At higher load currents, the inductor current does not fall to zero but remains flowing in a \npositive direction and assumes a trapezoidal wave shape as opposed to a triangular wave shape.

Resistor values should \nbe limited to between 100 k Ω and 1 M Ω as well. If the resistor value falls below 100 k Ω, decrease the capacitor \nsize and recalculate the resistor value for the desired frequency. As the capacitor size decreases below 47 pF, \nthe accuracy of Equation 14  degrades and empirical means can be needed to fine tune the timing component \nvalues to achieve the desired switching frequency.\n7.3.6 Synchronizing the Oscillator\nThe TPS40210 and TPS40211 can be synchronized to an external clock source. Figure 7-4  shows the functional \ndiagram of the oscillator. When synchronizing the oscillator to an external clock, the RC pin must be pulled below \n150 mV for 20 ns or more. The external clock frequency must be higher than the free running frequency of \nthe converter as well. When synchronizing the controller, if the RC pin is held low for an excessive amount of \ntime, erratic operation can occur. The maximum amount of time that the RC pin should be held low is 50% of a \nnominal output pulse, or 10% of the period of the synchronization frequency. If the external clock signal cannot TPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\n www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\noperate with a low enough duty cycle to limit the amount of time the RC pin is held low, a resistor and capacitor \ncan be added at the gate of the synchronization MOSFET. The capacitor should be added in series with the gate \nof the MOSFET to AC couple the rising edge of the synchronization signal. The resistor should be added from \nthe gate of the MOSFET to ground to turn off the MOSFET. Typical values for the resistor and capacitor are 220 \npF and 1 kΩ.\nUnder circumstances where the duty cycle is less than 50%, a Schottky diode connected from the RC pin to \nan external clock can be used to synchronize the oscillator. The cathode of the diode is connected to the RC \npin. The trip point of the oscillator is set by an internal voltage divider to be 1/20 of the input voltage. The clock \nsignal must have an amplitude higher than this trip point. When the clock goes low, it allows the reset current to \nrestart the RC ramp, synchronizing the oscillator to the external clock. This provides a simple, single-component \nmethod for clock synchronization.\n+\n1RC\n150 mVS Q\nQR\n+\n+8\n5VDD\nGNDRRC\nCRCCLK\nExternal Frequency\nSynchronization\n(optional)VIN\nTPS40210/11\nUDG-08063\nFigure 7-4.

The device enters a current limit \nstate if the voltage on the ISNS pin exceeds the current limit threshold voltage V ISNS(oc)  from the Section 6.5. \nWhen this happens, the controller discharges the SS capacitor through a relatively high impedance and then \nattempts to restart. The amount of output current that causes this to happen is dependent on several variables in \nthe converter.\n10\n1\n6TPS40210/11\nVDD\nRC\nGNDCTRT\nUDG-07119\nFigure 7-6.

If the input voltage is slowly rising, the converter might have less than its designed \nnominal input voltage available when it has reached regulation. As a result, this can decrease the apparent \ncurrent limit load current value and must be taken into consideration when selecting R ISNS. The value of V IN \nused to calculate R ISNS must be the value at which the converter finishes start-up. The total converter output \ncurrent at start-up is the sum of the external load current and the current required to charge the output capacitor \nor capacitors. See the Section 7.3.1  section of this data sheet for information on calculating the required output \ncapacitor charging current.\nThe topology of the standard boost converter has no method to limit current from the input to the output in the \nevent of a short circuit fault on the output of the converter. If protection from this type of event is desired, it is \nnecessary to use some secondary protection scheme, such as a fuse, or rely on the current limit of the upstream \npower source.\n7.3.8 Current Sense and Subharmonic Instability\nA characteristic of peak current mode control results in a condition where the current control loop can exhibit \ninstability. This results in alternating long and short pulses from the pulse width modulator. The voltage loop \nmaintains regulation and does not oscillate, but the output ripple voltage increases. The condition occurs only \nwhen the converter is operating in continuous conduction mode and the duty cycle is 50% or greater. The \ncause of this condition is described in the Modeling, Analysis and Compensation of the Current-Mode Converter \nApplication Report . The remedy for this condition is to apply a compensating ramp from the oscillator to the \nsignal going to the pulse width modulator. In the TPS40210 and TPS40211, the oscillator ramp is applied in a \nfixed amount to the pulse width modulator. The slope of the ramp is given in Equation 17 .\nfVDD\ne SWVs20/c230 /c246/c61 /c180 /c231 /c247/c232 /c248\n(17)\nTo ensure that the converter does not enter into subharmonic instability, the slope of the compensating ramp \nsignal must be at least half of the down slope of the current ramp signal. Since the compensating ramp is fixed in \nthe TPS40210 and TPS40211, this places a constraint on the selection of the current sense resistor.\nThe down slope of the current sense wave form at the pulse width modulator is described in Equation 18 .\nwww.ti.comTPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n/c40 /c41 CS ISNS OUT D INA R V V Vm2L/c180 /c180 /c43 /c45/c61(18)\nSince the slope compensation ramp must be at least half, and preferably equal to the down slope of the current \nsense waveform seen at the pulse width modulator, a maximum value is placed on the current sense resistor \nwhen operating in continuous mode at 50% duty cycle or greater. For design purposes, some margin should be \napplied to the actual value of the current sense resistor. As a starting point, the actual resistor chosen should \nbe 80% or less that the value calculated in Equation 19 . This equation calculates the resistor value that makes \nthe slope compensation ramp equal to one half of the current ramp downslope. Values no more than 80% of this \nresult would be acceptable.\n/c40 /c41fVDD SW\nISNS(max)\nOUT D INV LR60 V V V/c180 /c180/c61/c180 /c43 /c45\n(19)\nwhere\n•Se is the slope of the voltage compensating ramp applied to the pulse width modulator in V/s\n•f SW is the switching frequency in Hz\n•VDD is the voltage at the VDD pin in V\n•m2 is the down slope of the current sense waveform seen at the pulse width modulator in V/s\n•RISNS is the value of the current sense resistor in Ω\n•VOUT is the converter output voltage V IN is the converter power stage input voltage\n•VD is the drop across the diode in Figure 7-7\nIt is possible to increase the voltage compensation ramp slope by connecting the VDD pin to the output voltage \nof the converter instead of the input voltage as shown in Figure 7-7 . This can help in situations where the \nconverter design calls for a large ripple current value in relation to the desired output current limit setting.\nNote\nConnecting the VDD pin to the output voltage of the converter affects the start-up voltage of the \nconverter since the controller undervoltage lockout (UVLO) circuit monitors the VDD pin and senses \nthe input voltage less the diode drop before start-up. The effect is to increase the start-up voltage by \nthe value of the diode voltage drop.\nIf an acceptable R ISNS value is not available, the next higher value can be used and the signal from the resistor \ndivided down to an acceptable level by placing another resistor in parallel with C IFLT.\n7.3.9 Current Sense Filtering\nIn most cases, a small filter placed on the ISNS pin improves performance of the converter. These are the \ncomponents R IFLT and C IFLT in Figure 7-7 . The time constant of this filter should be approximately 10% of the \nnominal pulse width of the converter.

Higher values can be used but this raises \nthe impedance of the ISNS pin connection more than necessary and can lead to noise pickup issues in some \nlayouts. C IFLT should be located as close as possible to the ISNS pin as well to provide noise immunity.TPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\n www.ti.com\n20 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n7.3.10 Control Loop Considerations\nThere are two methods to design a suitable control loop for the TPS4021x.

Basic Compensation Network\nThe natural phase characteristics of most capacitors used for boost outputs combined with the current mode \ncontrol provide adequate phase margin when using this type of compensation. To determine an initial starting \npoint for the compensation, the desired crossover frequency must be considered when estimating the control to \noutput gain. The model used is a current source into the output capacitor and load.\nWhen using these equations, the loop bandwidth should be no more than 20% of the switching frequency, f SW. \nA more reasonable loop bandwidth would be 10% of the switching frequency. Be sure to evaluate the transient \nresponse of the converter over the expected load range to ensure acceptable operation.\n/c40 /c41 CO M OUT COK g Z /c61 /c180 f\n(22)\n/c40 /c41 /c40 /c41SW\nOUT\nM2\nISNS ISNS SW0.13 LRg\nR 120 R L/c180 /c180\n/c61\n/c180 /c180 /c43 /c180f\nf\n(23)\nwww.ti.comTPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\nCopyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41 /c40 /c41/c40 /c41 /c40 /c412\nL ESR OUT\nOUT OUT2 2 2\nOUT OUT ESR ESR L OUT1 2 f R C\nZ R\n1 R 2 R R R 2 f C/c43 /c112 /c180 /c180 /c180\n/c61 /c180\n/c43 /c43 /c180 /c180 /c43 /c180 /c112 /c180 /c180(24)\nwhere\n•KCO is the control to output gain of the converter, in V/V\n•gM is the transconductance of the power stage and modulator, in S\n•ROUT is the output load equivalent resistance, in Ω\n•ZOUT is the output impedance, including the output capacitor, in Ω\n•RISNS is the value of the current sense resistor, in Ω\n•L is the value of the inductor, in H\n•COUT is the value of the output capacitance, in F\n•RESR is the equivalent series resistance of C OUT, in Ω\n•fSW is the switching frequency, in Hz\n•fL is the desired crossover frequency for the control loop, in Hz\nThese equations assume that the operation is discontinuous and that the load is purely resistive.

The typical VDD UVLO threshold is 4.25 \nV and the device can operate at input voltages down to the UVLO voltage. At input voltages below the actual \nUVLO voltage, the device will not switch. When V VDD passes the UVLO threshold the device will become active. \nSwitching is enabled and the soft-start sequence is initiated. The TPS4021x will ramp up the output voltage at \nthe rate determined by the external capacitor at the SS pin.\n7.4.2 Operation With DIS/ EN Pin\nThe DIS/ EN pin has a 1.2-V typical threshold which can be used to disable the TPS4021x. With DIS/ EN forced \nabove this threshold voltage, the device is disabled and switching is inhibited even if V VDD is above its UVLO \nthreshold. Hysteresis on the DIS/ EN pin threshold gives a typical turnon threshold of 1.05 V. If the DIS/ EN is \nleft floating or is pulled below the 1.05-V threshold while V VDD is above its UVLO threshold, the device becomes \nactive. Switching is enabled and the soft-start sequence is initiated. The TPS4021x will ramp up the output \nvoltage at the rate determined by the external capacitor at the soft-start pin.TPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\n www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness.

For a 24-V output, a high feedback \nresistance is desirable to limit power dissipation so R FB = 51.1 kΩ is selected.\nFB FB\nBIAS\nOUT FBV R 0.700 V 51.1kR 1.53kV V 24 V 0.700 V/c180 /c180 /c87/c61 /c61 /c61 /c87/c45 /c45\n(57)\nRBIAS = 1.50 kΩ is selected.\n8.2.1.2.11 Error Amplifier Compensation\nCompensation selection can be done with aid of WEBENCH to select compensation components or with the \naid of the average Spice model to simulate the open loop modulator and power stage gain. Alternatively, the \nfollowing procedure gives a good starting point.\nWhile current mode control typically only requires Type II compensation, it is desirable to layout for Type III \ncompensation to increase flexibility during design and development. Current mode control boost converters have \nhigher gain with higher output impedance, so it is necessary to calculate the control loop gain at the maximum \noutput impedance, estimated by Equation 58 .\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41OUT\nOUT max\nOUT minV 24 VR 240I 0.1A/c61 /c61 /c61 /c87\n(58)\nThe transconductance of the TPS40210 current mode control can be estimated by Equation 59 .\n/c40 /c41 /c40 /c41 /c40 /c41 /c40 /c41SW\nOUT\nM2 2\nISNS ISNS SW600kHz0.13 L 0.13 10 HR 240 Ag 19.2V12m 120 12m 10 H 600kHz R 120 R L/c180 /c180 /c180 /c109 /c180/c87/c61 /c61 /c61\n/c87 /c180 /c180 /c87 /c43 /c109 /c180 /c180 /c180 /c43 /c180f\nf\n(59)\nThe maximum output impedance Z OUT, can be estimated by Equation 60 .\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41 /c40 /c41/c40 /c41 /c40 /c41f2\nESR OUT\nOUT OUT2 2 2\nOUT OUT ESR ESR OUT1 2 f R C\nZ ( ) R\n1 R 2 R R R 2 f C/c43 /c112 /c180 /c180 /c180\n/c61 /c180\n/c43 /c43 /c180 /c180 /c43 /c180 /c112 /c180 /c180\n(60)\n/c40 /c41/c40 /c41/c40 /c41\n/c40 /c41 /c40 /c41/c40 /c41 /c40 /c412\nfOUT L2 2 21 2 30kHz 60m 39.8 F\nZ 240 0.146\n1 240 2 240 60m 60m 2 30kHz 39.8 F/c43 /c112 /c180 /c180 /c87 /c180 /c109\n/c61 /c87 /c180 /c61 /c87\n/c43 /c87 /c43 /c180 /c87 /c180 /c87 /c43 /c87 /c180 /c112 /c180 /c180 /c109\n(61)TPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\n www.ti.com\n30 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\nAt the desired crossover frequency (f L) of 30 kHz, Z OUT becomes 0.146 Ω.\nThe modulator gain at the desired cross-over can be estimated by Equation 62 .\n/c40 /c41 CO M OUT COA K g Z 19.2 0.146 2.80V/c61 /c180 /c61 /c180 /c87 /c61 f\n(62)\nThe feedback compensation network needs to be designed to provide an inverse gain at the cross-over \nfrequency for unity loop gain.

This input \nsupply should remain within the input voltage range of the TPS4021x. If the input supply is located more than a \nfew inches from the buck power stage controlled by the TPS4021x, additional bulk capacitance can be required \nin addition to ceramic-bypass capacitors. An electrolytic capacitor with a value of 100 µF is a typical choice.TPS40210, TPS40211\nSLUS772G – MARCH 2008 – REVISED JUNE 2020\n www.ti.com\n36 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2023 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS40210  TPS40211\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\n•For the maximum effectiveness from C9, place it near the VDD pin of the controller. Excessive high frequency \nnoise on VDD during switching degrades overall regulation as the load increases.\n•Keep the output loop (Q1-D1-C12-R11) as small as possible. A larger loop can degrade current limit accuracy \nand increase rediated emissions.\n•For best current limit accuracy keep the ISNS filter components C10 and R10 near the ISNS and GND pins.\n•Avoid connecting traces carrying large AC currents through a ground plane. Instead, use PCB traces on the \ntop layer to conduct the AC current and use the ground plane as a noise shield.\n•Split the ground plane as necessary to keep noise away from the TPS4021x and noise sensitive areas such \nas components connected to the RC pin, FB pin, COMP pin, and SS pin. Also keep these noise sensitive \ncomponents close to the TPS4021x IC.\n•Keep C7 near the BP and GND pins to provide good bypass for the BP regulator.\n•The GDRV trace should be as close as possible to the power FET gate to minimize parisitic resistance and \ninductance in the trace. The parasitics should also be minimized in the return path from the source of the \nMOSFET, through the sense resistor and back to the GND pin.\n•Keep the SW node as physically small as possible to minimize parasitic capacitance and radiated emissions.\n•For good output voltage regulation, Kelvin connections should be brought from the load to the top FB resistor \nR7.\n10.2 Layout Example\nFigure 10-1.
