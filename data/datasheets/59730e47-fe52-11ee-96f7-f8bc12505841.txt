Precautions for Use \nThis product is for use only with reflow soldering. It is des igned to be mounted by soldering. If you want to use other \nmounting method, for example, using a conductive adhesive, please consult us beforehand. \nAlso, if repeatedly subjected to temperatur e cycles or other thermal stress, due to th e difference in the coefficient of therma l \nexpansion with the mounting substrate, the solder (sol der fillet part) in the mounting part may crack. \nThe occurrence of cracks due to thermal stress is affected by  the size of the land where mounted, the solder volume, and \nthe heat dissipation of the mounting substrat e. Carefully design it when a large chan ge in ambient temperature is assumed. \n   \nWDLabel\nH\nSpec No.: JELF243A_0024AA-01 P8/12 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.1 Land dimensions \nThe following diagram shows the recommended land dimensions for reflow soldering. \nThe land dimensions are designed in consideration of electr ical characteristics and mountability. Use of other land \ndimensions may preclude achievement of performance. In some case s, it may result in poor sol derability, including positional \nshift.

Cooling into solvent after soldering also should be in such a way that the temperature difference is limited to 100°C max. \nInsufficient pre-heating may cause cracks on the produc t, resulting in the deterioration of product quality. \n• Standard soldering profile and the limit  soldering profile is as follows. \nThe excessive limit soldering conditions may cause leaching of the electrode and/or resulting in the deterioration of product \nquality. \n \n Standard profile Limit profile \nPre-heating 150°C to 180°C/90 s±30 s 150°C to 180°C/90 s±30 s \nHeating Above 220°C/30 s to 60 s Above 230°C/60 s max. \nPeak temperature  245°C±3°C 260°C/10 s \nNumber of reflow cycles 2 times 2 times \n  \nLimit Profile\nStandard Profile\n90s±30s230℃260℃\n245℃±3℃\n220℃\n30s～60s\n60s max.180\n150Temp.\n(s)(℃)\nTime.\nSpec No.: JELF243A_0024AA-01 P9/12 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.4 Reworking with soldering iron \nThe following requirements must be met to rework  a soldered product using a soldering iron. \nItem Requirement \nPre-heating 150°C/approx. 1 min \nTip temperature of soldering iron 350°C max. \nPower consumption of so ldering iron 80 W max. \nTip diameter of soldering iron ø3 mm max. \nSoldering time 3 s (+1 s, -0 s) \nNumber of reworking operations 2 times max. \n* Avoid a direct contact of the tip of the soldering iron with the product. Such a \ndirection contact may cause cracks in the ceramic body due to thermal shock. \n12.5 Solder volume \nSolder shall be used not to increase the volume too much. \n \nAn increased solder volume increases mechanical stress on t he product. Exceeding solder volume may cause the failure of \nmechanical or electrical performance. \n12.6 Product\'s location \nThe following shall be considered when designing and laying out PCBs. \n(1) PCB shall be designed so that pr oducts are not subject to mechanical stress due to warping the board. \n[Products direction] \nProducts shall be located in the sideways direct ion (length: a < b) to the mechanical stress. \n \n(2) Components location on PCB separation \nIt is effective to implement the following measur es, to reduce stress in separating the board. \nIt is best to implement all of the following three measures; ho wever, implement as many measures as possible to reduce \nstress. \nContents of measures  Stress level  \n(1) Turn the mounting direction of  the component parallel to the \nboard separation surface.  A > D*1 \n(2) Add slits in the board separation part.  A > B \n(3) Keep the mounting position of the component away from the \nboard separation surface.  A > C \n*1 A > D is valid when stress is added vertical ly to the perforation as with hand separation. \nIf a cutting disc is used, stress will be diago nal to the PCB, therefore A > D is invalid. \n \n  \n \n〈Poor example 〉 〈Good example 〉ba\n\nSpec No.: JELF243A_0024AA-01 P10/12 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD (3) Mounting components near screw holes \nWhen a component is mounted near a screw hole, it may be affected by the board deflec tion that occurs during the \ntightening of the screw. \nMount the component in a position as far away from the screw holes as possible. \n \n12.7 Handling of substrate \nAfter mounting products on a substrate, do not apply any stress to the product caused by bending or twisting to the substrate \nwhen cropping the substrate, inserting and removing a connector from the substrate or tighteni ng screw to the substrate. \nExcessive mechanical stress may cause cracking in the product. \n  \nBending Twisting \n12.8 Cleaning \nThe product shall be cleaned under the following conditions. \n(1) The cleaning temperature shall be 60°C max. If isopropyl al cohol (IPA) is used, the cleaning temperature shall be 40°C \nmax. \n(2) Perform ultrasonic cleaning under the following conditi ons. Exercise caution to prevent resonance phenomenon in \nmounted products and the PCB. \nItem Requirement \nPower 20 W/L max. \nTime 5 min max. \nFrequency 28 kHz to 40 kHz \n(3) Cleaner \nAlcohol-based cleaner: IPA \nAqueous agent: PINE ALPHA ST-100S \n(4) There shall be no residual flux or residual cleaner. Wh en using aqueous agent, rinse the product with deionized water \nadequately and completely dry it so that no cleaner is left. \n* For other cleaning, consul t our technical department. \n12.9 Storage and transportation \nStorage period Use the product within 12 months after delivery.  \nIf you do not use the product for more than 12 months, check solderability before using it. \nStorage conditions • The products shall be stored in a ro om not subject to rapid changes  in temperature and humidity. \nThe recommended temperature range is -10°C to +40°C. The recommended relative humidity \nrange is 15% to 85%. Keeping the product in corrosive gases, such as  sulfur, chlorine gas or acid, oxidizes the \nelectrode, resulting in poor so lderability or corrosion of t he coil wire of the product. \n• Do not keep products in bulk packaging. Doing so may cause collision between the products or \nbetween the products and other products, resulting in core chipping or wire breakage. \n• Do not place the products directly on the floor; t hey should be placed on a palette so that they are \nnot affected by humidity or dust. \n• Avoid keeping the products in a place expos ed to direct sunlight, heat or vibration. \nTransportation Excessive vibration and impact reduces the reliability of the products. Exercise caution when \nhandling the products. \n  \n\nSpec No.: JELF243A_0024AA-01 P11/12 \nMURATA MFG CO., LTD 12.10 Resin coating \nThe inductance value may change due to high cure-stress of resin to be used for coating/molding products. \nA wire breakage issue may occur by mechanical stress caused by the resin, amount/cured shape of resin, or operating \ncondition etc. Some resin contains some impurities or chlo ride possible to generate chlorine by hydrolysis under some \noperating condition may cause corrosion of wire of coil, leading to wire breakage. \nSo, please pay your careful attention when you select resin in case of coating/molding the products with the resin. \nPrior to use the coating resin, please make sure no reliabi lity issue is observed by evaluating products mounted on your \nboard. \n12.11 Handling of product \n• Sharp material such as a pair of tweezers  or other material such as bristles of  cleaning brush, shall not be touched to the \nwinding portion to prevent the breaking of wire. \n• Mechanical shock should not be applied to the products m ounted on the board to prevent the breaking of the core. \n12.12 Handling with mounting equipment \n• With some types of mounting equipment, a support pin pushes  up the product from the bottom of the base (paper) tape \nwhen the product is sucked with the pick-up nozzle. \nWhen using this type of equipment, detach the suppor t pin to prevent the breaking of wire on the product. \n• In some cases, the laser recognition function of the moun ting equipment may not recognize this product correctly. \nPlease contact us when using laser recognition. (There is  no problem with the permea tion and reflection type.) \n13. \n Note \n(1) Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in vi ew of your specifications with our product being mounted to \nyour product. \n(2) You are requested not to use our product deviating from the reference specifications. \n(3) The contents of this reference specification are subjec t to change without advance notice.
