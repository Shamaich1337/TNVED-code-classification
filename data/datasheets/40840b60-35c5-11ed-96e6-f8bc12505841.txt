At moderate\nto heavy load currents, the device operates in pulse width modulation (PWM), and at light load currents, the device\nenters power save mode operation using pulse frequency modulation (PFM). When operating in PWM mode, the\ntypical switching frequency is 1.25 MHz with a minimum switching frequency of 1 MHz. This makes the devicesuitable for xDSL applications minimizing RF (radio frequency) interference.\nDuring PWM operation the converter uses a unique fast response voltage mode controller scheme with input voltage\nfeed−forward to achieve good line and load regulation, allowing the use of small ceramic input and output capacitors.\nAt the beginning of each clock cycle initiated by the clock signal (S) the P-channel MOSFET switch turns on and the\ninductor current ramps up until the comparator trips and the control logic turns off the switch. The current limitcomparator also turns off the switch in case the current limit of the P-channel switch is exceeded. After the dead time\npreventing current shoot through, the N-channel MOSFET rectifier is turned on and the inductor current ramps down.\nThe next cycle is initiated by the clock signal, again turning off the N-channel rectifier and turning on the P-channel\nswitch.\nThe Gm amplifier as well as the input voltage determines the rise time of the saw tooth generator, and therefore, any\nchange in input voltage or output voltage directly controls the duty cycle of the converter, giving a very good line and\nload transient regulation.\nPOWER SAVE MODE OPERATION\nAs the load current decreases, the converter enters power save mode operation. During power save mode theconverter operates with reduced switching frequency in PFM mode and with a minimum quiescent currentmaintaining high efficiency.\nThe converter monitors the average inductor current and the device enters power save mode when the average\ninductor current is below the threshold. The transition point between PWM and power save mode is given by the\ntransition current with the following equation:\nItransition/C0043VI\n18.66 /C0087\nDuring power save mode the output voltage is monitored with the comparator by the threshold’s comp low and comp\nhigh. As the output voltage falls below the comp low threshold set to typically 0.8% above the nominal output voltage,\nthe P-channel switch turns on. The P-channel switch remains on until the transition current (1) is reached. Then the\nN-channel switch turns on completing the first cycle. The converter continues to switch with its normal duty cycledetermined by the input and output voltage but with half the nominal switching frequency of 625-kHz typ. Thus theoutput voltage rises and as soon as the output voltage reaches the comp high threshold of 1.6%, the converter stops\nswitching. Depending on the load current, the converter switches for a longer or shorter period of time in order to\ndeliver the energy to the output. If the load current increases and the output voltage can not be maintained with the\ntransition current , equation (1), the converter enters PWM again. See Figure 11 and Figure 12 under the typicalgraphs section and Figure 14 for power save mode operation. Among other techniques this advanced power save\nmode method allows high efficiency over the entire load current range and a small output ripple of typically 1% ofthe nominal output voltage.\nSetting the power save mode thresholds to typically 0.8% and 1.6% above the nominal output voltage at light load\ncurrent results in a dynamic voltage positioning achieving lower absolute voltage drops during heavy load transientchanges. This allows the converter to operate with small output capacitors like 22 µF and still having a low absolute\nvoltage drop during heavy load transient. Refer to Figure 14 as well for detailed operation of the power save mode.(1)\nTPS62040\nTPS62042, TPS62043\nTPS62044, TPS62046\nSLVS463B − JUNE 2003 − REVISED OCTOBER 2005www.ti.com\n111.6%\n0.8%\nVOComp High\nComp Low\nComp Low 2\nPWM Mode at Medium to Full LoadPFM Mode at Light Load\nFigure 14. Power Save Mode Thresholds and Dynamic Voltage Positioning\nThe converter enters the fixed frequency PWM mode as soon as the output voltage falls below the comp low 2\nthreshold.\nDYNAMIC VOLTAGE POSITIONING\nAs described in the power save mode operation sections before and as detailed in Figure 14  the output voltage is\ntypically 0.8% (i.e., 1% on average) above the nominal output voltage at light load currents, as the device is in power\nsave mode. This gives additional headroom for the voltage drop during a load transient from light load to full load.\nIn the other direction during a load transient from full load to light load the voltage overshoot is also minimized byturning on the N-Channel rectifier switch to pull the output voltage actively down.\nMODE (AUTOMATIC PWM/PFM OPERATION AND FORCED PWM OPERATION)\nConnecting the MODE pin to GND enables the automatic PWM and power save mode operation. The converteroperates in fixed frequency PWM mode at moderate to heavy loads and in the PFM mode during light loads,maintaining high efficiency over a wide load current range.\nPulling the MODE pin high forces the converter to operate constantly in the PWM mode even at light load currents.\nThe advantage is the converter operates with a fixed switching frequency that allows simple filtering of the switchingfrequency for noise sensitive applications. In this mode, the efficiency is lower compared to the power save modeduring light loads (see Figure 1 to Figure 3). For additional flexibility it is possible to switch from power save modeto forced PWM mode during operation. This allows efficient power management by adjusting the operation of the\nTPS6204x to the specific system requirements.\n100% DUTY CYCLE LOW DROPOUT OPERATION\nThe TPS6204x offers a low input to output voltage dif ference while still maintaining regulation with the use of the 100%\nduty cycle mode. In this mode, the P −Channel switch is constantly turned on. This is particularly useful in battery\npowered applications to achieve longest operation time by taking full advantage of the whole battery voltage range.\ni.e. The minimum input voltage to maintain regulation depends on the load current and output voltage and can becalculated as:\nVImin/C0043VOmax/C0041IOmax/C0032/C0466rDS(on)max/C0041RL/C0467\nwith:\nIO(max) = maximum output current plus inductor ripple current\nrDS(on) max= maximum P-channel switch t DS(on) .\nRL = DC resistance of the inductor\nVOmax = nominal output voltage plus maximum output voltage tolerance(2)\nTPS62040\nTPS62042, TPS62043\nTPS62044, TPS62046\nSLVS463B − JUNE 2003 − REVISED OCTOBER 2005www.ti.com\n12SOFTSTART\nThe TPS6204x series has an internal softstart circuit that limits the inrush current during start up. This prevents\npossible voltage drops of the input voltage in case a battery or a high impedance power source is connected to the\ninput of the TPS6204x.\nThe softstart is implemented with a digital circuit increasing the switch current in steps of typically I LIM/8, ILIM/4, ILIM/2\nand then the typical switch current limit 1.85 A as specified in the electrical parameter table. The start-up time mainlydepends on the output capacitor and load current, see Figure 13.\nSHORT-CIRCUIT PROTECTION\nAs soon as the output voltage falls below 50% of the nominal output voltage, the converter switching frequency aswell as the current limit is reduced to 50% of the nominal value. Since the short-circuit protection is enabled duringstart-up, the device does not deliver more than half of its nominal current limit until the output voltage exceeds 50%\nof the nominal output voltage. This needs to be considered in case a load acting as a current sink is connected to\nthe output of the converter.\nTHERMAL SHUTDOWN\nAs soon as the junction temperature of typically 150 /C0095C is exceeded the device goes into thermal shutdown. In this\nmode, the P-Channel switch and N-Channel rectifier are turned off. The device continues its operation when the\njunction temperature falls below typically 150 °C again.\nENABLE\nPulling the EN low forces the part into shutdown mode, with a shutdown current of typically 0.1 µA. In this mode, the\nP-Channel switch and N-Channel rectifier are turned off and the whole device is in shut down. If an output voltage\nis present during shut down, which could be an external voltage source or super cap, the reverse leakage currentis specified under electrical parameter table. For proper operation the enable (EN) pin must be terminated and should\nnot be left floating.\nPulling EN high starts up the TPS6204x with the softstart as described under the section Softstart.\nUNDERVOLTAGE LOCKOUT\nThe undervoltage lockout circuit prevents device misoperation at low input voltages. It prevents the converter from\nturning on the switch or rectifier MOSFET with undefined conditions.\nTPS62040\nTPS62042, TPS62043\nTPS62044, TPS62046\nSLVS463B − JUNE 2003 − REVISED OCTOBER 2005www.ti.com\n13APPLICATION INFORMATION\nADJUSTABLE OUTPUT VOLTAGE VERSION\nWhen the adjustable output voltage version TPS62040 is used, the output voltage is set by the external resistor\ndivider. See Figure 15.\nThe output voltage is calculated as:\nVO/C00430.5 V /C0032/C04661/C0041R1\nR2/C0467\nwith R1 + R2 ≤1 MΩ and internal reference voltage V ref typical = 0.5 V\nR1 + R2 should not be greater than 1 M Ω because of stability reasons. To keep the operating quiescent current to\na minimum, the feedback resistor divider should have high impedance with R1+R2 ≤1 MΩ. Due to this and the low\nreference voltage of V ref = 0.5 V, the noise on the feedback pin (FB) needs to be minimized. Using a capacitive divider\nC1 and C2 across the feedback resistors minimizes the noise at the feedback, without degrading the line or load\ntransient performance.\nC1 and C2 should be selected as:\nC1/C00431\n2/C0032/C0112/C003210 kHz /C0032R1\nwith:\nR1 = upper resistor of voltage dividerC1 = upper capacitor of voltage divider\nFor C1 a value should be chosen that comes closest to the calculated result.\nC2/C0043R1\nR2\n/C0032C1\nwith:\nR2 = lower resistor of voltage dividerC2 = lower capacitor of voltage divider\nFor C2, the selected capacitor value should always be selected larger than the calculated result. For example, in\nFigure 15 for C2 100 pF are selected for a calculated result of C2 = 88.42 pF.\nIf quiescent current is not a key design parameter C1 and C2 can be omitted, and a low impedance feedback divider\nhas to be used with R1 + R2 < 100 k Ω. This reduces the noise available on the feedback pin (FB) as well but increases\nthe overall quiescent current during operation. The higher the programmed output voltage the lower the feedbackimpedance has to be for best operation when not using C1 and C2.\nVIN\nVIN\nEN\nMODESW\nFB\nPGND\nPGNDSW\nGND2\n3\n1\n4910578\n6TPS62040\nC3\n10 µFVI\n2.5 V to 6 VL1\n10 µH\nC4\n10 µFVO\n1.8 V / 1.2 A\nR1\n470 k Ω\nR2\n180 k ΩC1\n33 pF\nC2\n100 pF\nFigure 15.

Larger or smaller inductor values can be used to optimize\nthe performance of the device for specific operation conditions. The selected inductor has to be rated for its dcresistance and saturation current. The dc resistance of the inductance directly influences the efficiency of theconverter. Therefore an inductor with the lowest dc resistance should be selected for highest efficiency.\nFormula (7) calculates the maximum inductor current under static load conditions. The saturation current of the\ninductor should be rated higher than the maximum inductor current as calculated with formula (7). This is needed\nbecause during heavy load transient the inductor current rises above the value calculated under (7).\n/C0068IL/C0043VO/C00321–VO\nVI\nL/C0032ƒ\nILmax/C0043IOmax/C0041/C0068IL\n2\nwith\nƒ = Switching frequency (1.25 MHz typical)\nL = Inductor value\n∆IL= Peak-to-peak inductor ripple current\nILmax = Maximum inductor current\nThe highest inductor current occurs at maximum V I.\nOpen core inductors have a soft saturation characteristic and they can usually handle higher inductor currents versus\na comparable shielded inductor. A more conservative approach is to select the inductor current rating just for the\nmaximum switch current of 2.2 A for the TPS6204x. Keep in mind that the core material from inductor to inductor\ndiffers and has an impact on the ef ficiency, especially at high switching frequencies. Refer to T able 1 and the typical\napplications and inductors selection.\nTable 1.

Ceramic capacitors having low ESR values have the lowest output voltage ripple and are recommended.If required, tantalum capacitors may also be used. Refer to Table 2 for component selection.\nIf ceramic output capacitor are used, the capacitor RMS ripple current rating always meets the application\nrequirements. Just for completeness the RMS ripple current is calculated as:\nIRMSCout/C0043VO/C00321–VO\nVI\nL/C0032ƒ/C00321\n2/C00323/C0504\nAt nominal load current the device operates in PWM mode and the overall output voltage ripple is the sum of the\nvoltage spike caused by the output capacitor ESR plus the voltage ripple caused by charging and discharging the\noutput capacitor:\n/C0068VO/C0043VO/C00321–VO\nVI\nL/C0032ƒ/C0032/C04661\n8/C0032CO/C0032ƒ/C0041ESR/C0467\nWhere the highest output voltage ripple occurs at the highest input voltage, V I.\nAt light load currents, the device operates in power save mode and the output voltage ripple is independent of the\noutput capacitor value. The output voltage ripple is set by the internal comparator thresholds. The typical outputvoltage ripple is 1% of the nominal output voltage.\nInput Capacitor Selection\nBecause of the nature of the buck converter having a pulsating input current, a low ESR input capacitor is required\nfor best input voltage filtering and minimizing the interference with other circuits caused by high input voltage spikes.\nThe input capacitor should have a minimum value of 22 µF. The input capacitor can be increased without any limit\nfor better input voltage filtering.\nTable 2.

If the layout is not carefully done, the regulator might show stability problems as well as EMI\nproblems. Therefore, use wide and short traces for the main current paths as indicated in bold in Figure 16. Thesetraces should be routed first. The input capacitor should be placed as close as possible to the IC pins as well as the\ninductor and output capacitor. The feedback resistor network should be routed away from the inductor and switchnode to minimize noise and magnetic interference. To further minimize noise from coupling into the feedback network\nand feedback pin, the ground plane or ground traces should be used for shielding. A common ground plane or a star\nground as shown below should be used. This becomes very important especially at high switching frequencies of1.25 MHz.\nVIN\nVIN\nEN\nMODESW\nFB\nPGND\nPGNDSW\nGND2\n3\n1\n4910578\n6TPS6204x\nC3\n22 µFVIL1\n10 µH\nC2\n22 µFVOThe Switch Node Must Be\nKept as Small as Possible\nFigure 16. Layout Diagram\nTHERMAL INFORMATION\nOne of the most influential components on the thermal performance of a package is board design. In order to take\nfull advantage of the heat dissipating abilities of the PowerPAD /C0116 packages, a board should be used that acts similar\nto a heat sink and allows for the use of the exposed (and solderable), deep downset pad. For further informationplease refer to Texas Instruments application note (SLMA002) PowerPAD Thermally Enhanced Package .\nThe PowerPAD /C0116 of the 10-pin MSOP package has an area of 1,52 mm × 1,79 mm ( ± 0,05 mm) and must be soldered\nto the PCB to lower the thermal resistance. Thermal vias to the next layer further reduce the thermal resistance.\nTPS62040\nTPS62042, TPS62043\nTPS62044, TPS62046\nSLVS463B − JUNE 2003 − REVISED OCTOBER 2005www.ti.com\n17TYPICAL APPLICATIONS\n7VIN\nVIN\nEN\nMODESW\nFB\nPGND\nPGNDSW\nGND2\n3\n1\n4 91058\n6TPS62046 VI\nLi-lonVO\n3.3 V / 1.2 A\nC2\n22 µFC1\n22 µFL1\n6.2 µH\nComponents:\nC1: Taiyo Yuden JMK316BJ226ML\nC2: Taiyo Yuden JMK316BJ226ML\nL1: Sumida CDRH5D28 −6R2\nFigure 17.
