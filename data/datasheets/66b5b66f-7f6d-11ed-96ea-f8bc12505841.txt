An additional evaluation is needed if the source \nis other than TNV -2 or SELV.  \n \nWhen the input source is  SELV circuit , the power module \nmeets SELV (safety extra -low voltage) requirements. If \nthe input source is a hazardous voltage which is greater \nthan 60 Vdc and less than or equal to 75 Vdc, for the \nmodule’s output to meet SELV requirements, all of the \nfollowing must be met:  \n\uf077 The input sourc e must be insulated from the ac \nmains by reinforced or double insulation.  \n\uf077 The input terminals of the module are not operator \naccessible.  \n\uf077 If the metal baseplate is grounded , one Vi pin and \none Vo pin shall also be grounded.  \n\uf077 A SELV reliability test is conduc ted on the system \nwhere the module is used , in combination with the \nmodule,  to ensure that under a single fault, \nhazardous voltage does not appear at the module’s \noutput.  \nWhen installed into a Class II equipment (without \ngrounding), spacing consideration s hould be given to the \nend-use installation, as the spacing between the module \nand mounting surface have not been evaluated.  \n \nThe power module has extra -low voltage (ELV) outputs \nwhen all inputs are ELV.  \nThis power module is not internally fused. To achieve  \noptimum safety and system protection, an input line fuse \nis highly recommended. The safety agencies require a \nnormal -blow fuse with 2 0A maximum rating to be \ninstalled in the ungrounded lead. A lower rated fuse can \nbe used based on the maximum inrush trans ient energy \nand maximum input current.  \n \nSoldering and Cleaning Considerations  \nPost solder cleaning is usually the final board assembly \nprocess before the board or system undergoes electrical \ntesting. Inadequate cleaning and/or drying may lower the \nreliabil ity of a power module and severely affect the \nfinished circuit board assembly test. Adequate cleaning \nand/or drying is especially important for un -encapsulated \nand/or open frame type power modules. For assistance \non appropriate soldering and cleaning proce dures, please \ncontact Delta’s technical support team.  DESIGN CONSIDERATION S \n \nInput Source Impedance  \nThe impedance of the input source connecting to the \nDC/DC power modules will interact with the modules and \naffect the stability. A low ac -impedance input s ource is \nrecommended. If the source inductance is more than a \nfew μH, we advise adding a 10 to 100 μF electrolytic \ncapacitor (ESR < 0.7 Ω at 100 kHz) mounted close to the \ninput of the module to improve the stability.  \n \nLayout and EMC Considerations  \nDelta’s DC/DC power modules are designed to operate \nin a wide variety of systems and applications. For design \nassistance with EMC compliance and related P WB \nlayout issues, please contact Delta’s technical support \nteam. An external input filter module is available for \neasier EMC compliance design.

When output drops below 50%, the \nmodules will automatically shut down and enter hiccup \nmode.   \n  \nDuring hiccup, the modules will try to restart after \nshutdown. If the overload condition sti ll exists, the \nmodule will shut down again. This restart trial will \ncontinue until the overload condition is corrected.  \n \nOver -Voltage Protection  \n \nThe modules include an internal output over -voltage \nprotection circuit, which monitors the voltage on the \noutput terminals. If this voltage exceeds the over -voltage \nset point, the module will shut down and restart after \n200mS. latch off mode is optional. Under latch off mode \nthe over -voltage latch is reset by either cycling the input \npower or by toggling the on/of f signal for one second.  \n \nOver -Temperature Protection  \n \nThe over -temperature protection consists of circuitry \nthat provides protection from thermal damage. If the \ntemperature exceeds the over -temperature threshold \nthe module will shut down.  \n \nThe module wi ll try to restart after shutdown. If the \nover-temperature condition still exists during restart, the \nmodule will shut down again. This restart trial will \ncontinue until the temperature is within specification.  \n \nRemote On/Off  \n \nThe remote on/off feature on t he module can be either \nnegative or positive logic. Negative logic turns the \nmodule on during a logic low and off during a logic high. \nPositive logic turns the modules on during a logic high \nand off during a logic low.  \n \nRemote on/off can be controlled by an external switch \nbetween the on/off terminal and the V i(-) terminal.  The \nswitch can be an open collector or open drain.  \n \nFor negative logic i f the remote on/off feature is not \nused, please short the on/off pin to Vi( -). For pos itive \nlogic i f the remote o n/off feature is not used, please \nleave the on/off pin to floating . \nVo(+) Vi(+)\nVo(-)Sense(-)Sense(+)\nVi(-)ON/OFF \n \nFigure 17: Remote on/off implementation  \n \nRemote Sense  \n \nRemote sense compensates for voltage drops on the \noutput by sensing the actual output voltage at the point \nof load.

To ens ure proper, reliable operation, sufficient \ncooling of the power module is needed over the entire \ntemperature range of the module. Convection cooling is \nusually the dominant mode of heat transfer.  \n \nHence, the choice of equipment to characterize the \nthermal performance of the power module is a wind \ntunnel.  \n \nThermal Testing Setup  \n \nDelta’s DC/DC power modules are characterized in \nheated vertical wind tunnels that simulate the thermal \nenvironments encountered in most electronics \nequipment. This type of equipment  commonly uses \nvertically mounted circuit cards in cabinet racks in which \nthe power modules are mounted.  \n \nThe following figure shows the wind tunnel \ncharacterization setup. The power module is mounted \non a 185mmX185mm,70μm (2Oz),6 layers test PWB \nand is ve rtically positioned within the wind tunnel.
