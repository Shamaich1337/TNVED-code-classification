It is housed in the SO6 package. \nThis photocoupler guarantees operation at up to 125 \ue00c and on supplies from 2.7 V to 5.5 V. Since TLP2361 has\nguaranteed 1 mA low supply current (I CCL/ICCH), and 1.6 mA (T a = 125 \ue00c) low threshold input current(I FHL), it\ncontributes to energy saving of devices. It can drive directly from a microcomputer for a low input current.\nThe TLP2361 has an internal Faraday shield that provides a guaranteed common-mode transient immunity of\n±20 kV/ µs. \n3. 3. 3. 3.

Precautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General StoragePrecautions for General Storage\n•Avoid storage locations where devices may be exposed to moisture or direct sunlight.\n•Follow the precautions printed on the packing label of the device for transportation and storage.\n•Keep the storage location temperature and humidity within a range of 5 \ue00c to 35 \ue00c and 45 % to 75 %,\nrespectively.\n•Do not store the products in locations with poisonous gases (especially corrosive gases) or in dusty\nconditions.\n•Store the products in locations with minimal temperature fluctuations. Rapid temperature changes during\nstorage can cause condensation, resulting in lead oxidation or corrosion, which will deteriorate the\nsolderability of the leads.\n•When restoring devices after removal from their packing, use anti-static containers.\n•Do not allow loads to be applied directly to devices while they are in storage.\n•If devices have been stored for more than two years under normal storage conditions, it is recommended\nthat you check the leads for ease of soldering prior to use.2015-11-02\nRev.5.0©2015 Toshiba Corporation \nTLP2361\n1114. 14. 14. 14.

  - Isolation Voltage: 3750 Vrms (minimum)

- **Current Ratings:**
  - Input Forward Current (IF): 10 mA (maximum)
  - Supply Current (ICCL/ICCH): 1.0 mA (maximum)
  - Output Current (IO): 20 mA (maximum)

- **Power Consumption:**
  - Input Power Dissipation: 20 mW (maximum)
  - Output Power Dissipation: 20 mW (maximum)

- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - -40 °C to 125 °C

- **Package Type:**
  - SO6 (6-pin surface mount)

- **Special Features:**
  - High-speed data transfer rate: 15 MBd (typical)
  - Common-mode transient immunity: ±20 kV/µs (minimum)

  - UL, cUL, VDE, and CQC safety approvals

- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: 1 (according to JEDEC J-STD-020E)

### Typical Applications:
The TLP2361 is commonly used in:
- **Factory Networking:** For reliable communication between devices in industrial settings.
- **High-Speed Digital Interfacing:** Suitable for instrumentation and control devices that require fast data transfer.
- **I/O Interface Boards:** Acts as an interface between microcontrollers and peripheral devices, ensuring signal integrity and isolation.

This component is ideal for applications where electrical isolation is critical, such as in data communication systems, control systems, and safety-critical environments. Its low power consumption and high-speed capabilities make it a versatile choice for modern electronic designs.
