F | Page 4 of 41 GENERAL DESCRIPTION \nThe AD9852 digital synthesizer is a highly integrated device \nthat uses advanced DDS technology, coupled with an internal high speed, high performance D/A converter to form a digitally programmable, agile synthesizer function. When referenced to an accurate clock source, the AD9852 generates a highly stable frequency-, phase-, and amplitude-programmable cosine output \nthat can be used as an agile LO in communications, radar, and \nmany other applications. The innovative high speed DDS core of the AD9852 provides 48-bit frequency resolution (1 μHz tuning resolution with 300 MHz SYSCLK). Retaining 16 bits for phase-to-amplitude conversion ensures excellent spurious-free \ndynamic range (SFDR). \nThe circuit architecture of the AD9852 allows the generation of \noutput signals at frequencies up to 150 MHz, which can be digitally tuned at a rate of up to 100 million new frequencies \nper second. The (externally filtered) cosine wave output can be \nconverted to a square wave by the internal comparator for agile clock generator applications. The device provides two 14-bit phase registers and a single pin for BPSK operation.  \nFor higher-order PSK operation, the I/O interface can be used \nfor phase changes. The 12-bit cosine DAC, coupled with the innovative DDS architecture, provides excellent wideband and narrow-band output SFDR. When configured with the comparator, the 12-bit control DAC facilitates static duty cycle \ncontrol in the high speed clock generator applications.  \nThe 12-bit digital multiplier permits programmable amplitude \nmodulation, on/off output shaped keying, and precise amplitude \ncontrol of the cosine DAC output. Chirp functionality is also included for wide bandwidth frequency sweeping applications. \nThe AD9852 programmable 4× to 20× REFCLK multiplier cir-cuit internally generates the 300 MHz system clock from a lower frequency external reference clock. This saves the user the expense \nand difficulty of implementing a 300 MHz system clock source.  \nDirect 300 MHz clocking is also accommodated with either single-\nended or differential inputs. Single-pin, conventional FSK and the enhanced spectral qualities of ramped FSK are supported. The \nAD9852 uses advanced 0.35 μ CMOS technology to provide this \nhigh level of functionality on a single 3.3 V supply. \nThe AD9852 is pin-for-pin compatible with the AD9854 single-\ntone synthesizer. The AD9852 is specified to operate over the \nextended industrial temperature range of −40°C to +85°C. \nOVERVIEW \nThe AD9852 digital synthesizer is a highly flexible device that \naddresses a wide range of applications. The device consists of  an NCO with a 48-bit phase accumulator, a programmable reference clock multiplier, an inverse sinc filter, a digital multiplier, two 12-bit/300 MHz DACs, a high speed analog comparator, and an interface logic. This highly integrated \ndevice can be configured to serve as a synthesized LO agile \nclock generator and FSK/BPSK modulator. The theory of operation for the functional blocks of the device and a technical description of the signal flow through a DDS device is provided \nby Analog Devices, Inc., in the tutorial A Technical Tutorial on \nDigital Signal Synthesis . The tutorial also provides basic \napplications information for a variety of digital synthesis implementations. \n \nData Sheet  AD9852  \n \nRev.

This is du e to insufficient phase \naccumulation per a system clock period to produce enough LSB amplitude to the D/A converter. \n4 If a feature such as inverse sinc, which has 16 pipeline delays, can be bypassed, the total delay is reduced by that amount. \n5 The I/O UD CLK transfers data from the I/O port buffers to the  programming registers.

A2 is used only in parallel programming mode. IO RESET is used when \nthe serial programming mode is selected, allowing an IO RESET of the serial communication bus \nthat is unresponsive d ue to improper programming protocol.

A0 is used only in parallel programming \nmode. SDIO is used in 2 -wire seri al communication mode.  \n20  I/O UD CLK  Bidirectional I/O Update Clock. Direction is selected in control register. If selected as an input, a \nrising edge transfers the contents of the I/O port buffers to the programming registers. If I/O UD \nCLK is selected as an output (default), an output pulse (low to high) with a duration of eight \nsystem clock cycles indicates that an internal frequency update has occurred.  \n21  WR/SCLK  Write Parallel Data to I/O Port Buffers. Shared function with SC LK. Serial clock signal associated \nwith the serial programming bus. Data is registered on the rising edge. This pin is shared with \nWR when the parallel mode is selected. The mode is dependent on Pin 70 (S/P SELECT).  \n22  RD/ CS Read Parallel Data from Programming Registers. Shared function with CS. Chip select signal \nassociated with the serial programming bus. Active low. This pin is shared with RD when the \nparallel mo de is selected.  \n29 FSK/BPSK/HOLD  Multifunction Pin. Functions according to the mode of operation selected in the programming control register. If in the FSK mode, logic low selects F1 and  logic high selects F2. If in the BPSK \nmode, logic low selects Pha se 1 and  logic high selects Phase 2. In chirp mode, logic high \nengages the hold  function, causing the frequency accumulator to halt at its current location. To \nresume or commence chirp, logic low is asserted.  \n30 OSK  Output Shaped Keying. Must first be sel ected in the programming control register to function. \nA logic high causes the cosine DAC outputs to ramp up from zero -scale to full-scale amplitude \nat a preprogrammed rate. Logic low causes the full -scale output to ramp down to zero scale at \nthe preprogra mmed rate.  \n31, 32, 37, 38, 44, 50, 54, 60, 65  AVDD  Connections for the Analog Circuitry Supply Voltage.

A 0.01 µF chip cap acitor  from this pin to \nAVDD improves harmonic distortion and SFDR slightly. No connect is permissible , but resu lts in \na slight degradation in SFDR .  \n56  DAC R SET  Common Connection for Both DACs. Used to set the full -scale output current. R SET = 39.9/ I OUT. \nNormal  RSET range is from 8 k Ω (5 mA) to 2 k Ω (20 mA).  \n61  PLL FILTER  Connection for the External Zero -Compensation Network of the REFCLK Multiplier’s PLL Loop \nFilter. The zero -compensation  network consists of a 1.3 kΩ  resistor in series with a 0.01 µF \ncapacitor. The other side of the network should be connected to AVDD as close as possible to \nPin 60. For opt imum phase noise performance, the REFCLK multiplier can be bypassed by \nsetting the bypass PLL bit in Control Register 1E hex.  \n64  DIFF CLK ENABLE  Differential REFCLK Enable. A high level of this pin enables the differential clock inputs, REFCLK \nand REFCLK  (Pin 69 and Pin 68, respectively).   \n68  REFCLK  Complementary (180° Out  of Phase) Differential Clock Signal. User should tie this pin high or \nlow when single -ended clock mode is selected. Same signal levels as REFCLK .  \n69  REFCLK  Single -Ended (CMOS Logic Levels Required) Reference Clock Input or One of Two Differential \nClock Signals. In differential reference clock mode, both inputs can be CMOS logic levels or have \ngreater than 400 mV p -p square or sine waves center ed about 1.6 V dc.  \n70  S/P SELECT  Selects between serial programming mode (logic low) and parallel programming mode (logic  high).  \n71 MASTER RESET  Initializes the serial/parallel programming bus to prepare for user programming, and sets programming regi sters to a do -nothing state defined by the default values listed in Table 9. \nActive on logic high.

F | Page 18 of 41 MODES OF OPERATION \nThere are five programmabl e modes of operation of the AD9852. \nSelecting a mode requires that three bits in the control register \n(Parallel Address 1F hex) be programmed as shown in Table 6. \nTable 6. Mode Selection Table  \nMode 2  Mode  1  Mode 0  Result  \n0  0  0  Single  tone  \n0  0  1  FSK  \n0  1  0  Ramped FSK  \n0  1  1  Chirp  \n1  0  0  BPSK  \n \nIn each mode, engaging certain functions may be pr ohibit ed. \nTable 7 lists some important functions and their avail ability for \neach mode.  \nSINGLE  TONE (MODE 000)  \nWhen the MASTER RESET pin is asserted, single -tone mode \nbecomes the default. The user can  also access this mode by \nprogramming it into the control register. The phase accumulator, responsible for generating an output frequency, is presented with \na 48- bit value from the Frequency Tuning Word 1 registers with  \ndefault values of 0. Default values from the remaining applicable \nregisters further define the single -tone output signal qualities.  \nThe default values after  a master reset configures the device \nwith an output signal of 0 Hz and zero  phase. Upon power -up \nand reset, the output from both DACs is a dc value equal to the midscale output current. This is the default mode amplitude setting of 0. Refer to the On/Off Output Shaped Keying (OSK)  section  \nfor further explanation of the output amplitude control. It is necessary to program all or some of the 28 program registers to \nproduce a user -defined output signal. Figure 32 shows the \ntransition from  the default condition (0  Hz) to a user -defined \noutput frequency (F1).  As with all Analog Devices DDS  device s, the value of the frequency \ntuning word is determined using the following equation:  \nFTW  = (Desired Output Freq uency  × 2\nN)/SYSCLK  \nwhere:  \nN is the phase accumulator resolution (48 bits in this instance).  \nDesired Output Frequency  is expressed in hertz.  \nFTW  (frequency tuning word) is a decimal number.  \nAfter  a decimal number has been calculated, it must be rounded \nto an integer and then converted to binary format —a series of \n48 binary -weighted 1s and 0s. The fundamental sine wave DAC \noutput frequency range is from dc to one -half SYSCLK.  \nChanges in frequency are phase  continuous ; therefore,  the first \nsampled phase valu e of the new frequency is referenced from the \ntime of the last sampled phase value of the previous frequency.  \nThe 14 -bit phase register adjusts the cosine DAC’s output phase.  \nThe single -tone mode allows the user to control the following \nsignal qualities: \n• Output frequency to 48 -bit accuracy  \n• Output amplitude to 12 -bit accuracy  \n• Fixed, user -defined amplitude control  \n• Variable, programmable amplitude control  \n• Automatic, programmable, single -pin-controlled  \non/off output shaped keying  \n• Output phase to 14 -bit accu racy \nFurthermore, all of these qualities can be changed or modulated \nvia the 8 -bit parallel programming port at a 100 MHz parallel \nbyte rate  or at a 10 MHz serial rate. Incorporating this attribute \npermits FM, AM, PM, FSK, PSK, and ASK operation in the \nsingle-tone mode.  \n000 (SINGLE TONE) MODE\nF1 TW1000 (DEFAULT)\n0F1\n0FREQUENCY\nMASTER RESET\nI/O UD CLK\n00634-032 \nFigure 32.

Unramped (Traditional) FSK Mode \n \nUNRAMPED FSK (MODE 001) \nWhen this mode is selected, the output frequency of the DDS is \na function of the values loaded into Frequency Tuning Word Register 1 and Frequency Tuning Word Register 2 and the logic level of Pin 29 (FSK/BPSK/HOLD). A logic low on Pin 29 chooses F1 (Frequency Tuning Word 1, Parallel Address 4 hex \nto Parallel Address 9 hex), and a logic high chooses F2 \n(Frequency Tuning Word 2, Parallel Register Address A hex to Parallel Register Address F hex). Changes in frequency are phase continuous and are internally coincident with the FSK data pin (Pin 29); however, there is deterministic pipeline delay between the FSK data signal and the DAC output (see Table 1). \nThe unramped FSK mode (see Figure 33) is representative  \nof traditional FSK, radio teletype (RTTY), or teletype (TTY) transmission of digital data. FSK is a very reliable means of \ndigital communication; however, it makes inefficient use of  \nthe bandwidth in the RF spectrum. Ramped FSK, shown in Figure 34, is a method of conserving the bandwidth. RAMPED FSK (MODE 010) \nIn this method of FSK, changes from F1 to F2 are not instantaneous, but are accomplished in a frequency sweep or ramped fashion. The ramped notation implies the sweep is linear. Although linear sweeping, or frequency ramping, is easily and automatically accomplished, it is only one of many \npossibilities. Other frequency transition schemes can be \nimplemented by changing the ramp rate and ramp step size at any time during operation.  \nFrequency ramping, whether linear or nonlinear, necessitates \nthat many intermediate frequencies between F1 and F2 are output in addition to the primary F1 and F2 frequencies. Figure 34 and Figure 35 graphically depict the frequency vs. time characteristics of a linear ramped FSK signal. \nIn ramped FSK mode, the delta frequency word (DFW) is \nrequired to be programmed as a positive twos complement value. Another requirement is that the lowest frequency (F1) be programmed in the Frequency Tuning Word 1 registers.  \n \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

Ramped FSK Mode (Start at F2) \nThe purpose of ramped FSK is to provide better bandwidth \ncontainment than can be achieved using traditional FSK. In ramped FSK, the  instantaneous frequency changes of traditional  \nFSK are replaced with more gradual, user -defined frequency \nchanges. The dwell time at F1 and F2 can be equal to  or much \ngreater than the time spent at each intermediate frequency. The \nuser contro ls the dwell time at F1 and F2, the number of \nintermediate frequencies, and the time spent at each frequency. \nUnlike unramped FSK, ramped FSK requires the lowest frequency to be loaded into the F1 registers and the highest \nfrequency to be loaded into the F2 registers.  \nSeveral registers must be programmed to instruct the DDS regarding the resolution of intermediate frequency steps (48  bits) \nand the time spent at each step (20 bits). Furthermore,  the CLR \nACC1 bit in the control register should be toggled (low -high- low) \nprior to operation to ensure that the frequency accumulator is \nstarting from an all 0s output condition.  For piecewise, nonlinear frequency transitions, it is  necessary \nto reprogram the registers while the frequency transition is in \nprogress to  affect the d esired response.  \nParallel Register Address 1A hex to Parallel Register Address  1C \nhex comprise the 20 -bit ramp rate clock registers. This is a \ncountdown counter that outputs a single pulse whenever the count reaches 0. The counter is activated  any time a l ogic level \nchange occurs on the FSK input  (Pin 29). This counter is run at \nthe system clock rate, 300 MHz maximum. The time period between each output pulse is  \n(N + 1) × System Clock Period  \nwhere N is the 20 -bit ramp rate clock value programme d by  \nthe use r.  \nThe allowable range of N  is from 1 to (2\n20 − 1). The output of \nthis counter clocks the 48 -bit frequency accumulator shown in \nData Sheet  AD9852  \n \nRev. F | Page 21 of 41 Figure 36. The ramp rate clock determines the amount of time \nspent at each intermediate frequency between F1 and F2.  \nThe counter stops automaticall y when the destination \nfrequency is achieved. The dwell time spent at F1 and F2 is \ndetermined by the duration that the FSK input  (Pin 29 ) is held \nhigh or low after the destination frequency has been reached.  \nParallel Register Address 10 hex to Parallel Register Address 15 hex \ncomprise the 48 -bit, twos complement delta frequency word \nregisters. This 48 -bit word is accumulated (added to the \naccumulator’s output) every time it receives a clock pulse from \nthe ramp rate counter. The output of this accumulator is  added \nto or subtracted from the F1 or F2 frequency word, which is then fed into the input of the 48 -bit phase accumulator that \nforms the numerical phase steps for the sine and cosine wave \noutputs. In this fashion, the output frequency is ramped up and \ndow n in frequency according to the logic state of Pin  29. This \nramping rate is a function of the 20 -bit ramp rate clock. When  \nthe destination frequency is achieved, the ramp rate clock is stopped, halting  the frequency accumulation process.  \nGenerally speakin g, the delta frequency word is a much smaller \nvalue compared with  the value of the F1 or F2 tuning word. For \nexample, if F1 and F2 are 1 kHz apart at 13 MHz, the delta \nfrequency word might be only 25 Hz.  \nFigure 39 shows that premat ure toggling causes the ramp to \nimmediately reverse itself and proceed at the same rate and \nresolution until  the original frequency  is reached . \nThe control register contains a triangle bit at Parallel Register \nAddress 1F hex. Setting this bit high in Mode 010 causes an \nautomatic ramp -up and ramp -down between F1 and F2 to \noccur without toggling Pin 2 9 (shown in Figure 37). In fact, the \nlogic state of Pin 29 has no effect once the triangle bit is set high. This function uses the ram p rate  clock time period and \nthe step size of the delta frequency word to form a continuously sweeping linear ramp from F1 to F2 and back to F1 with equal dwell times at every frequency. Use this function to automatically \nsweep between any two frequencies from dc to Nyquist.  \nIn the ramped FSK mode with the triangle bit set high, an \nautomatic frequency sweep begins at either F1 or F2, according \nto the logic level on Pin 29 (FSK input pin) when the triangle \nbit’s rising edge occurs, as shown in Figure 38. If the FSK data \nbit is high instead of low, F2 , rather than F1 , is chosen as the \nstart frequency.

Automatic Linear Ramping Using the Triangle Bit  \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 22 of 41 Additional flexibility in the ramped FSK mode is provided by \nthe AD9852’s ability to respond to changes in the 48 -bit delta \nfrequency word and/or t he 20 -bit ramp rate  counter at any time \nduring the ramping from F1 to F2 or vice versa. To create these nonlinear frequency changes, it is necessary to combine several \nlinear ramps with different slopes in a piecewise fashion. This is \ndone by programming a nd executing a linear ramp at a rate or \nslope and then altering the slope (by changing the ramp rate clock or delta frequency word, or both). Changes in slope can be made as often as needed before the destination frequency has  \nbeen reached to form the desi red nonlinear frequency sweep \nresponse. These piecewise changes can be precisely timed using the 32 -bit internal update clock (see the Internal and External \nUpdate Clock  section).  \nNonlinear ramped FSK has the appearance of the c hirp function \nshown in Figure 41. The major difference between a ramped \nFSK function and a chirp function is that FSK is limited to \noperation between F1 and F2 , whereas c hirp operation has no \nF2 limit frequency.  \nTwo additional co ntrol bits (CLR ACC1 and CLR ACC2) are \navailable in the ramped FSK mode that allow more options. Setting CLR ACC1 (Register Address 1F hex) high clears the 48 -bit \nfrequency accumulator (ACC1) output with a retriggerable  \none-shot pulse of one system clock duration. If the CLR ACC1 \nbit is left high, a one -shot pulse is delivered on the rising edge of \nevery update clock. The effect is to interrupt the current ramp, \nreset the frequency to the start point (F1 or F2), and then continue to ramp up (or down) at th e previous rate. This occurs even when a static F1 or F2 destination frequency has been \nachieved.  \nAlternatively , the CLR ACC2 control bit (Register Address 1F hex) \ncan be used to clear both the frequency accumulator (ACC1) \nand the phase accumulator (ACC2).  When this bit is set high, \nthe output of the phase accumulator results in 0 Hz output from  \nthe DDS. As long as this bit is set high, the frequency and phase accumulators are cleared, resulting in 0 Hz output. To return to previous DDS operation, CLR ACC2 must be set to logic low.  \nCHIRP (MODE 011)  \nChirp mode is also known as pulsed FM. Most chirp systems use a linear FM sweep pattern, but the AD9852 can also support nonlinear patterns. In radar applications, use of chirp or pulsed \nFM allows operators to sig nificantly reduce the output power \nneeded to achieve the same result a single frequency radar system \nproduces.

Example of a Nonlinear Chirp \nBasic FM Chirp Programming Steps  \n1. Program a start frequency into Frequency Tuning Word 1 \n(Parallel Register Address 4 hex to Parallel Register \nAddress 9 hex), hereafter called FTW1. \n2. Program the frequency step resolution into the 48-bit, twos \ncomplement delta frequency word (Parallel Register Address 10 hex to Parallel Register Address 15 hex). \n3. Program the rate of change (time at each frequency) into the 20-bit ramp rate clock (Parallel Register Address 1A hex to Parallel Register Address 1C hex). \nWhen programming is complete, an I/O update pulse at Pin 20 engages the program commands. \nThe necessity for a twos complement delta frequency word is to \ndefine the direction in which the FM chirp moves. If the 48-bit delta frequency word is negative (MSB is high), the incremental frequency changes are in a negative direction from FTW1. If the 48-bit word is positive (MSB is low), the incremental frequency changes are in a positive direction from FTW1. It is important to note that FTW1 is only a starting point for FM chirp. There is no built-in restraint requiring a return to FTW1. Once the FM chirp begins, it is free to move (under program control) within the Nyquist bandwidth (dc to one-half the system clock). However, instant return to FTW1 can be easily achieved. \nTwo control bits (CLR ACC1 and CLR ACC2) are available in the \nFM chirp mode that allow the device to return to the beginning frequency, FTW1, or to 0 Hz. When the CLR ACC1 bit (Register Address 1F hex) is set high, the 48-bit frequency accumulator \n(ACC1) output is cleared with a retriggerable one-shot pulse of \none system clock duration. The 48-bit delta frequency word input to the accumulator is unaffected by the CLR ACC1 bit. If the CLR ACC1 bit is held high, a one-shot pulse is delivered to the frequency accumulator (ACC1) on every rising edge of the I/O \nupdate clock. The effect is to interrupt the current chirp, reset the \nfrequency to that programmed into FTW1, and continue the chirp at the previously programmed rate and direction. Figure 42 shows clearing of the frequency accumulator output in chirp mode. Shown in the diagram is the I/O update clock, which is either user \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 24 of 41 supplied or internally generated. See the Internal and External \nUpdate Clock  section for a discussion of the I/O update.  \nAlternatively , the CLR ACC2 control bit (Register Address 1F hex) \nis avail able to clear bo th the frequency  accumulator (ACC1) \nand the phase accumulator (ACC2). When this bit is set high, \nthe output of the phase accumulator results in 0 Hz output from  \nthe DDS. As long as this bit is set high, the frequency and phase accumulators are cleared, res ulting in 0 Hz o utput. To return to \nthe previous DDS operation, CLR ACC2 must be set to logic low. This bit is useful for  generating pulsed FM.  \nFigure 43 graphically illustrates the effect of the CLR ACC2 bit on \nthe DDS output frequency. Repro gramming the registers while \nthe CLR ACC2 bit is high allows a new FTW1 frequency and slope to be loaded.  Another function only available in  the chirp mode is the \nHOLD  pin (Pin 29 ). This function stops the clock signal to the \nramp rate cou nter, thereby ha lting any further clocking pulses \nto the frequency accumulator, ACC1.  \nThe effect is to halt the chirp at the frequency existing just before the HOLD pin is  pulled high. When the HOLD  pin is \nreturned low, the clock  resumes  and chirp continu es. During a \nhold condition, the user can  change the programming registers; \nhowever, the ramp rate counter must resume operation at its previous rate until a count of 0 is obtained before a new ramp rate count can be loaded.

Exam ple of Hold  Function  \n \nThe 32 -bit automatic I/O update counter can be used to \nconstruct complex chirp or ramped FSK sequences. Because \nthis internal counter is synchronized with the AD9852 system \nclock, it allows precisely timed program cha nges to be invok ed. \nFor such changes , the user need only reprogram the desired \nregisters before the automatic I/O update clock is generated.  \nIn chirp mode, the destination frequency is not directly speci -\nfied. If the user fails to control the chirp, the D DS automatically  \nconfines itself to the frequency range between dc and Nyquist. \nUnless terminated by the user, the chirp continues until power \nis removed.  When the chirp destination frequency is reached, the  user can \nchoose any of the following actions : \n• Stop at the destin ation frequency either by using the \nHOLD pin  or by loading all 0s into the delta frequency \nword registers of the frequency accumulator (ACC1).  \n• Use the HOLD pin function to stop the chirp, and then ramp down the output amplitude either by us ing the digital multi -\nplier stages and the output shaped  keying pin  (Pin 30)  or by \nusing the  program register control (Address 21 hex to \nAddress 24 hex).  \n• Abruptly end the transmission with the CLR ACC2  bit. \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 26 of 41 • Continue chirp by reversing the direction and re turning to \nthe p revious  or another destination frequency in a linear or \nuser-directed manner. If this involves reducing the  \nfrequency, a negative 48 -bit delta frequency word (the \nMSB is set to 1) must be loaded into Register 10 hex to \nRegister 15 hex. Any decreasing frequ ency step of the delta \nfrequency word requires the MSB to be set to logic high.  \n• Continue chirp by immediately returning to the beginning \nfrequency (F1) in a sawtooth fashion, and then repeat ing the \nprevious chirp process. In this case, a n automatic repeati ng \nchirp can be set up by using the 32 -bit update clock to issue  \nthe CLR ACC1 command at precise time intervals. Adjusting the timing intervals or changing the delta frequency word \nchanges the chirp range. It is incumbent upon the user to \nbalance the chirp  duration and frequency resolution to \nachieve the proper frequency range.  \n BPSK (MODE 100)  \nBinary, biphase, or bipolar phase shift keying  is a means to \nrapidly s elect between two preprogrammed  14-bit output phase \noffsets. The logic state of  BPSK (Pin 29)  controls the selection of \nPhase Adjust Register 1 or Phase Adjust Register 2. When low, BPSK selects Phase Adjust Register 1; when high, it selects Phase Adjust Register 2. Figure 45 illustrates phase changes \nmade to four cycles of  an output carrier.  \nBasic BPSK Programming Steps  \n1. Program a carrier frequency into Frequency Tuning Word  1. \n2. Program the appropriate 14 -bit phase words into Phase Adjust \nRegister 1 and Phase Adjust Register 2.  \n3. Attach the BPSK data source to Pin 29.  \n4. Activate the I/O update clock when ready.  \nIf higher -order  PSK modulation is desired, the user can select \nsingle -tone mode and program Phase Adjust Register 1 using \nthe serial or high speed parallel programming bus.  \nBPSK DATA360\n0PHASE\nMODE\nFTW1\nPHASE ADJUST 1000 (DEFAULT)\n0\nPHASE ADJUST 2100 (BPSK)\nF1\n270°\n90°\nI/O UD CLK\n00634-045 \nFigure 45.

F | Page 27 of 41 USING THE AD9852  \nINTERNAL AND EXTERNA L UPDATE CLOCK  \nThe update clock function is comp osed of a bidirectional \nI/O pin (Pin 20)  and a programmable 32 -bit down -counter. In \norder for programming changes to be transferred from the I/O \nbuffer registers to the a ctive core of the DDS, a clock signal \n(low -to-high edge) must be externally supplied to Pin 20 or \ninternally generated by the 32 -bit update clock.  \nWhen the user provides an external update clock, it is internally \nsynchronized with the sys tem clock to prev ent partial transfer \nof program register information due to violation of data setup \nor hold times. This mode provides  the user with complete control \nof when updated program information becomes effective. The default mode for the update clo ck is internal (i nternal/external \nupdate clock control register bit is logic high). To switch to external update clock mode, the internal/external update clock control register bit must be set to logic low. The internal update mode generates automatic, per iodic update puls es at intervals \nset by the user.  \nAn internally generated update clock can be established by programming the 32 -bit update clock registers (Address 16 hex \nto Address 19 hex) and setting the internal/external update clock control register b it (Address 1F he x) to logic high. The update \nclock countdown counter function operates at half the rate of \nthe system clock (150  MHz maximum) and counts down from a \n32-bit binary value (programmed by the user). When the count  \nreaches 0, an automatic I/O u pdate of the DDS output or the DDS \nfunctions is generated. The update clock is internally and externally routed to Pin 20 to allow users to synchronize the program ming of \nupdate information with the update clock rate. The time between update pulses is give n as \n(N + 1)(Syst em Clock Period × 2) \nwhere N is the 32 -bit value programmed by the user, and the \nallowable range of N  is from 1 to (2\n32 − 1).  \nThe internally generated update pulse output on Pin 20 has a fixed high time of eight system clock cycles.  \nProgramming the update  clock register for values less than 5 causes \nthe I/O UD CLK pin to remain high. Although t he update clock \ncan still function  in this state , it cannot be used to indicat e when \ndata is transferring. This is an effect of the minimum high pul se \ntime when I/O UD CLK functions as  an output.  ON/OFF OUTPUT SHAPED  KEYING (OSK)  \nThe on/off OSK  feature allows the user to control the amplitude \nvs. time slope of the cosine DAC output signal. This function is \nused in burst transmissions of digital data  to reduce the ad verse \nspectral impact of short, abrupt bursts of data. Users must first \nenable the digital multiplier by setting the OSK EN bit (Control \nRegister  Address 20 hex) to logic high in the control register. \nOtherwise, if the OSK EN bit is set lo w, the digital mu ltiplier \nresponsible for amplitude control is bypassed, and the cosine \nDAC output is set to full -scale amplitude.  \nIn addition to setting the OSK EN bit, a second control bit, OSK INT (also at Address 20 hex), must be set to logic high. Lo gic high \nselects the linear internal control of the output ramp -up or ramp -\ndown function. A logic low in the OSK INT bit switches control of the digital multiplier to a user -programmable 12- bit register, \nallowing users to dynamically shape the amplitude tr ansition in \npract ically any fashion. The 12 -bit register, labeled output shape  \nkey, is located at Address 21 hex to Address 22 hex, as indicated  \nin Table 9. The maximum output amplitude is a function of the \nR\nSET resistor and i s not programmabl e when OSK INT is enabled.  \nABRUPT ON/OFF KEYING\nSHAPED ON/OFF KEYINGZERO\nSCALE\nZERO\nSCALEFULL\nSCALE\nFULL\nSCALE\n00634-046 \nFigure 46. On/Off Output Shaped Keying  \nThe transition time from zero scale to full scale must also be programmed. The transition time is a function of two fixed elements and one variabl e. The variable element is the pro -\ngrammable 8 -bit ramp rate  counter. This is a countdown counter \nthat is clocked at the system clock rate (300 MHz maximum) \nand generates one pulse whenever the counter reaches 0. This \npulse is routed to a 12 -bit counter th at increments with each \npulse received. The outputs of the 12 -bit counter are connected  \nto the 12 -bit digital multiplier. When the digital multiplier has  \na value of all 0s at its inputs, the input signal is multiplied by 0, producing zero scale. When the  multiplier has a  value of all 1s, \nthe input signal is multiplied by a value of 4095  or 4096, producing \nnearly full scale. There are 4094 remaining fractional multiplier values that produce output amplitudes scaled according to their binary values.  \n \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 28 of 41 The tw o fixed elements of the transition time are the period of \nthe system clock (which drives the ramp rate  counter) and the \nnumber of amplitude steps (4096). For example, if  the system \nclock of the AD9852 is 100 MHz (10 ns period)  and the ramp \nrate counter is programmed for a minimum count of 3, two system \nclock periods are required: one rising edge loads the countdown  \nvalue, and the next edge decrements the counter from 3 to 2. If the \ncountdown  value is less than 3, the ramp rate counter stalls and \ntherefore  produces a constan t scaling value to the digital multiplier . \nThis stall condition may have an application for the user.  \nThe relationship of the 8 -bit countdown  value to the time between \noutput pulses is given as \n(N + 1) × System Clock Period  \nwhere N is the 8 -bit countdown  value.  A total of  4096 output  pulses is required to advance the 12 -bit \nup-counter from zero scale to full scale. Therefore, the minimum \noutput shaped keying ramp time for a 100 MHz system clock is  \n4096 × 4 × 10 ns ≈ 164 µs  \nThe maximum ramp time is  \n4096 × 256 × 10 ns ≈  10.5 ms  \nFinally , by changing the logic state of Pin 30, output shaped \nkeying automatically performs the programmed output envelope \nfunctions when OSK INT is high. A logic high on Pin 30 c auses \nthe outputs to linearly ramp up to full -scale amplitude and hold \nuntil the logic level is changed to low, causing the outputs to ramp down to zero scale.  \n \n \n12-BIT DIGITAL\nMULTIPLIER12 12(BYPASS MULTIPLIER)\nOSK EN = 0\nOSK EN = 1OSK EN = 0\nOSK EN = 1\n12\n12DIGITAL\nSIGNAL IN\nUSER-PROGRAMMABLE\n12-BIT MULTIPLIER\nOUTPUT SHAPED\nKEYING MULTIPLIER\nREGISTER12OSK INT = 1\nOSK INT = 0\n18-BIT RAMP\nRATE\nCOUNTERSYSTEM\nCLOCK\nON/OFF OUTPUT SHAPED\nKEYING PIN12-BIT\nUP/DOWN\nCOUNTERDDS DIGITAL\nOUTPUTCOSINE\nDAC\n00634-047 \nFigure 47.

F | Page 29 of 41 COSINE DAC  \nThe cosine output of the DDS drives the cosine DAC (300  MSPS \nmaximum). Its maximum output amplitude is set by the DAC R SET \nresistor at Pin 56. This is a current -output DAC with a full -scale \nmaximum output of 20 mA; however, a nominal 10 mA output \ncurrent provides best SFDR perfor mance. The value of R SET is \n39.93/I OUT, where I OUT is expressed in amps. DAC output  \ncompliance  specifications limit  the maximum voltage developed \nat the outputs to − 0.5 V to + 1  V.  Vo l t a g e s  developed beyond this  \nlimitation cause excessive DAC distortion and possibly \npermanent damage. The user must choose a proper load impedance to limit the output voltage swing to the compliance \nlimits. Both DAC outputs  should be terminated equ ally for best \nSFDR, especially at higher output frequencies, where harmonic distortion errors are more prominent.  \nThe cosine DAC is preceded by an inverse sin (x)/x filter \n(also called an inverse sinc filter) that precompensates for \nDAC  output amplitude var iations over frequency to achieve \nflat amplitude response from dc to Nyquist. This DAC can be \npowered down  when not needed  by setting the DAC PD bit \nhigh (Address 1D hex of the control register). Cosine DAC \noutputs are designated as IOUT1 (Pin  48) and \nIOUT1  (Pin  49).  \nCONTROL DAC  \nThe control DAC output can provide dc control levels to external circuitry, generate ac signals, or enable duty cycle control of the on -board comparator. The input to the control \nDAC is configured to accept twos c omplement data supplied by \nthe user. Data is channeled through the serial or parallel inter -\nface to the 12 -bit control DAC register (Address 26 hex and \nAddress  27 hex) at a maximum  data rate of 100 MHz. This DAC  is \nclocked at the system clock, 300 MSPS (ma ximum), and has the \nsame maximum output current capability as that of the cosine DAC. The single R\nSET resistor on the AD9852 sets the full -scale \noutput current for both DACs. When not needed, the control \nDAC can be powered down separately to conserve  power  by \nsetting the control DAC power -down bit high (Address 1D hex). \nControl DAC outputs are designated as IOUT2 (Pin  52) and \nIOUT2  (Pin  51).

Inverse Sinc Filter Response \nINVERSE SINC FUNCTIO N \nThis filte r precompensates input data to the cosine DAC for  \nthe sin(x)/x roll -off characteristic inherent in the DAC’s  \noutput spectrum. This allows wide bandwidth signals, such  \nas Q PSK,  to be output from the DAC without appreciable \namplitude variations as a funct ion of frequency. The inverse \nsinc function can be bypassed to significantly reduce power consumption, especially at higher clock speeds. \nInverse sinc is engaged by default and is bypassed by bringing \nthe bypass inverse sinc bit high in Control Register 20  hex, as \nnoted  in Table 9.  \nREFCLK MULTIPLIER  \nThe REFCLK multiplier  is a programmable PLL -based \nreference clock multiplier  that allows the user to select an \ninteger clock multiplying value over the range of 4 × to 20 ×. Use \nof thi s function allows users to input as little as 15 MHz at the \nREFCLK input to produce a 300 MHz internal system clock. Five bits in Control Register 1E hex set the multiplier value, as described in Table 8. \nThe R EFCLK multiplier fu nction can be bypassed to allow \ndirect clocking of the AD9852 from an external clock source. The system clock for the AD9852 is either the output of the REFCLK multiplier (if it is engaged) or the REFCLK inputs. REFCLK can be either a si ngle-ended or diffe rential input by \nsetting Pin 64 (DIFF CLK ENABLE)  low or high, respectively.  \nPLL Range Bit  \nThe PLL range bit selects the frequency range of the REFCLK \nmultiplier PLL. For op eration from 200 MHz to 300 MHz  \n(internal system clock rate) , the PLL range bit sho uld be set to \nLogic 1. For operation below 200 MHz, set the PLL range bit to \nLogic 0. The PLL range bit adjusts the PLL loop parameters for optimized phase noise performance within each range.  \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. F | Page 30 of 41 PLL Filter  \nThe PLL FILTER pin  (Pin 61 ) prov ides the connection  for the \nexternal zero -compensation  network of the PLL loop filter. The \nzero -compensation  network consists of a 1.3 kΩ resistor in \nseries with a 0.01 µF capacitor. The other side of the network \nshould be connected  as close as possible to Pin 60  (AVDD ). For  \noptimum phase noise performance, the clock multiplier can be \nbypassed by setting the byp ass PLL bit in Control Register \nAddress 1E hex. \nDifferential REFCLK Enable  \nA high level on the DIFF CLK ENABLE pin enables the differential \nclock inputs, REFCLK (Pin 6 9) and REFCLK  (Pin 68). The min-\nimum differential signal amplitude requ ired is 400 mV p -p at \nthe REFCLK input pins. The center point or common -mode \nrange of the differential signal can range from 1.6 V to 1.9 V . \nWhen Pin 64 (DIFF CLK ENAB LE) is tied low, REFCLK (Pin 69) \nis the only active clock input. This is referred to as s ingle -ended \nmode. In this mode, Pin 68 ( REFCLK ) should be tied low  or high.  \nHIGH SPEED COMPARATO R \nThe comparator is optimized for high speed and has a toggle \nrate greater than 300  MHz , low jitter, sensitive input, and built -\nin hysteresis.  It also has an output level of 1 V p -p minimum into 50 Ω or CMOS logic levels into high impedance loads. The com -\nparator can be powered down separately to conserve power. This comparator is used in clock -generator applications to square up \nthe filtered sine wave generated by the DDS.  \nPOWER -DOWN  \nThe programming  registers allow several individual stages to  be \npowered down to reduce power consumption while maintaining the functionality of the desired stages. These stages are identified in  \nthe Register Layout table ( Table 9) in the Add ress 1D hex section.  \nPower -down is achieved by setting the specified bits to logic high. \nA logic low indicates that the stages are powered up.  \nFurthermore, and perhaps most importantly , the inverse sinc \nfilters and the digital multiplier st ages can be bypassed to achieve \nsignificant power reduction by  programming the control regis -\nters in Address 20 hex. Again, logic high causes the stage to be \nbypassed. Of particular importance is the inverse sinc filter \nbecause this stage consumes a signif icant amount of power.  \nA full power -down occurs when all four PD bits in Control \nRegister 1D hex are set to logic high. This reduces power \nconsumption to approximately 10 mW (3 mA).  \n \nData Sheet  AD9852  \n \nRev. F | Page 31 of 41 PROGRAMMING THE AD9852  \nThe AD9852 Register Layout table ( Table 9) contains information \nfor programming a chip for a desired functionality. Although  \nmany applications require very little programming to configure \nthe AD9852, some use  all 12 accessible register banks. The \nAD9852 supports an 8- bit para llel I/O operati on or an SPI -\ncompatible serial I/O operation. All accessible registers can be \nwritten and read back in either I/O operating mode.  \nS/P SELECT  (Pin 70 ) is used to configure the I/O mode. \nSystems that use a parallel I/O mode must connect the S/P SELECT pin t o V\nDD. Systems that operate in the serial I/O mode \nmust tie the S/P SELECT pin to GND.  \nRegardless of the mode, the I/O port data is written to a buffer \nmemory that only affect s operation of the part after the contents \nof the buffer memory a re transferred t o the register banks. This \ntransfer of information occurs synchronous  to the  system clock \nin one of two ways:  \n• The transfer is internally controlled at a rate programmed by the user.  \n• The transfer is externally controlled by the user. I/O opera -\ntions can occ ur in the absence of REFCLK, but data cannot  be \nmoved from the buffer memory to the register bank without  \nREFCLK. (See the Internal and External Update Clock  \nsection for details.)  \nMASTER RESET  \nThe MASTER RESET pin must be held  at logic high active for  \na minimum of 10 system clock cycles. This initializes  the com -\nmunication bus and loads the default values listed in Table 9. \nPARALLEL I/O OPERATI ON \nWith the S/P SELECT pin tied high, the parallel I/O mode is \nactive. The I/O port is compatible with industry -standard DSPs \nand microcontrollers. Six address bits, eight bidirectional data \nbits, and separate write/read control inputs comprise  the I/O \nport pins.  \nParallel I/O operation allows write access to each byte of any \nregister in a single I/O operation of up to one per 10.5 ns. \nReadback capability for each register is included to ease designing with the AD9852.  \nReads are not guaranteed at 100 MHz, because they are \nintended for software d ebugging only.  \nParallel I/O operation timing diagrams are shown in Figure 49 \nand Figure 50.

The AD9852 serial port is a flexible, sync hronous, serial \ncommunication port , allowing easy interface to many industry -\nstandard microcontrollers and microprocessors. The serial I/O is compatible with most synchronous transfer formats, including both the Motorola 6905/11 SPI and Intel 8051 SSR  protocols. \nThe inter face allows read/write access to all 12 registers that \nconfigure the AD9852 and can be configured as a single -pin  \nI/O (SDIO) or two unidirectional pins for in put and output \n(SDIO/SDO). Data transfers are supported in MSB - or LSB - \nfirst format at up to 10 MHz.  \nWhen configured for serial I/O operation, most pins from the AD9852 parallel port are inactive; only some pins are used for serial I/O operation. Table 10 describes pin requirements for \nserial I/O operation.  \nWhen operating  the device  in the serial I/O mode, it is best to \nuse the external I/O update clock  mode to avoid an I/O update \nclock  occurring during a serial communication cycle. Such an \noccurrence may  cause incorrect programming due to a partial \ndata tra nsfer. Therefore , user s should write  to the device between \nI/O update clocks . To exit the default internal update mode, \nprogram the device for external update operation at power -up \nbefore starting the REFCLK signal  but after a master reset. \nStarting the RE FCLK causes this  information to transfer to the \nregister bank, forcing  the device to switch to  external update mode.  \nAD9852  Data Sheet  \n \nRev.

F | Page 34 of 41 GENERAL OPERATION OF  THE SERIAL INTERFACE  \nThere are two phases of  a serial communication cycle with the \nAD9852. Phase 1 is the instruc tion cycle, whic h is the writing of \nan instruction byte into the AD9852  coincident with the first \neight SCLK rising edges. The instruction byte provides the \nAD9852 serial port controller with information regarding the data transfer cycle, which is Phase 2 of the communica tion \ncycle. The Phase 1 instruction byte defines whether the next  \ndata transfer is a read or write  and the register address to be \nacted upon.  \nThe first eight SCLK rising edges of each communication cycle \nare used to write the instruction by te into the AD98 52. The \nremaining SCLK edges are for Phase 2 of the communication \ncycle. Phase 2 is the actual data transfer between the AD9852 and the system controller. The number of data bytes transferred during Phase 2 of the communication cycle is a f unction of the \nregister address. The AD9852 internal serial I/O controller \nexpects every byte of the register being accessed to be \ntransferred. Table 11 describes how many bytes must be \ntransferred.  \nTable 11. Register Address vs. Data Bytes Transferred \nSerial \nRegister Address Register Name  Number \nof Bytes \nTransferred  \n0  Phase Offset Tuning Word Register 1  2  \n1  Phase Offset Tuning Word Register 2  2  \n2  Frequency Tuning Word 1  6  \n3  Frequency Tuning Wo rd 2  6  \n4  Delta frequency register  6  \n5  Update clock rate register  4  \n6  Ramp rate clock register  3  \n7  Control register  4  \n8  Digital multiplier register  2  \nA  On/off output shaped keying ramp \nrate register  1  \nB  Control DAC register  2  \n \nAt the completi on of a communication cycle, the AD9852 serial \nport controller expects the subsequent  eight rising SCLK edges \nto be the instruction byte of the next communication cycle. In \naddition, an active high input on the IO RESET  pin immediately \nterm inates the curre nt communication cycle. After IO RESET  \nreturns low, the AD9852 serial port controller requires the sub -\nsequent  eight rising SCLK edges to be the instruction byte of \nthe next communication cycle.  All data input to the AD9852 is registered o n the rising edg e of \nSCLK , and a ll data is driven out of the AD9852 on the falling \nedge of SCLK.  \nFigure 51 and Figure 52 are useful in understanding the general \noperation of the AD9852 serial port.  \nINSTRUCTION\nCYCLEDATA TRANSFERINSTRUCTION\nBYTE DATA BYTE 1 DATA BYTE 2 DATA BYTE 3\nSDIOCS\n00634-051 \nFigure 51.

Logic high indicates that a read oper ation will occur . Logic 0 \nindicates that a write operation will occur.  \nBit 6, Bit 5, and Bit 4 of the instruction byte are dummy bits \n(don’t care).  \nA3, A2, A1, A0 —Bit 3, Bit 2, Bit 1, and Bit 0 of the instruction \nbyte determine which register is accessed d uring the data t ransfer \nportion of the communication cycle (see Table 9 for register \naddress details).  \n \n \n \nData Sheet  AD9852  \n \nRev. F | Page 35 of 41 SERIAL INTERFACE POR T PIN DESCRIPTIONS  \nTable 12.  \nPin  Description  \nSCLK  Serial Clock (Pin 21). Th e serial clock p in is used to synchronize data to and from the AD9852 and to run the internal state \nmachines. The SCLK maximum frequency is 10 MHz.  \nCS Chip Select (Pin 22). Active low input that allows more than one device on the sa me serial commun ication line. The SDO and \nSDIO pins go to a high impedance state when this input is high. If this pin is driven high during a communication cycle, th e \ncycle is suspended until CS is reactivated low. The c hip select  pin can be tied lo w in systems that maintain control of SCLK.  \nSDIO  Serial Data I/O (Pin 19). Data is always written to the AD9852 on this pin. However, this pin can be used as a bidirectional data \nline. The configuration of this pin is controlled by Bit 0 o f Register Address 20 hex. The default is Logic 0, which configures the \nSDIO pin as bidirectional.  \nSDO  Serial Data Out (Pin 18). Data is read from this pin for protocols that use separate lines for transmitting and receiving dat a. \nIn the case where the A D9852 operates i n a single bidirectional I/O mode, this pin does not output data and is set to a high \nimpedance state.  \nIO RESET  Synchronize I/O Port (Pin 17). Synchronizes the I/O port state machines without affecting the contents of the addressable \nregis ters. An active high input on the IO RESET  pin causes the current communication cycle to terminate. After the IO RESET  pin \nreturns low (Logic 0), another communication cycle can  begin, starting with the instruction byte.  \n \nNotes on Serial Port Operation  \nThe AD9852 serial  port configuration bits reside in Bit 1 and \nBit 0 of Register Address 20 hex. The configuration changes \nimmediately  upon a valid I/O update. For  multibyte transfers, \nwriting to this register can occur during the middle of a \ncommunication c ycle. Care must be taken to compensate for \nthis new configuration during  the remainder of the  current \ncommunication cycle.  \nThe system must maintain synchronization with the AD9852 ; \notherwise,  the internal control logic is not able to recognize further \ninstructions. For example, if the system sends the instruction to \nwrite a 2 -byte register and then pulses the SCLK pin for a 3 -byte \nregister (24 additional SCLK rising edges), communication  \nsynchronization is lost. In this case, the first 16 SCLK rising \nedges after the instru ction cycle properly write the first two data \nbytes into the AD9852, but the subsequent  eight rising SCLK \nedges are interpreted as the next instruction byte, not the final byte of the previous communication cycle.  \nIn cases where synchroniza tion is lost bet ween the system and \nthe AD9852, the IO RESET  pin provides a means to re -establish \nsynchronization without reinitializing the entire chip. Asserting the IO RESET  pin (active high) resets the AD9852 serial port \nstate machine, terminating the current I/O oper ation and forcing  \nthe device into a state in which the next eight SCLK rising edges \nare understood to be an instruction byte. The IO RESET  pin \nmust be deasserted (low) before the next instruction byte write \ncan begin. Any information writte n to the AD9852 registers \nduring a valid communication cycle pr ior to loss of synchro -\nnization  remains intact.   \nMSB/LSB TRANSFERS  \nThe AD9852 serial port can support both  MSB-  and LSB- first \ndata formats. This functionality is controlled by Bit 1 of Serial \nBank 20 hex. Whe n this bit is set active high, the AD9852 serial \nport is in LSB -first format. This bit defaults low, to the MSB -first \nformat. The instruction byte must be written in the format indicated by Bit 1 of Serial Register Bank 20 hex . Therefore , if \nthe AD9852 is in LSB -first mode, the instruction byte must be \nwritten from LSB to MSB.  \nCS\nSCLK\nSDIOtPRE\ntDSU tSCLKPWH tSCLKPWLtSCLK\ntDHLD\nSECOND BIT FIRST BIT\nSYMBOL\ntPREtSCLKtDSUtSCLKPWHtSCLKPWLtDHLDMIN\n30ns\n100ns\n30ns\n40ns\n40ns\n0nsDEFINITION\nCS SETUP TIME\nPERIOD OF SERIAL DATA CLOCK\nSERIAL DATA SETUP TIME\nSERIAL DATA CLOCK PULSE WIDTH HIGH\nSERIAL DATA CLOCK PULSE WIDTH LOW\nSERIAL DATA HOLD TIME\n00634-053 \nFigure 53.

It is composed of 32 bits. \nBit 31 is located at the top left position, and Bit 0 is located in the low er right positio n of the shaded area of Table 9. The register has been \nsubdivided into bits  to make it easier to locate the information  associated with specific control categories.  \nTable 13. Control Registe r Bit Descriptio ns \nBit Description  \nCR [31:29]  Open.  \nCR [28]  The comparator power- down bit. When this bit is set to Logic 1, it indicates to the comparator that a power- down mode is \nactive. This bit is an output of the digital section and is an input to t he analog section.  \nCR [27]  Must always be written to Logic 0. Writing this bit to Logic 1 causes the AD9852 to stop function ing until a master reset is applied.  \nCR [26]  The control DAC power -down bit. When this bit is set to Logic 1, it indicates to the control DAC that  power -down mode is active.  \nCR [25]  The full DAC power -down bit. When this bit is set to Logic 1, it indicates to both the cosine and control DACs , as well as the \nreference , that a power -down mode is active.  \nCR [24]  The digital power- dow n bit. When this  bit is set to Logic 1, it indicates to the digital section that a power- down mode is \nactive. Within the digital section, the clocks are forced to dc, effectively powering down the digital section. The PLL still  \naccepts the REFCLK signal an d continues to output the higher frequency.  \nCR [23]  Reserved. Write to 0.  \nCR [22]  The PLL range bit. The PLL range bit controls the VCO gain. The power-up state of the PLL range bit is Logic 1; a higher gain is \nrequired for frequencies greater than  200 M Hz. \nCR [21]  The bypass PLL bit, active high. When this bit is active, the PLL is powered down and the REFCLK input is used to drive the \nsystem clock signal. The power-up state o f the bypass PLL bit is Logic 1 with  PLL bypassed . \nCR [20:16]  The PLL multi plier factor. Th ese bits are the REFCLK multiplication factor unless the bypass PLL bit is set. The PLL multiplier \nvalid range is from 4 to 20, inclusive.  \nCR [15]  The Clear Accumulator 1 bit. This bit has a one -shot type of function. When this bit is written active (Lo gic 1), a Clear \nAccumulator 1 signal is sent to the DDS logic, resetting the accumulator value to 0. The bit is then automatically reset, but  \nthe buffer memory is not reset. This bit allows the user to easily create a sawtooth frequency swe ep pattern with minimal \nuser intervention. This bit is intended for chirp mode only, but its function is still retained in other modes.  \nCR [14]  The clear accumulator bit. When this bit is active high, it holds both the Accumulator 1 and Accumulator 2 val ues at 0 for as \nlong as the bit is active. This allows the DDS phase to be initialized via the I/O port.  \nCR [13]  The triangle bit. When this bit is set, the AD9852 automatically performs a continuous frequency sweep from F1 to F2 frequencies and back. The  effect is a triangular frequency sweep. When this bit is set, the operating mode must be set to \nramped FSK.  \nCR [12]  Don’t care.  \nCR [11:9]  The three bits that describe the five operating modes of the AD9852:  \n 0x0 = single -tone mode  \n 0x1 = FSK mode  \n 0x2 = ramped FSK mode  \n 0x3 = chirp mode  \n 0x4 = BPSK mode  \nCR [8]  The internal update active bit. When this bit is set to Logic 1, the I/O UD CLK pin is an output and the AD9852 generates the I/O UD CLK signal. When this bit is set to Logic 0, external I/O update function is performed, and the I/O UD CLK pin is \nconfigured as an input.  \nCR [7]  Reserved. Write to 0.  \nCR [6]  This is the inverse sinc filter bypass bit. When this bit is set, the data from the DDS block goes directly to the output shaped  \nkeying l ogic, and the cl ock for the inverse sinc filt er is stopped. Default is clear with the filter enabled . \nCR [5]  The output shaped  keying enable bit. When this bit is set, the output ramping function is enabled and is performed in \naccordance with the CR [4] b it requirements.  \nCR [4]  The internal/external output shaped  keying control bit. When this bit is set to Logic 1, the output shaped  keying factor is \ninternally generated and applied to the cosine DAC path. When this bit is cleared (default), the output sha ped keying funct ion is \nexternally controlled by the user, and the output shaped  keying factor is the value of the output shaped key ing multiplier \nregister. The two output shaped key ing multiplier registers also default low  so that the output is off at powe r-up until the d evice \nis programmed by the  user.  \nCR [3:2]  Reserved. Write to 0.  \nCR [1]  The serial port MSB -/LSB -first bit. Defaults low, MSB first.  \nCR [0]  The serial port SDO active bit. Defaults low, inactive.  \nData Sheet  AD9852  \n \nRev.

F | Page 38 of 41 POWER DISSIPATION AND THERMAL CONSIDERAT IONS  \nThe AD9852 is a multifunctional, high speed device that targets \na wide variety of synthesizer and agile clock applications. The numerous innovative features contained in th e device each \nconsume incremental power. If enabled in combination, the safe \nthermal operating conditions of the device may be exceeded.  \nCareful analysis and consideration of power dissipation and thermal management is a critical element in the successful application of t he AD9852 device.  \nThe AD9852 device is specified to operate within the industrial \ntemperature range of – 40°C to +85 °C. This specification is con -\nditional, however, such that the absolute maximum junction \ntemperature of 150 °C is not exceeded . At high operat ing tem -\nperatures, extreme care must be taken when operating the device to avoid exceeding the junction temperature and potentially  \ndamaging the device . \nMany variables contribute to the operating junction temperature within the device, incl uding  \n• Package st yle \n• Selected mode of operation  \n• Internal system clock speed  \n• Supply voltage  \n• Ambient temperature  \nThe combination of these variables determines the junction \ntemperature within the AD9852 device for a given set of \noperating conditions.  \nThe AD9852 device is avai lable in two package styles: a \nthermally enhanced surface -mount package with an exposed \nheat sink and a standard ( nonthermally enhanced ) surface -\nmount package. The thermal impedance of these packages is 16°C/W and 38 °C/W , respectively, meas ured under still air \nconditions.  \nTHERMAL IMPEDANCE  \nThe thermal impedance of a package can be thought of as a thermal resistor that exists between the semiconductor surface and the ambient air. The thermal impedance is determined by the package material and  the physical di mensions  of the package . \nThe dissipation of the heat from the package is directly depen -\ndent on the ambient air conditions and the physical connection \nmade between the IC package and the PCB.  \nAdequate dissipation of  power from the AD9852 r elies on all \npower and ground pins of the device being soldered directly to a \ncopper plane on a PCB. In addition, the thermally enhanced \npackage of the AD9852ASVZ has an exposed paddle on the \nbottom that must be soldered to a large copper plane , which,  \nfor convenience, c an be the ground plane. Sockets for either \npackage style of the AD9852 device are not recommended.  JUNCTION TEMPERATURE  CONSIDERATIONS  \nThe power dissipation (P DISS) of the AD9852 device in a given \napplication is determined by many operatin g conditions. So me \nof the conditions have a direct relationship with P DISS, such as \nsupply voltage and clock speed, but others are less deterministic.  \nThe total power dissipation within the device and its effect on \nthe junction temperature must be consider ed when using the \ndevice. The junction temperature of the device is given by  \nJunction Temperature = (Thermal Impedance  ×  \nPower Consumption ) + Ambient Temperature \nThe maximum ambient temperature combined with the \nmaximum junction temperature establish the following power \nconsumption limits for each package: 4.06 W for ASVZ models \nand 1.71 W for ASTZ models.  \nSupply Voltage  \nBecause PDISS = V × I, the supply voltage affects power dissipation \nand junction temperature. Users should design for 3.3  V \nnominally;  however, the devic e is guaranteed to meet specifications  \nover the full temperature range and over the supply voltage \nrange of 3.135 V to 3.465 V .  \nClock Speed  \nClock speed directly and linearly influences the total power \ndissipation of the device and therefore  the junction te mperature. \nAs a rule, the user should select the lowest internal clock speed \npossible to support a given application to minimize power dissipation. Typically , the usable frequency output bandwidth \nfrom a DDS is limited to 40% of the clock r ate to ensure th at the  \nrequirements on the output low -pass filter  are reasonable . For a \ntypical DDS application, the system clock frequency should be \n2.5 times the highest desired output frequency.  \nMode of Operation  \nThe selected mode of operation for the AD9852 significan tly \ninfluence s the total power consumption. The AD9852 offers \nmany features and modes, each of which imposes an additional \npower requirement. The  available  features make  the AD9852 \nsuitable for  a vari ety of applications, but the device is  designed \nto opera te with  only a few features enabled in a given application. \nEnabling multiple features at high  clock speeds may result in \nexceeding  the maximum junction temperature of the die and \ntherefore  severely l imit the long -term reliability of the device. \nFigure 59 and Figure 60 show the power require ments associated \nwith each feature  of the AD9852. These charts should be used \nas a guide when  determining how to optimize the AD9852 for \nreliable operation in a speci fic application.  \nFigure 59 shows the supply current consumed by the AD9852 \nover a range of frequencies for two possible configurations. All circuits enabled  means that the output scaling multiplier s, the \nData Sheet  AD9852  \n \nRev. F | Page 39 of 41 inverse sinc filter, bo th DACs, and the on -board comparator  \nare enabled. Basic configuration  means the output scaling \nmultipliers, the inverse sinc filter, the control DAC, and the  \non-board comparator are disabled.  \nFigure 60 shows the approximate cu rrent consumed by each of \nthe four functions.  \nFREQUENC Y (MHz)1400\n20SUPP LY CURRENT (mA)1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n60 100 140 180 220 260 300ALL CIRCUITS ENABLED\nBASIC CONFIGUR ATION\n00634-059\nNOTES\nTHIS GRAPH ASSUMES TH AT THE AD9852 DEVICE IS SOLDERED\nTO A MULTILAYER PCB PER THE RECOMMENDED BEST\nMANU FACTURING PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES FOR THE\nGIVEN PACKAGE TYPE. \nFigure 59.

F | Page 40 of 41 EVALUATION OF OPERAT ING CONDITIONS \nThe first step in applying the AD9852 is to select the internal \nclock frequency. Clock frequency selections greater than  200 MHz \nrequire use of the thermally enhanced package (AD9852AS VZ); \nclock freque ncy selections equal to or less than  200 MHz may  \nallow u se of the standard (nonthermally enhanced) plastic \nsurface -mount package, but more information is needed to \nmake this determination.  \nThe second step is to determine the maximum required  \noper ating tem perature for the AD9852 in a  given application. \nSubtract  this value from 150° C, which is the maximum junction \ntemperature allowed for the AD9852. For the extended indust -\nrial temperature range, the maximum operating temperature is \n85°C, which results in a difference of 65 °C. This is the maxi-\nmum temperature gra dient the device can experience due to \npower dissipation.  \nThe third step is to divide this maximum temperature gradient   \nby the thermal impedance to determine the maximum power  \ndissipation allowed for  the application. For this example, 65 °C \ndivided  by the thermal imped ance  of the package  yields a total power dissipation limit of 4.1 W and 1.7 W  for the thermally and \nnonthermally enhanced packages , respectively. Therefore,  for a \n3.3 V nominal power supp ly voltage, the current consumed by the \ndevice under ful l operating conditions must not exceed 515 mA \nfor the standard plastic package or  1242 mA for the thermally \nenhanced package. The total set of enabled functions and \noperating  conditions for a given  application must support these \ncurrent consumption limits.  \nFigure 59 and Figure 60 can be used to determine the suitability \nof a given AD9852 application in terms of the  power dissipation \nrequirements. These graphs assume that the AD9852 device is \nsoldered to a multilayer PCB according to the recommended best \nmanufacturing practices and procedures for a given package type.  \nThis ensures that the specified thermal impedance specifications are achieved.  \nTHERM ALLY ENHANCED PACKAG E \nMOUNTING GUIDELINES  \nRefer to the AN -772 Application Note  for details on mounting \ndevices with an exposed paddle.  \n \nData Sheet AD9852\n \nRev.
