This new front-end design \ncombines the accuracy and low noise performance of bipolar transistors with the speed of JFETs. This yields an amplifier with high slew rates, low offset and good noise performance at low supply currents. Bias currents are also low compared to \nbipolar designs. \nThe OP285 offers the slew rate and low power of a JFET \namplifier combined with the precision, low noise and low drift \nof a bipolar amplifier. Input offset voltage is laser-trimmed and \nguaranteed less than 250 μV . This makes the OP285 useful in dc-coupled or summing applications without the need for special selections or the added noise of additional offset adjustment circuitry. Slew rates of 22 V/μs and a bandwidth of \n9 MHz make the OP285 one of the most accurate medium \nspeed amplifiers available. The combination of low noise, speed and accuracy can be used \nto build high speed instrumentation systems. Circuits such as \ninstrumentation amplifiers, ramp generators, bi-quad filters and dc-coupled audio systems are all practical with the OP285. For applications that require long term stability, the OP285 has a \nguaranteed maximum long term drift specification. \nThe OP285 is specified over the XIND—extended industrial—\n(−40°C to +85°C) temperature range. The OP285 is available in \nan 8-lead SOIC_N surface mount package. \n    \nREV.

COP285\n–7–APPLICATIONS\nShort-Circuit Protection\nThe OP285 has been designed with inherent short-circuit\nprotection to ground. An internal 30 Ω resistor, in series with\nthe output, limits the output current at room temperature to\nISC+ = 40 mA and I SC- = –90 mA, typically, with ±15 V supplies.\nHowever, shorts to either supply may destroy the device when\nexcessive voltages or current are applied. If it is possible for a\nuser to short an output to a supply, for safe operation, the out-put current of the OP285 should be design-limited to ±30 mA,\nas shown in Figure 1.\nRFB\nFEEDBACK\nRX\n332/H9024    \nA1\nVOUT\nA1 = 1/2 OP285–\n+\nFigure 1. Recommended Output Short-Circuit Protection\nInput Over Current Protection\nThe maximum input differential voltage that can be appliedto the OP285 is determined by a pair of internal Zener diodes\nconnected across the inputs. They limit the maximum differ-\nential input voltage to ±7.5 V. This is to prevent emitter-base\njunction breakdown from occurring in the input stage of the\nOP285 when very large differential voltages are applied. How-\never, in order to preserve the OP285’s low input noisevoltage, internal resistance in series with the inputs were not\nused to limit the current in the clamp diodes. In small-signal\napplications, this is not an issue; however, in industrial appli-cations, where large differential voltages can be inadvertently\napplied to the device, large transient currents can be made to\nflow through these diodes. The diodes have been designed tocarry a current of ±8 mA; and, in applications where the\nOP285’s differential voltage were to exceed ±7.5 V, the resis-\ntor values shown in Figure 2 safely limit the diode current to±8 mA.\nA1\n909/H9024\nA1 = 1/2 909/H9024\n–\n+\nFigure 2. OP285 Input Over Current Protection\nOutput Voltage Phase Reversal\nSince the OP285’s input stage combines bipolar transistors\nfor low noise and p-channel JFETs for high speed perfor mance,\nthe output voltage of the OP285 may exhibit phase reversal if\neither of its inputs exceed its negative common-mode inputvoltage. This might occur in very severe industrial applications\nwhere a sensor or system fault might apply very large voltages onthe inputs of the OP285. Even though the input voltage range of\nthe OP285 is ±10.5 V, an input voltage of approximately –13.5 V\nwill cause output voltage phase reversal. In inverting amplifier\nconfigurations, the OP285’s internal 7.5 V input clamping\ndiodes will prevent phase reversal; however, they will not prevent\nthis effect from occurring in noninverting applications. For theseapplications, the fix is a simple one and is illustrated in Figure 3.A 3.92 k Ω resistor in series with the noninverting input of the\nOP285 cures the problem.\nRFB*\nVIN\nRS\n3.92k/H9024VOUT\nRL\n2k/H9024\n*RFB IS OPTIONAL+–\nFigure 3.

This recovery time is \nimportant  in applications  where  the amplifier  must  recover  quickly  \nafter a large abnormal  transient  event.  The circuit  shown  in Figure  4 \nwas used to evaluate the OP285’s overload recovery time.

Overload Recovery Time Test Circuit\nDriving the Analog Input of an A/D Converter\nSettling characteristics of operational amplifiers also include the\namplifier’s ability to recover, i.e., settle, from a transient output\ncurrent load condition. When driving the input of an A/Dconverter, especially successive-approximation converters, the\namplifier must maintain a constant output voltage under\ndynamically changing load current conditions. In these types ofconverters, the comparison point is usually diode clamped, but\nit may deviate several hundred millivolts resulting in high\nfrequency modulation of the A/D input current. Amplifiers thatexhibit high closed-loop output impedances and/or low unity-gain\ncrossover frequencies recover very slowly from output load\ncurrent transients. This slow recovery leads to linearity errors ormissing codes because of errors in the instantaneous input voltage.\nTherefore, the amplifier chosen for this type of application should\nexhibit low output impedance and high unity-gain bandwidth sothat its output has had a chance to settle to its nominal value\nbefore the converter makes its comparison.\nThe circuit in Figure 5 illustrates a settling measurement circuit\nfor evaluating the recovery time of an amplifier from an output\nload current transient. The amplifier is configured as a followerwith a very high speed current generator connected to its output.\nIn this test, a 1 mA transient current was used. As shown in\nFigure 6, the OP285 exhibits an extremely fast recovery time of139 ns to 0.01%. Because of its high gain-bandwidth product,\nhigh open-loop gain, and low output impedance, the OP285 is\nideally suited to drive high speed A/D converters.\nREV.

OP285’s Output Load Current Recovery TimeMeasuring Settling Time\nThe design of OP285 combines high slew rate and wide gain-\nbandwidth product to produce a fast-settling (ts < l µs) amplifier\nfor 8- and 12-bit applications. The test circuit designed to measure\nthe settling time of the OP285 is shown in Figure 7. This test\nmethod has advantages over false-sum node techniques in that\nthe actual output of the amplifier is measured, instead of anerror voltage at the sum node. Common-mode settling effects\nare exercised in this circuit in addition to the slew rate and\nbandwidth effects measured by the false-sum-node method. Ofcourse, a reasonably flat-top pulse is required as the stimulus.\nThe output waveform of the OP285 under test is clamped by\nSchottky diodes and buffered by the JFET source follower.\nThe signal is amplified by a factor of ten by the OP260 andthen Schottky-clamped at the output to prevent overloading\nthe oscilloscope’s input amplifier. The OP41 is configured as\na fast integrator which provides overall dc offset nulling.\nHigh Speed Operation\nAs with most high speed amplifiers, care should be taken with\nsupply decoupling, lead dress, and component placement. Rec-\nommended circuit configurations for inverting and noninvertingapplications are shown in Figures 8 and Figure 9.\n+15V\n+\n2\n38\n1\n4VINVOUT\n–15V10/H9262F\n0.1/H9262F\nRL\n15k/H9024\n0.1/H9262F\n10/H9262F\n+\n–\n1/2\nOP285\nFigure 8.

Unity-Gain Inverter\nIn inverting and noninverting applications, the feedback resis-\ntance forms a pole with the source resistance and capacitance(R\nS and C S) and the OP285’s input capacitance (C IN), as\nshown in Figure 10. With R S and R F in the kilohm range, this\npole can create excess phase shift and even oscillation. A smallcapacitor, C\nFB, in parallel with R FB eliminates this problem. By\nsetting R S (C S + C IN) = R FBCFB, the effect of the feedback pole\nis completely removed.\nCFB\nRFB\nCINVOUT\nRS CS\nFigure 10. Compensating the Feedback Pole\nHigh-Speed, Low-Noise Differential Line Driver\nThe circuit of Figure 11 is a unique line driver widely used inindustrial applications. With ±18 V supplies, the line driver can\ndeliver a differential signal of 30 V p-p into a 2.5 k Ω load. The\nhigh slew rate and wide bandwidth of the OP285 combine toyield a full power bandwidth of 130 kHz while the low noise\nfront end produces a referred-to-input noise voltage spectral\ndensity of 10 nV/ √Hz. The design is a transformerless, balanced\ntransmission system where output common-mode rejection of\nnoise is of paramount importance. Like the transformer-based\ndesign, either output can be shorted to ground for unbalancedline driver applications without changing the circuit gain of 1.\nOther circuit gains can be set according to the equation in the\ndiagram. This allows the design to be easily set to noninverting,inverting, or differential operation.2\n3A2\n13\n2A1\n56\n7\nA3VINVO1\nVO2VO2 – VO1 = V IN\nR2\n2k/H9024\nA1 = 1/2OP285\nA2, A3 = 1/2 OP285GAIN = SET R2, R4, R5 = R1 AND R, R7, R8 = R21\nR1\n2k/H9024R3\n2k/H9024\nR9\n50/H9024\nR11\n1k/H9024\nP1\n10k/H9024\nR12\n1k/H9024R42k/H9024\nR5\n2k/H9024R6\n2k/H9024\nR10\n50/H9024\nR8\n2k/H9024R7\n2k/H9024\nFigure 11. High-Speed, Low-Noise Differential Line Driver\nLow Phase Error Amplifier\nThe simple amplifier configuration of Figure 12 uses the OP285\nand resistors to reduce phase error substantially over a widefrequency range when compared to conventional amplifier designs.\nThis technique relies on the matched frequency characteristics\nof the two amplifiers in the OP285. Each amplifier in the circuit\nhas the same feedback network which produces a circuit gain of\n10. Since the two amplifiers are set to the same gain and are\nmatched due to the monolithic construction of the OP285, theywill exhibit identical frequency response. Recall from feedback\ntheory that a pole of a feedback network becomes a zero in the\nloop gain response. By using this technique, the dominant poleof the amplifier in the feedback loop compensates for the domi-\nnant pole of the main amplifier,\n12\n3A1\n7\nA256R1\n549/H9024R2\n4.99k/H9024\nR3\n499/H9024VINVOUTR5\n549/H9024\nR4\n4.99/H9024\nA1, A2 = 1/2 OP285\nFigure 12.

On the other\nhand, the single gain stage amplifier exhibits 25 ° of phase shift\nover the same frequency range. An additional benefit of the lowphase error configuration is constant group delay, by virtue of\nconstant phase shift at all frequencies below 500 kHz.

With supply voltages of ±15 V, the\noutput voltage compliance of the current pump is ±8 V.

Ω\nThe advantages of a two op amp instrumentation amplifier\nbased on a dual op amp is that the errors in the individual am-plifiers tend to cancel one another. For example, the circuit ’s\ninput offset voltage is determined by the input offset voltagematching of the OP285, which is typically less than 250 µV.\n1\n23A2\nA15\n67VIN\nA1, A2 = 1/2 OP285\nRQ9.98k/H9024+2 GAIN = \nRG(/H9024) \nOPEN\n1.24k\n102\n102\n10\n100\n1000 GAINR1\n4.99k/H9024\nP1\n500/H9024DC CMRR TRIMAC CMRR TRIM\nC1\n5pF–40pF+\n–\nRGR2\n4.99/H9024R3\n4.99k/H9024\nR4\n4.99k/H9024VOUT\nFigure 15. A High-Speed Instrumentation Amplifier\nCommon-mode rejection of the circuit is limited by the matching\nof resistors R1 to R4. For good common-mode rejection, these\nresistors ought to be matched to better than 1%. The circuit was\nconstructed with 1% resistors and included potentiometer P1for trimming the CMRR and a capacitor C1 for trimming the\nCMRR. With these two trims, the circuit ’s common-mode\nrejection was better than 95 dB at 60 Hz and better than 65 dB\nat 10 kHz. For the best common-mode rejection performance,\nuse a matched (better than 0.1%) thin-film resistor network for\nR1 through R4 and use the variable capacitor to optimize thecircuit’ s CMR.\nThe instrumentation amplifier exhibits very wide small- and\nlarge-signal bandwidths regardless of the gain setting, as shown\nin the table. Because of its low noise, wide gain-bandwidthproduct, and high slew rate, the OP285 is ideally suited for high\nspeed signal conditioning applications.\nCircuit      R G   Circuit Bandwidth\nGain          ( /H9024)   V OUT = 100 mV p-p      V OUT = 20 V p-p\n2 Open 5 MHz 780 kHz\n10 1.24 k 1 MHz 460 kHz\n100 102 90 kHz 85 kHz\n1000 10 10 kHz 10 kHz\nREV. COP285\n–11–A 3-Pole, 40 kHz Low-Pass Filter\nThe closely matched and uniform ac characteristics of the OP285\nmake it ideal for use in GIC (Generalized Impedance Converter)\nand FDNR (Frequency Dependent Negative Resistor) filter appli-\ncations. The circuit in Figure 16 illustrates a linear-phase,3-pole, 40 kHz low-pass filter using an OP285 as an inductance\nsimulator (gyrator). The circuit uses one OP285 (A2 and A3)\nfor the FDNR and one OP285 (Al and A4) as an input bufferand bias current source for A3. Amplifier A4 is configured in a\ngain of 2 to set the pass band magnitude response to 0 dB. The\nbenefits of this filter topology over classical approaches arethat the op amp used in the FDNR is not in the signal path and\nthat the filter’ s performance is relatively insensitive to compo-\nnent variations. Also, the configuration is such that large signallevels can be handled without overloading any of the filter ’s\ninternal nodes. As shown in Figure 17, the OP285 ’s symmetric\nslew rate and low distortion produce a clean, well-behavedtransient response.\n1090100\n0%\nSCALE: VERTICAL – 2V/ DIV\nHORIZONTAL – 10 /H9262S/ DIVVOUT\n10V p-p\n10kHz \nFigure 17.
