They provide  exceptional  86 dB common -mode rejection  \nratio  (CMRR)  and high bandwidth while amplifying signals well \nbeyond  the supp ly rails.  The on -chip resist ors are laser  trimmed \nfor gain dr ift of 1 ppm/ °C and high CMRR . The AD8276/AD8277  \nalso have extremely  low gain drift vs. temperature.   \nThe common -mode range of the amplifier s extends to alm ost \ndouble the supply voltage, making t hese amplifiers  ideal for \nsingle- supply  applica tions t hat requ ire a high comm on-mode  \nvoltage range.  The internal resistors and electrostatic discharge \n(ESD ) circuitry at the inputs also provide over voltage protection \nto the op amps.  \nThe AD8276 /AD8277 are  unity-gain stable. Although  they are \noptimized for use as diffe rence amplifiers, they  can also be \nconnected  in high precision, single -ended co nfigurations with \nG = −1, + 1, or +2. The AD827 6/AD8277 provide an integrated  \nprecision solution that has smaller si ze, lower cost, and  improved  \nperformance  than a discre te alter native. \nThe AD8276 /AD8277 operate on single suppl ies (2.0 V to 36 V) \nor dual supplies ( ±2 V to ±18 V). The maximum quiesce nt \nsupply current is 2 00 μA per channel , which is ideal  for battery -\noper ated and port able systems.

D | Page 14 of 22 THEORY OF OPERATION  \nCIRCUIT INFORMATION  \nEach channel of the  AD8276/AD8277 consists  of a low power, low \nnoise op amp and four laser  trimmed on -chip resist ors. These \nresistors can be externall y con nected to m ake a variety o f \namplifier configurations , including differ ence, noninver ting, and \ninverting configurations.  Taking advantage of the integrated  \nresistors of the AD8276 /AD8277  provides the designer with \nseveral benefits  over a discr ete desig n, including smaller size,  \nlowe r cost, and improved ac an d dc performance.  See Figure 1 . \nDC Performance  \nMuch of the dc performance of op amp circuits depends on the \naccurac y of the surroun ding resisto rs. Using  supe rposition t o \nanalyze a typical difference amplifier circuit, as is shown in Figure 39, the output voltage is found to be \n\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb−\uf8f7\uf8f8\uf8f6\uf8ec\uf8ed\uf8eb+\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\uf8eb\n+=− +R3R4VR3R4\nR2 R1R2V VIN IN OUT 1  \nThis equation demonstrates that the gain accuracy and CMRR \nof the AD827 6/AD8277 is determined  primarily by the matching  \nof resistor ratios. Even  a 0.1% misma tch in one resistor degrade s \nthe CMRR to 66 dB for a G = 1 differ ence  amplifier.  \nThe difference amplifier output vol tage equation can be reduced  to  \n( )− +− =NI IN OUT V VR3R4V\nas\n long a s the following ratio of the resistors is tightl y matched:  \nR3R4\nR1R2=\nT\nhe resistors on the AD827 6/AD 8277 are laser trimmed  to match \naccura tely. As a result, the AD8276/AD8277 pr ovide superior \nperformance o ver a discr ete solution, enablin g higher CMRR, \nhigher gain accuracy, and lower gain dr ift, even over a wide \ntemperature range . \nAC Performance  \nComponent s izes and trace lengths are much smaller in an IC \nthan on a PCB, therefore , the corresponding  parasitic elements \nare also sm aller, which re sults in im proved  ac perfo rmance of \nthe AD8276 /AD82 77. For example, the posi tive and negative  \ninput terminals  of the AD 8276/AD8277 op amp s are \nintentionally not pinned out , meaning  that there is no direct \nconnection to the inputs of the amplifier. The o p amps are \nconnected internally through the resistors,  and there is no \ndirect a ccess to the pins. By not connect ing these nodes to the \ntraces on the PCB, the capacitanc e remains low,  resulting in \nimpr oved l oop stability and excellent CMRR over frequ ency of \n86 dB. DRIVING THE AD8276/AD8277 \nCare must  be take n to d rive the AD827 6/AD8 277 with a low \nimpedance source , for example, another amplifier. Source \nresistance  of even a few kilohms  (kΩ) can unbala nce the resis tor \nratios and, therefore , significantly degrade t he gain  accuracy and \nCMRR of the AD827 6/AD8277. Because all configurations \npresent several kilohms of input resistance, the AD8276/AD8277 do  not require a high cur rent drive fr om t he \nsource and  therefore  are easy to dri ve. \nINPUT VOLTAGE RANGE  \nThe AD8276/AD8277  are able to measure input voltages beyond  \nthe supply  rails. The internal resistors divide down the voltage \nbefore it reaches the internal op amp  and provide protection to \nthe op amp inputs . Figure 39 shows an ex ample  of how the  \nvoltage division works in a difference amplifier configuration. \nFor the AD8276 /AD8277  to measure correctly, the input voltage s at \nthe input nodes of the internal op amp must s tay below  1.5 V of \nthe positive s upply rail and can exceed the negative supply rail \nby 0.1 V. Refer to the Power Supplies  section  for more details.  \nR4\nVIN+VIN–R3\nR1\nR2\nR2\nR1 + R2(VIN+)R2\nR1 + R2(VIN+)\n07692-033 \nFigure 39. Voltage Division in the Diff erence Amplifier Configuration  \nThe AD8276/AD8277 have i ntegrated ESD diodes at t he inputs \nthat provide overvoltage protection . This feature simplifies  \nsystem design by eliminating the need for additional external \nprotection circuitry, and enables a more ro bust s ystem .  \nThe v oltages at any  of the inputs of the device s can safely range  \nfrom +V S − 40 V up to −V S + 40 V .  For example, on ±10  V \nsupplies, input voltages can go as high as ±30 V .  Care must  be \ntaken to not exceed the +V S − 40 V to −V S + 40 V input li mits \nto avoid risking damage to the device s. \nData Sheet AD8276/ AD8277 \nRev. D | Page 15 of 22 POWER SUPPLIES  \nThe AD8276/AD8277 operate over a wide range of supply \nvoltages. They can  operate on a single supply as low  as 2 V and \nas high as 36  V , under appropriate setup conditions.  \nFor optimal  performance,  the user must ensure  that the i nternal \nop amp is bi ased correctly  through proper setup conditions . \nThe internal input terminals of the op amp must have sufficient \nvoltage headroom to operate properly.  Proper operation of the \ndevice  requires  at least 1 .5 V between the positive supply rail \nand the op amp input terminals.  This relation ship is expressed \nin the following equation:  \n1.5VREF SR1VVR1 R2× <+ −+\nF\nor example, when operating on a +V S = 2 V single supply  and \nVREF = 0 V , it can be seen  from Figure 40 that the input terminals  \nof the op amp are biased at 0 V , allow ing more than the required \n1.5 V headroom.  However, if  VREF = 1 V under the same  \nconditions , the input terminals of the op amp are  biased at 0.5  V , \nbarely al lowing  the require d 1.5  V headroom.  This setup does \nnot allow any pra ctical volta ge swing on t he noninverting  input.  \nTherefore, the user must  increase the supply voltage or decrease \nVREF to restore proper operation.  The AD8276/AD8277 are typically spe cified at single and dual  \nsupplies , but they  can be used with unb alanced supplie s, as well , \nfor ex ample , −V S = −5 V,  + V S = 20 V.  The diff erence between the \ntwo supplies must be kept b elow 36  V. The positive supply rail \nmust be at least 2  V above the negative supply and reference \nvoltage.  \nR4\nVREFR3\nR1\nR2R1\nR1 + R2(VREF)\nR1\nR1 + R2(VREF)\n07692-032\nF\nigure 40. Ensure Sufficient Volt age H eadroom  on the Internal Op Amp \nInputs  \nUse a  stable dc voltage to power the AD8276/AD8277. Noise on \nthe supply pins can adversely affect performance. P lace a bypass \ncapacitor of 0.1 µF between each supply pin and ground, as \nclose as possible to each s upply  pin. Use a tantalum capacitor  \nof 10  µF between each supply and ground. The tan talum capacitor  \ncan be farther away from the supply pins and, typically, other precision integrated circuits can share the capacitor . \nAD8276/ AD8277 Data Sheet \nRev.

Figur e 47 shows how the AD8276/ AD8277 can be \nused to conve rt a single -ende d output from an  AD8226 \ninstrumen tation amplifier into a differential signal. The internal \nmatched res istors of the AD8276 /AD8277  at the inverting input \nmaximize gain accuracy while genera ting a diff erential signal.

AD8277 Differential Output Configuration  \nThe two  differ ence amplifiers o f the AD8277 can be configured \nto provide a differ ential output , as shown in Figure 48. This \ndifferential output configuration is suitable for various \napplications , such as strain gage  excitation and single -ended-to-\ndifferential c onversion.  The differential output voltage has a \ngain o f 2 as shown in the following equation:  \nVDIFF_OUT  = V+OUT − V−OUT = 2 × (V +IN – V−IN) \nCURRENT SOURCE \nThe AD8276 difference amplifier can be implemented as part  \nof a voltage  to current converter or a precision constant current  \nsource , as shown in  Figure 50. Using an integrated precision  \nsolution such as the AD8276 provides several advantages over  \na discrete solution, including space -saving, improved gain \naccuracy , and temperature drift. The internal  resistors are \ntightly match ed to minimize error and temperature drift. If the \nexter nal r esistors , R1 and R2 , are not well  matched, they become  \na significant source of error in the system . Therefore,  precision \nresistors are recom mended to maintain performance. The \nADR4525 provid es a precision voltage reference that also \nreduces error in the signal chain.  \nThe AD8276 has rail-to-rail output capability  that allows  higher \ncurrent outputs.  VOLTAGE AND  CURRENT  MONITORING  \nVoltage an d current monitoring is critical in  the following \nappli cations:  power line metering , power line  protection,  motor \ncontrol applications , and battery monitoring . The AD8276 / \nAD8277 can be used to monitor voltages and c urrents in a \nsyste m, as shown i n Figure 49. As the signals monitored by the \nAD8276/AD8277  rise above  or drop below critic al levels, a \ncircuit event can be triggered to correct the situation or raise  \na warning .  \nOP1177\n07692-057I1 RAD8276/\nAD8277\nAD8276/\nAD8277\nAD8276/\nAD8277\nAD8276/\nAD8277\nAD8276/\nAD8277I3\nICR\nV1 R\nV3 R\nVC R8:1 ADC\n \nFigure 49.

I1 through I 3 are the curren ts to be monitored, and V 1 \nthrough V 3 are the voltages to be monitored  on each phase.  IC \nand V C are the co mmon or zero  lines. Couplers  or transformers \ninterface the power lines to the front- end circuitry and provide \nattenuation, isolation, and  protection.  \nOn th e curr ent monitoring s ide, current transformers (CTs) \nstep down the power  line current and isolate the front- end \ncircuitry from t he high voltage and high current lines. Across \nthe inputs of each difference amplifier is a shunt resistor that converts the coupled curr ent into a v oltage.
