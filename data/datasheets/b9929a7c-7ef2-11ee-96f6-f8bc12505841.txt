Current sinking capability is24mA at both the A and B ports. The Transmit/Receive(T/R\n) input determines the direction of data flow through\nthe bidirectional transceiver. Transmit (active-HIGH)enables data from A ports to B ports; Receive (active-LOW) enables data from B ports to A ports. The OutputEnable input, when HIGH, disables both A and B portsby placing them in a HIGH Z condition.\n  \nOrdering Information \nDevice also available in Tape and Reel.

### Component Summary: 74AC245MTC

**Description:**
The 74AC245MTC is an octal bidirectional transceiver with 3-state inputs/outputs. It features eight non-inverting buffers that allow for bidirectional data flow, making it suitable for bus-oriented applications. The device can source or sink up to 24mA of current at both the A and B ports. The direction of data flow is controlled by the Transmit/Receive (T/R) input, and the Output Enable (OE) input can disable both ports by placing them in a high-impedance state.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:**
  - Supply Voltage (V_CC): 
    - AC: 2.0V to 6.0V
    - ACT: 4.5V to 5.5V
- **Current Ratings:**
  - DC Output Source/Sink Current: ±50mA
  - A and B outputs can source/sink 24mA
- **Power Consumption:**
  - Quiescent Supply Current (I_CC): 4.0 µA (max) at 5.5V
- **Operating Temperature Range:**
  - Storage Temperature (T_STG): -65°C to +150°C
  - Operating Temperature (T_A): -40°C to +85°C
- **Package Type:**
  - 20-Lead Thin Shrink Small Outline Package (TSSOP), JEDEC MO-153, 4.4mm Wide
- **Special Features:**
  - Non-inverting buffers
  - Bidirectional data path
  - 3-state outputs
  - Reduced I_CC and I_OZ by 50%
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):**
  - MSL Level: 1 (per JEDEC J-STD-020E)

**Typical Applications:**
The 74AC245MTC is commonly used in applications that require data transfer between different buses or systems, such as:
- Data communication interfaces
- Bus-oriented systems
- Microprocessor and microcontroller interfacing
- Memory interfacing
- General-purpose data routing in digital circuits

This component is ideal for scenarios where efficient data transfer and control of multiple data lines are necessary, making it a versatile choice in digital electronics design.
