The temperature shock caused by the application of hot solder\nmay produce fine cracks in the ceramic, resulting in changes in resistance.\nTo prevent leaching of the metallization, solder with silver additives or with a low tin content\nshould be used. In addition, soldering methods should be employed which permit short soldering\ntimes.\n1.3 SMD NTC thermistors\nSMD NTC thermistors can be provided with a nickel barrier termination or on special request with\nsilver-palladium termination. The use of no-clean solder products is recommended. In any case\nmild, non-activated fluxes should be used. Flux residues after soldering should be minimized.\nSMD NTCs with AgPd termination are not approved for lead-free soldering.\nNickel barrier termination\nFigure 1\nSMD NTC thermistors, structure of nickel\nbarrier termination\nThe nickel barrier layer of the silver/nickel/tin termination (see figure 1) prevents leaching of the\nsilver base metallization layer. This allows great flexibility in the selection of soldering parameters.\nThe tin prevents the nickel layer from oxidizing and thus ensures better wetting by the solder. The\nnickel barrier termination is tested for all commonly-used soldering methods according to\nIEC 60068-2-58. Insufficient preheating may cause ceramic cracks. Rapid cooling by dipping in\nsolvent is not recommended.\nThe following test and process conditions apply for nickel barrier termination.Temperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 12 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n1.3.1 Solderability (test to IEC 60068-2-58)\nPreconditioning: Immersion into flux F-SW 32.\nEvaluation criterion: Wetting of soldering areas ≥95%.\nSolder Bath temperature ( °C) Dwell time (s)\nSnPb 60/40 215±3 3±0.3\nSnAg (3.0 ... 4.0), Cu (0.5 ... 0.9) 245±3 3±0.3\n1.3.2 Resistance to soldering heat (test to IEC 60068-2-58)\nPreconditioning: Immersion into flux F-SW 32.\nEvaluation criterion: Leaching of side edges ≤1/3.\nSolder Bath temperature ( °C) Dwell time (s)\nSnPb 60/40 260±5 10±1\nSnAg (3.0 ... 4.0), Cu (0.5 ... 0.9) 260±5 10±1\n1.3.3 Reflow soldering\nTemperature ranges for reflow soldering acc. to IEC 60068-2-58 recommendations.Temperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 13 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\nProfile feature Sn-Pb eutectic assembly Pb-free assembly\nPreheat and soak\n- Temperature min Tsmin 100°C 150°C\n- Temperature max Tsmax 150°C 200°C\n- Time tsminto t smax 60 ... 120 s 60 ... 120 s\nAverage ramp-up rate Tsmaxto T p3°C/ s max. 3°C/ s max.\nLiquidous temperature TL 183°C 217°C\nTime at liquidous tL 40 ... 150 s 40 ... 150 s\nPeak package body temperature Tp 215°C ... 260 °C1)235°C ... 260 °C\nTime above (T P \x045°C) tp 10 ... 40 s 10 ... 40 s\nAverage ramp-down rate Tpto T smax 6°C/ s max. 6°C/ s max.\nTime 25 °C to peak temperature max. 8 minutes max. 8 minutes\n1) Depending on package thickness.\nNotes: All temperatures refer to topside of the package, measured on the package body\nsurface.\nNumber of reflow cycles: 3\nIron soldering should be avoided, hot air methods are recommended for repair\npurposes.\nSolder joint profiles for silver/nickel/tin terminationsTemperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 14 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n1.3.4 Recommended geometry of solder pads\nRecommended maximum dimensions (mm)\nCase size\ninch/mmA B C\n0402/1005 0.6 0.6 1.7\n0603/1608 1.0 1.0 3.0\n0805/2012 1.3 1.2 3.4\n1206/3216 1.8 1.2 4.5\n2 Conductive adhesion\nAn alternative to soldering for silver-palladium terminated components is the gluing of thermistors\nwith conductive adhesives. The benefit of this method is that it involves no thermal stress. The\nadhesives used must be chemically inert.\n3 Clamp contacting\nPressure contacting by means of clamps is particularly suitable for applications involving frequent\nswitching and high turn-on powers.\n4 Robustness of terminations (leaded types)\nThe leads meet the requirements of IEC 60068-2-21. They may not be bent closer than 4 mm\nfrom the solder joint on the thermistor body or from the point at which they leave the feed-\nthroughs. During bending, any mechanical stress at the outlet of the leads must be removed. The\nbending radius should be at least 0.75 mm.Temperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 15 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\nTensile strength: Test Ua1:\nValue of applied force for Ua1 test:\nDiameter (d) of\ncorresponding round leadsForce with tolerance of ±10%\n∅ ≤0.25 mm 1.0 N\n0.25 <∅ ≤0.35 mm 2.5 N\n0.35 <∅ ≤0.50 mm 5.0 N\n0.50 <∅ ≤0.80 mm 10.0 N\nBending strength: Test Ub:\nTwo 90°-bends in opposite directions\nValue of applied force for Ub test:\nDiameter (d) of\ncorresponding round leadsForce with tolerance of ±10%\n∅ ≤0.25 mm 0.5 N\n0.25 <∅ ≤0.35 mm 1.25 N\n0.35 <∅ ≤0.50 mm 2.5 N\n0.50 <∅ ≤0.80 mm 5 N\nTorsional strength: Test Uc: severity 2\nThe lead is bent by 90 °at a distance of 6 to 6.5 mm from the thermistor body.\nThe bending radius of the leads should be approx. 0.75 mm.

During bending the wire must be mechanically relieved at its outlet.\nThe bending radius should be at least 0.75 mm.Temperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 16 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n5 Sealing and potting\nSealing or potting processes can affect the reliability of the component.\nWhen thermistors are sealed, potted or overmolded, there must be no mechanical stress caused\nby thermal expansion during the production process (curing / overmolding process) and during\nlater operation. The upper category temperature of the thermistor must not be exceeded. Ensure\nthat the materials used (sealing / potting compound and plastic material) are chemically neutral.\nAs thermistors are temperature sensitive components it should be considered that molding can af-\nfect the thermal surrounding and may influence e.g. the response time.\nExtensive testing is encouraged in order to determine whether overmolding or potting influences\nthe functionality and/ or reliability of the component.\n6 Cleaning\nCleaning processes can affect the reliability of the component.\nIf cleaning is necessary, mild cleaning agents are recommended. Cleaning agents based on wa-\nter are not allowed. Washing processes may damage the product due to the possible static or\ncyclic mechanical loads (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning). They may cause cracks which might lead to re-\nduced reliability and/ or lifetime.\n7 Storage\nIn order to maintain their solderability, thermistors must be stored in a non-corrosive atmosphere.\nHumidity, temperature and container materials are critical factors.\nDo not store SMDs where they are exposed to heat or direct sunlight.

Do not open the package prior to processing.\nStorage conditions in original packaging: storage temperature \x0425°C ... +45 °C, relative\nhumidity ≤75% annual mean, <95% maximum 30 days per annum, dew precipitation is\ninadmissible.\nDo not store thermistors where they are exposed to heat or direct sunlight. Otherwise, the\npacking material may be deformed or components may stick together, causing problems during\nmounting.\nAvoid contamination of thermistor surface during storage, handling and processing.\nAvoid storage of thermistors in harmful environments like corrosive gases (SO x, Cl etc).\nUse the components as soon as possible after opening the original packaging.\nSolder thermistors within the time specified after shipment from TDK.\nFor leaded components this is 24 months, for SMD components with nickel barrier termination\n12 months, for leadless components this is 12 months, for SMD components with AgPd\ntermination 6 months.\nHandling\nNTC thermistors must not be dropped. Chip-offs or any other damage must not be caused\nduring handling of NTCs.\nDo not touch components with bare hands. Gloves are recommended.\nAvoid contamination of thermistor surface during handling.\nWashing processes may damage the product due to the possible static or cyclic mechanical\nloads (e.g. ultrasonic cleaning). They may cause cracks to develop on the product and its parts,\nwhich might lead to reduced reliability or lifetime.\nBending / twisting leads\nA lead (wire) may be bent at a minimum distance of twice the wire’s diameter plus 4 mm from\nthe component head or housing. When bending ensure the wire is mechanically relieved at the\ncomponent head or housing. The bending radius should be at least 0.75 mm.\nSoldering\nUse resin-type flux or non-activated flux.\nInsufficient preheating may cause ceramic cracks.\nRapid cooling by dipping in solvent is not recommended.\nComplete removal of flux is recommended.Temperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 19 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\nMounting\nEnsure that no thermo-mechanical stress occurs due to production processes (curing or\novermolding processes) when thermistors are sealed, potted or overmolded or during their\nsubsequent operation. The maximum temperature of the thermistor must not be exceeded.\nEnsure that the materials used (sealing/potting compound and plastic material) are chemically\nneutral.\nElectrodes/contacts must not be scratched or damaged before/during/after the mounting\nprocess.\nContacts and housing used for assembly with the thermistor must be clean before mounting.\nEnsure that adjacent materials are designed for operation at temperatures comparable to the\nsurface temperature of the thermistor. Be sure that surrounding parts and materials can\nwithstand the temperature.\nAvoid contamination of the thermistor surface during processing.\nThe connections of sensors (e.g. cable end, wire end, plug terminal) may only be exposed to\nan environment with normal atmospheric conditions.\nTensile forces on cables or leads must be avoided during mounting and operation.\nBending or twisting of cables or leads directly on the thermistor body is not permissible.\nAvoid using chemical substances as mounting aids. It must be ensured that no water or other\nliquids enter the NTC thermistors (e.g. through plug terminals). In particular, water based\nsubstances (e.g. soap suds) must not be used as mounting aids for sensors.\nThe use of no-clean solder products is recommended. In any case mild, non-activated fluxes\nshould be used. Flux residues after soldering should be minimized.\nOperation\nUse thermistors only within the specified operating temperature range.\nUse thermistors only within the specified power range.\nEnvironmental conditions must not harm the thermistors. Only use the thermistors under\nnormal atmospheric conditions or within the specified conditions.\nContact of NTC thermistors with any liquids and solvents shall be prevented. It must be\nensured that no water enters the NTC thermistors (e.g. through plug terminals). For\nmeasurement purposes (checking the specified resistance vs. temperature), the component\nmust not be immersed in water but in suitable liquids (e.g. perfluoropolyethers such as Galden).\nAvoid dewing and condensation unless thermistor is specified for these conditions.\nBending or twisting of cables and/or wires is not permissible during operation of the sensor in\nthe application.\nBe sure to provide an appropriate fail-safe function to prevent secondary product damage\ncaused by malfunction.\nThis listing does not claim to be complete, but merely reflects the experience of TDK.Temperature measurement and compensation B57621C5\nSMD NTC thermistors, case size 1206 (3216) Standard series\nPage 20 of 25 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\nDisplay of ordering codes for TDK Electronics products\nThe ordering code for one and the same product can be represented differently in data sheets,\ndata books, other publications, on the company website, or in order-related documents such as\nshipping notes, order confirmations and product labels.
