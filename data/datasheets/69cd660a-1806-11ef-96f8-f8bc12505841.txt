General Description \nThis product is a 100Gb/s transceiver module designed for optical communication applications compliant \nto 100GBASE-LR4 of the IEEE P802.3ba. The module converts 4 input channels of 25Gb/s electrical data to \n4 channels of LAN WDM optical signals and then multiplexes them into a single channel for 100Gb/s optical \ntransmission. Reversely on the receiver side, the module de-multiplexes a 100Gb/s optical input into 4 \nchannels of LAN WDM optical signals and then converts them to 4 output channels of electrical data. \nThe central wavelengths of the 4 LAN WDM channels are 1295.56, 1300.05, 1304.58 and 1309.14 nm as \nmembers of the LAN WDM wavelength grid defined in IEEE 802.3ba. The high performance cooled LAN \nWDM DFB transmitters and high sensitivity PIN receivers provide superior performance for 100Gigabit \nEthernet applications up to 10km links and compliant to optical interface with IEEE802.3ba Clause 88 \n100GBASE-LR4 requirements. \nThe product is designed with form factor, optical/electrical connection and digital diagnostic interface \naccording to the QSFP+ Multi-Source Agreement (MSA). It has been designed to meet the harshest external \noperating conditions including temperature, humidity and EMI interference. \n2. Functional Description \nThe transceiver module receives 4 channels of 25Gb/s electrical data, which are processed by a 4-channel \nClock and Data Recovery (CDR) IC that reshapes and reduces the jitter of each electrical signal. Subsequently, \neach of 4 DML laser driver IC's converts one of the 4 channels of electrical signals to an optical signal that is \ntransmitted from one of the 4 cooled DML lasers which are packaged in the Transmitter Optical  Sub-\nAssembly (TOSA). Each laser launches the optical signal in specific wavelength specified in IEEE802.3ba \n100GBASE-LR4 requirements. These 4-lane optical signals will be optically multiplexed into a single fiber by \na 4-to-1 optical WDM MUX. The optical output power of each channel is maintained constant \n\n100G QSFP28 LR4 Optical Transceiver,(CRQE10-S) \nHot Pluggable, Dual LC, +3.3V, LAN WDM, DML& PIN, Single mode \nPage 2 of 8 by an automatic power control (APC) circuit. The transmitter output can be turned off by TX_DIS hardware \nsignal and/or 2-wire serial interface. \nThe receiver receives 4-lane LAN WDM optical signals. The optical signals are de-multiplexed by a 1-\nto-4 optical DEMUX and each of the resulting 4 channels of optical signals is fed into one of the 4 receivers \nthat are packaged into the Receiver Optical Sub-Assembly (ROSA). Each receiver converts the optical signal \nto an electrical signal. The regenerated electrical signals are retimed and de-jittered and amplified by the RX \nportion of the 4-channel CDR. The retimed 4-lane output electrical signals are compliant with IEEE CAUI-4 \ninterface requirements. In addition, each received optical signal is monitored by the DOM section. The \nmonitored value is reported through the 2-wire serial interface. If one or more received optical signal is \nweaker than the threshold level, RX_LOS hardware alarm will be triggered. \nA single +3.3V power supply is required to power up this product. Both power supply pins VccTx and \nVccRx are internally connected and should be applied concurrently. As per MSA specifications the module \noffers 7 low speed hardware control pins (including the 2-wire serial interface): ModSelL, SCL, SDA, ResetL, \nLPMode, ModPrsL and IntL. \nModule Select (ModSelL) is an input pin. When held low by the host, this product responds to 2-wire \nserial communication commands. The ModSelL allows the use of this product on a single 2-wire interface bus \n– individual ModSelL lines must be used. \nSerial Clock (SCL) and Serial Data (SDA) are required for the 2-wire serial bus communication interface \nand enable the host to access the QSFP28 memory map. \nThe ResetL pin enables a complete reset, returning the settings to their default state, when a low level on the \nResetL pin is held for longer than the minimum pulse length. During the execution of a reset the host shall \ndisregard all status bits until it indicates a completion of the reset interrupt. The product indicates this by \nposting an IntL (Interrupt) signal with the Data_Not_Ready bit negated in the memory map. Note that on \npower up (including hot insertion) the module should post this completion of reset interrupt without requiring \na reset. \nLow Power Mode (LPMode) pin is used as TX disable. If the LPMode pin is in the high state, the modulor \nwill tune off the Laser. \nModule Present (Mod PrsL) is a signal local to the host board which, in the absence of a product, is \nnormally pulled up to the host Vcc. When the product is inserted into the connector, it completes the path to \nground through a resistor on the host board and asserts the signal. ModPrsL then indicates its present by \nsetting ModPrsL to a “Low” state. \nInterrupt (IntL) pin is used as RX-LOS. When “Low”, it indicates a RX-LOS assert. Other alarm asserting does \nnot go though IntL pin. \n3.
