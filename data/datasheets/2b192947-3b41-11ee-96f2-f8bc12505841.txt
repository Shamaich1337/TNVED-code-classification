The drive capability of this device \nmay create fast edges into light loads so routing and load conditions should be considered to prevent ringing. \nAdditionally, the outputs of this device are capable of driving larger currents than the device can sustain without \nbeing damaged. It is important for the output power of the device to be limited to avoid damage due to \nover-current. The electrical and thermal limits defined in the Section 6.1 must be followed at all times.\nThe SN74HC74 can drive a load with a total capacitance less than or equal to the maximum load listed in the \nSection 6.9 connected to a high-impedance CMOS input while still meeting all of the datasheet specifications. \nLarger capacitive loads can be applied, however it is not recommended to exceed the provided load value. If \nlarger capacitive loads are required, it is recommended to add a series resistor between the output and the \ncapacitor to limit output current to the values given in the Section 6.1.\n8.3.2 Standard CMOS Inputs\nStandard CMOS inputs are high impedance and are typically modeled as a resistor from the input to ground \nin parallel with the input capacitance given in the Section 6.5. The worst case resistance is calculated with the \nmaximum input voltage, given in the Section 6.1, and the maximum input leakage current, given in the Section \n6.5, using ohm\'s law (R = V ÷ I).\nSignals applied to the inputs need to have fast edge rates, as defined by the input transition time in the Section \n6.3 to avoid excessive current consumption and oscillations. If a slow or noisy input signal is required, a device \nwith a Schmitt-trigger input should be used to condition the input signal prior to the standard CMOS input.SN74HC74, SN54HC74\nSCLS094F – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n10 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC74  SN54HC74\n8.3.3 Clamp Diode Structure\nThe inputs and outputs to this device have both positive and negative clamping diodes as depicted in Figure 8-1 .\nCAUTION\nVoltages beyond the values specified in the Section 6.1 table can cause damage to the device. \nThe recommended input and output voltage ratings may be exceeded if the input and output clamp-\ncurrent ratings are observed.\nGND Logic Input OutputVCCDevice\n-IIK+IIK +IOK\n-IOK\nFigure 8-1.

TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n9.1 Application Information\nToggle switches are typically large, mechanically complex and relatively expensive. It is desirable to use a \nmomentary switch instead because they are small, mechanically simple and low cost. Some systems require a \ntoggle switch\'s functionality but are space or cost constrained and must use a momentary switch instead.\nIf the data input (D) of the D-type flip-flop is tied to the inverted output ( Q), then each clock pulse will cause \nthe value at the output (Q) to toggle. The momentary switch can be debounced and connected through a \nSchmitt-trigger buffer to the clock input (CLK) to toggle the output.\nThis application also utilizes a power-on reset circuit to ensure that the output always starts in the LOW state \nwhen power is applied.\n9.2 Typical Application\nQQ\nCLR OutputR1\nPRER2\nC1\nVCCVCC\nD\nCLKVCC\nR3\nC2  \n  \nFigure 9-1. Typical application schematic\n9.2.1 Design Requirements\n9.2.1.1 Power Considerations\nEnsure the desired supply voltage is within the range specified in the Section 6.3. The supply voltage sets the \ndevice\'s electrical characteristics as described in the Section 6.5.\nThe supply must be capable of sourcing current equal to the total current to be sourced by all outputs of the \nSN74HC74 plus the maximum supply current, I CC, listed in the Section 6.5. The logic device can only source or \nsink as much current as it is provided at the supply and ground pins, respectively. Be sure not to exceed the \nmaximum total current through GND or V CC listed in the Section 6.1.\nTotal power consumption can be calculated using the information provided in CMOS Power Consumption and \nCpd Calculation .\nThermal increase can be calculated using the information provided in Thermal Characteristics of Standard Linear \nand Logic (SLL) Packages and Devices .SN74HC74, SN54HC74\nSCLS094F – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED JUNE 2021 www.ti.com\n12 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC74  SN54HC74\nCAUTION\nThe maximum junction temperature, T J(max) listed in the Section 6.1, is an additional limitation  to \nprevent damage to the device. Do not violate any values listed in the Section 6.1. These limits are \nprovided to prevent damage to the device.\n9.2.1.2 Input Considerations\nUnused inputs must be terminated to either V CC or ground. These can be directly terminated if the input is \ncompletely unused, or they can be connected with a pull-up or pull-down resistor if the input is to be used \nsometimes, but not always. A pull-up resistor is used for a default state of HIGH, and a pull-down resistor is used \nfor a default state of LOW. The resistor size is limited by drive current of the controller, leakage current into the \nSN74HC74, as specified in the Section 6.5, and the desired input transition rate. A 10-k Ω resistor value is often \nused due to these factors.\nThe SN74HC74 has standard CMOS inputs, so input signal edge rates cannot be slow. Slow input edge rates \ncan cause oscillations and damaging shoot-through current. The recommended rates are defined in the Section \n6.3.\nRefer to the Section 8.3 for additional information regarding the inputs for this device.\n9.2.1.3 Output Considerations\nThe positive supply voltage is used to produce the output HIGH voltage. Drawing current from the output will \ndecrease the output voltage as specified by the V OH specification in the Section 6.5. Similarly, the ground voltage \nis used to produce the output LOW voltage. Sinking current into the output will increase the output voltage as \nspecified by the V OL specification in the Section 6.5.\nUnused outputs can be left floating. Do not connect outputs directly to V CC or ground.\nRefer to Section 8.3 for additional information regarding the outputs for this device.\n9.2.1.4 Timing Considerations\nThe SN74HC74 is a clocked device. As such, it requires special timing considerations to ensure normal \noperation.\nPrimary timing factors to consider:\n•Maximum clock frequency: the maximum operating clock frequency defined in Section 6.7 is the maximum \nfrequency at which the device is guaranteed to function. This value refers specifically to the triggering \nwaveform, measuring from one trigger level to the next.\n•Pulse duration: ensure that the triggering event duration is larger than the minimum pulse duration, as \ndefined in the Section 6.7.\n•Setup time: ensure that the data has changed at least one setup time prior to the triggering event, as defined \nin the Section 6.7.\n•Hold time: ensure that the data remains in the desired state at least one hold time after the triggering event, \nas defined in the Section 6.7.\n9.2.2 Detailed Design Procedure\n1.Add a decoupling capacitor from V CC to GND. The capacitor needs to be placed physically close to the \ndevice and electrically close to both the V CC and GND pins. An example layout is shown in the Section 11.\n2.Ensure the capacitive load at the output is ≤ 70 pF. This is not a hard limit, however it will ensure optimal \nperformance. This can be accomplished by providing short, appropriately sized traces from the SN74HC74 \nto the receiving device.\n3.Ensure the resistive load at the output is larger than (V CC / IO(max)) Ω. This will ensure that the maximum \noutput current from the Section 6.1 is not violated. Most CMOS inputs have a resistive load measured in \nmegaohms; much larger than the minimum calculated above.www.ti.comSN74HC74, SN54HC74\nSCLS094F – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED JUNE 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 13\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC74  SN54HC74\n4.Thermal issues are rarely a concern for logic gates, however the power consumption and thermal increase \ncan be calculated using the steps provided in the application report, CMOS Power Consumption and Cpd \nCalculation\n9.2.3 Application Curves\nTime (100 Ps/div)Voltage (2 V/div)\nD001 D001Vout\nVin\nFigure 9-2.

Each V CC terminal should have a bypass capacitor to prevent power disturbance. A 0.1- μF \ncapacitor is recommended for this device. It is acceptable to parallel multiple bypass caps to reject different \nfrequencies of noise. The 0.1- μF and 1- μF capacitors are commonly used in parallel. The bypass capacitor \nshould be installed as close to the power terminal as possible for best results, as shown in Figure 11-1 .www.ti.comSN74HC74, SN54HC74\nSCLS094F – DECEMBER 1982 – REVISED JUNE 2021\nCopyright © 2021 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 15\nProduct Folder Links: SN74HC74  SN54HC74\n11 Layout\n11.1 Layout Guidelines\nWhen using multiple-input and multiple-channel logic devices inputs must not ever be left floating. In many \ncases, functions or parts of functions of digital logic devices are unused; for example, when only two inputs of \na triple-input AND gate are used. Such unused input pins must not be left unconnected because the undefined \nvoltages at the outside connections result in undefined operational states. All unused inputs of digital logic \ndevices must be connected to a logic high or logic low voltage, as defined by the input voltage specifications, to \nprevent them from floating. The logic level that must be applied to any particular unused input depends on the \nfunction of the device. Generally, the inputs are tied to GND or V CC, whichever makes more sense for the logic \nfunction or is more convenient.\n11.2 Layout Example\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n714\n13\n12\n11\n10\n9\n81CLR\n1D\n1PRE\n1Q\n1QGND V CC\n2CLR\n2D\n2PRE\n2Q\n2Q GNDVCC\n2CLK1CLK0.1 \x1dF\nUnused input \ntied to GNDBypass capacitor \nplaced close to the \ndevice\nAvoid 90°  \ncorners for \nsignal linesRecommend GND flood fill for \nimproved signal isolation, noise \nreduction, and thermal dissipation\nUnused output \nleft floatingUnused inputs \ntied to V CC\nFigure 11-1.
