They are perfect for demanding communications applications with AC performance that includes 76.8dB SNR and 90dB spurious free dynamic range (SFDR). Ultralow jitter of 0.07ps\nRMS allows unders-\nampling of IF frequencies with excellent noise performance.\nDC specs include ±2LSB INL (typ), ±0.5LSB DNL (typ) \nand no missing codes over temperature. The transition noise is 3.4LSB\nRMS.\nThe digital outputs can be either full rate CMOS, double data rate CMOS, or double data rate LVDS. A separate output power supply allows the CMOS output swing to range from 1.2V to 1.8V .\nThe ENC\n+ and ENC– inputs may be driven differentially \nor single-ended with a sine wave, PECL, LVDS, TTL, or \nCMOS inputs. An optional clock duty cycle stabilizer al-lows high performance at full speed for a wide range of clock duty cycles.\nL, L T , L TC, L TM, Linear Technology and the Linear logo are registered trademarks of Linear \nTechnology Corporation.

Nominally \nequal to V DD/2. V CM should be used to bias the common \nmode of the analog inputs. Bypass to ground with a 0.1µF \nceramic capacitor .\nAIN+ (Pin 2): Positive Differential Analog Input.\nAIN– (Pin 3): Negative Differential Analog Input.\nGND (Pins 4, 10, 11, 14, 20, 43, Exposed Pad Pin 49): \nADC Power Ground. The exposed pad must be soldered to the PCB ground.\nREFH (Pins 5, 7): ADC High Reference. See the Applica-\ntions Information section for recommended bypassing circuits for REFH and REFL.\nREFL (Pins 6, 8): ADC Low Reference. See the Applications \nInformation section for recommended bypassing circuits for REFH and REFL.\nPAR/SER (Pin 9): Programming Mode Selection Pin. Con-\nnect to ground to enable the serial programming mode. CS, SCK, SDI, SDO become a serial interface that control the A/D operating modes. Connect to V\nDD to enable the \nparallel programming mode where CS, SCK, SDI, SDO \nbecome parallel logic inputs that control a reduced set of the A/D operating modes. PAR/SER should be connected directly to ground or V\nDD and not be driven by a logic signal.\nVDD (Pins 12, 13, 47, 48): Analog Power Supply, 1.7V \nto 1.9V . Bypass to ground with 0.1µF ceramic capacitors.  Adjacent pins can share a bypass capacitor .\nENC\n+ (Pin 15): Encode Input. Conversion starts on the \nrising edge.ENC\n– (Pin 16): Encode Complement Input. Conversion \nstarts on the falling edge. Tie to GND for single-ended \nencode mode.\nCS (Pin 17): Serial Interface Chip Select Input. In serial \nprogramming mode (PAR/SER = 0V), CS is the serial in-\nterface chip select input. When CS is low, SCK is enabled for shifting data on SDI into the mode control registers. In the parallel programming mode (PAR/SER = V\nDD),  \nCS controls the clock duty cycle stabilizer (see Table 2). CS can be driven with 1.8V to 3.3V logic.SCK (Pin 18): Serial Interface Clock Input. In serial programming mode, (PAR/SER = 0V), SCK is the serial interface clock input. In the parallel programming mode (PAR/SER = V\nDD), SCK controls the digital output mode \n(see Table 2). SCK can be driven with 1.8V to 3.3V logic.\nSDI (Pin 19): Serial Interface Data Input. In serial program-\nming mode, (PAR/SER = 0V), SDI is the serial interface data input. Data on SDI is clocked into the mode control registers on the rising edge of SCK. In the parallel program-ming mode (PAR/SER =  V\nDD), SDI can be used together \nwith SDO to power down the part (Table 2). SDI can be driven with 1.8V to 3.3V logic.\nOGND (Pin 31): Output Driver Ground. Must be shorted \nto the ground plane by a very low inductance path. Use multiple vias close to the pin.\nOV\nDD (Pin 32): Output Driver Supply. Bypass to ground \nwith a 0.1µF ceramic capacitor .SDO (Pin 44): Serial Interface Data Output. In serial pro-\ngramming mode, (PAR/SER = 0V), SDO is the optional serial interface data output. Data on SDO is read back from the mode control registers and can be latched on the falling edge of SCK. SDO is an open-drain NMOS output that requires an external 2kΩ pull-up resistor to 1.8V – 3.3V . If readback from the mode control registers is not needed, the pull-up resistor is not necessary and SDO can be left unconnected. In the parallel programming mode (PAR/SER = V\nDD), SDO can be used together with \nSDI to power down the part (Table 2). When used as an input, SDO can be driven with 1.8V to 3.3V logic through a 1kΩ series resistor .\nV\nREF (Pin 45): Reference Voltage Output. Bypass to \nground with a 2.2µF ceramic capacitor . The output voltage \nis nominally 1.25V .\nSENSE (Pin 46):  Reference Programming Pin. Connecting \nSENSE to V DD selects the internal reference and a ±1V input \nrange. Connecting SENSE to ground selects the internal reference and a ±0.5V input range. An external reference between 0.625V and 1.3V applied to SENSE selects an input range of ±0.8 • V\nSENSE . \nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n17\n216543fpin FuncTions\nFULL RATE CMOS OUTPUT MODE\nAll Pins Below Have CMOS Output Levels (OGND to \nOVDD)\nD0 to D15 (Pins 21-28, 33-40): Digital Outputs.

The analog inputs should be driven differentially. The encode input can be driven differentially or single-ended for lower power consumption. The digital outputs can be CMOS, double data rate CMOS (to halve the number of output lines), or double data rate LVDS (to reduce digital noise in the system). Many additional features can be chosen by programming the mode control \nregisters through a serial SPI port.\nANALOG INPUT\nThe analog inputs are differential CMOS sample-and-hold \ncircuits (Figure 2). The inputs should be driven differentially around a common mode voltage set by the V\nCM output \npin, which is nominally V DD/2. For the 2V input range, \nthe inputs should swing from V CM – 0.5V to V CM + 0.5V . \nThere should be 180° phase difference between the inputs.\nSingle-Ended Input\nFor applications less sensitive to harmonic distortion, the A IN+ \ninput can be driven single-ended with a 1V P-P signal centered \naround V CM. The A IN– input should be connected to V CM and  applica Tions inForMaTion\nFigure 2. Equivalent Input CircuitFigure 3.

This lowpass filter isolates the drive circuitry from the A/D sample-and-hold switching, and also limits wideband noise from the drive circuitry. Figure 3  \nshows an example of an input RC filter . The RC component values should be chosen based on the application’s input frequency. \nTransformer Coupled Circuits\nFigure 3 shows the analog input being driven by an RF \ntransformer with a center-tapped secondary. The center tap is biased with V\nCM, setting the A/D input at its optimal \nDC level. At higher input frequencies a transmission line balun transformer (Figures 4 through 6) has better bal-ance, resulting in lower A/D distortion.\nAmplifier Circuits\nFigure 7 shows the analog input being driven by a high \nspeed differential amplifier . The output of the amplifier is AC coupled to the A/D so the amplifier’s output common mode voltage can be optimally set to minimize distortion.\nAt very high frequencies an RF gain block will often have \nlower distortion than a differential amplifier . If the gain block is single-ended, then a transformer circuit (Figures 4 through 6) should convert the signal to differential before driving the A/D.\n25/uni03A9\n25/uni03A925/uni03A925/uni03A950/uni03A9\nAIN+\nAIN–12pF0.1µFVCM\nL TC2165ANALOG\nINPUT0.1µF T1\n1:1\nT1: MA/COM MABAES0060 RESISTORS,\nCAPACITORS ARE 0402 PACKAGE SIZE2165 F030.1µF\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n20\n216543fapplica Tions in ForMaTion\nFigure 4.

The encode inputs should be treated as analog signals—do not route them next to digital traces on the circuit board. There are two modes of operation for the encode inputs: the differential encode mode (Figure 10), and the single-ended encode mode (Figure 11). applica Tions in ForMaTion\nFigure 12. Sinusoidal Encode Drive\nFigure 13. PECL or LVDS Encode Drive\nto ground and ENC+ is driven with a square wave encode \ninput. ENC+ can be taken above V DD (up to 3.6V) so 1.8V \nto 3.3V CMOS logic levels can be used. The ENC+ threshold \nis 0.9V . For good jitter performance ENC+ should have fast \nrise and fall times.\nIf the encode signal is turned off or drops below approxi-\nmately 500kHz, the A/D enters nap mode.\nClock Duty Cycle Stabilizer\nFor good performance the encode signal should have a \n50%(±5%) duty cycle. If the optional clock duty cycle stabilizer circuit is enabled, the encode duty cycle can vary from 30% to 70% and the duty cycle stabilizer will maintain a constant 50% internal duty cycle. If the encode signal changes frequency, the duty cycle stabilizer circuit requires one hundred clock cycles to lock onto the input clock. The duty cycle stabilizer is enabled by mode control register A2 (serial programming mode), or by CS (parallel \nprogramming mode).\nFor applications where the sample rate needs to be changed \nquickly, the clock duty cycle stabilizer can be disabled.

Equivalent Encode Input Circuit for Single-Ended Encode Mode.\nThe differential encode mode is recommended for sinu-\nsoidal, PECL, or LVDS encode inputs (Figures 12, 13).  The encode inputs are internally biased to 1.2V through 10kΩ equivalent resistance. The encode inputs can be taken above V\nDD (up to 3.6V), and the common mode \nrange is from 1.1V to 1.6V . In the differential encode mode, ENC\n– should stay at least 200mV above ground to \navoid falsely triggering the single-ended encode mode. For good jitter performance ENC\n+ and ENC– should have \nfast rise and fall times.\nThe single ended encode mode should be used with CMOS \nencode inputs. To select this mode, ENC– is connected \nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n23\n216543fapplica Tions inForMaTion\nto make the sampling clock have a 50%(±5%) duty cycle. \nThe duty cycle stabilizer should not be used below 5Msps.\nDIGITAL OUTPUTS\nDigital Output Modes\nThe L TC2165/L TC2164/L TC2163 can operate in three digital \noutput modes: full rate CMOS, double data rate CMOS (to halve the number of output lines), or double data rate LVDS (to reduce digital noise in the system.) The output mode is set by mode control register A3 (serial programming mode), or by SCK (parallel programming mode). Note that double data rate CMOS cannot be selected in the parallel programming mode.\nFull Rate CMOS Mode\nIn full rate CMOS mode the data outputs (D0 to D15), \noverflow (OF), and the data output clocks (CLKOUT\n+, \nCLKOUT–) have CMOS output levels. The outputs are \npowered by OV DD and OGND which are isolated from the \nA/D core power and ground. OV DD can range from 1.1V \nto 1.9V , allowing 1.2V through 1.8V CMOS logic outputs. \nFor good performance, the digital outputs should drive \nminimal capacitive loads. If the load capacitance is larger than 10pF , a digital buffer should be used.\nDouble Data Rate CMOS Mode\nIn double data rate CMOS mode, two data bits are mul-\ntiplexed and output on each data pin. This reduces the number of digital lines by eight, simplifying board routing and reducing the number of input pins needed to receive the data. The data outputs (D0_1, D2_3, D4_5, D6_7, D8_9, D10_11, D12_13, D14_15), overflow (OF), and the data output clocks (CLKOUT\n+, CLKOUT–) have CMOS output \nlevels. The outputs are powered by OV DD and OGND which \nare isolated from the A/D core power and ground. OV DD \ncan range from 1.1V to 1.9V , allowing 1.2V through 1.8V CMOS logic outputs. \nFor good performance, the digital outputs should drive \nminimal capacitive loads. If the load capacitance is larger than 10pF , a digital buffer should be used.When using double data rate CMOS at sample rates above 100Msps, the SNR may degrade slightly, about 0.2dB to 0.5dB depending on load capacitance and board layout.\nDouble Data Rate LVDS Mode\nIn double data rate LVDS mode, two data bits are multi-\nplexed and output on each differential output pair . There are eight LVDS output pairs (D0_1\n+/D0_1– through D14_15+/\nD14_15–) for the digital output data. Overflow (OF+/OF–) \nand the data output clock (CLKOUT+/CLKOUT–) each have \nan LVDS output pair . \nBy default the outputs are standard LVDS levels: 3.5mA \noutput current and a 1.25V output common mode volt-age. An external 100Ω differential termination resistor is required for each LVDS output pair . The termination resistors should be located as close as possible to the LVDS receiver . \nThe outputs are powered by OV\nDD and OGND which are \nisolated from the A/D core power and ground. In LVDS \nmode, OV DD must be 1.8V . \nProgrammable LVDS Output Current\nIn LVDS mode, the default output driver current is 3.5mA. \nThis current can be adjusted by serially programming mode control register A3. Available current levels are 1.75mA, 2.1mA, 2.5mA, 3mA, 3.5mA, 4mA and 4.5mA.\nOptional LVDS Driver Internal Termination\nIn most cases using just an external 100Ω termination \nresistor will give excellent LVDS signal integrity. In addi-tion, an optional internal 100Ω termination resistor can be enabled by serially programming mode control register A3. The internal termination helps absorb any reflections caused by imperfect termination at the receiver . When the internal termination is enabled, the output driver current is doubled to maintain the same output voltage swing.\nOverflow Bit\nThe overflow output bit outputs a logic high when the \nanalog input is either overranged or underranged. The overflow bit has the same pipeline latency as the data bits. \nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n24\n216543fPhase-Shifting the Output Clock\nIn full rate CMOS mode the data output bits normally \nchange at the same time as the falling edge of CLKOUT+, \nso the rising edge of CLKOUT+ can be used to latch the \noutput data. In double data rate CMOS and LVDS modes the data output bits normally change at the same time as the falling and rising edges of CLKOUT\n+. To allow adequate \nsetup and hold time when latching the data, the CLKOUT+ \nsignal may need to be phase-shifted relative to the data output bits. Most FPGAs have this feature; this is generally the best place to adjust the timing.\nFigure 14. Phase-Shifting CLKOUTThe L TC2165/L TC2164/L TC2163 can also phase-shift the CLKOUT\n+/CLKOUT– signals by serially programming mode \ncontrol register A2. The output clock can be shifted by 0°, 45°, 90°, or 135°. To use the phase-shifting feature the clock duty cycle stabilizer must be turned on. Another control register bit can invert the polarity of CLKOUT\n+ and \nCLKOUT–, independently of the phase-shift. The combina-\ntion of these two features enables phase-shifts of 45° up to 315° (Figure 14).applica Tions in ForMaTion\nTable 1.

By default the output data format is offset binary. The 2’s complement format can be selected by serially program-ming mode control register A4.\nDigital Output Randomizer\nInterference from the A/D digital outputs is sometimes \nunavoidable. Digital interference may be from capacitive or inductive coupling or coupling through the ground plane. Even a tiny coupling factor can cause unwanted tones in the ADC output spectrum. By randomizing the digital output before it is transmitted off chip, these unwanted tones can be randomized which reduces the unwanted tone amplitude.\nThe digital output is randomized by applying an exclusive-\nOR logic operation between the LSB and all other data output bits. To decode, the reverse operation is applied —an exclusive-OR operation is applied between the LSB and all other bits. The LSB, OF and CLKOUT outputs are not affected. The output randomizer is enabled by serially programming mode control register A4.\nFigure 15. Functional Equivalent of Digital Output RandomizerFigure 16. Unrandomizing a Randomized Digital Output Signal\nAlternate Bit Polarity\nAnother feature that reduces digital feedback on the circuit \nboard is the alternate bit polarity mode. When this mode is enabled, all of the odd bits (D1, D3, D5, D7, D9, D11, D13, D15) are inverted before the output buffers. The even bits (D0, D2, D4, D6, D8, D10, D12, D14), OF and CLKOUT are not affected. This can reduce digital currents in the circuit board ground plane and reduce digital noise, particularly for very small analog input signals.\nWhen there is a very small signal at the input of the A/D \nthat is centered around mid-scale, the digital outputs toggle between mostly 1’s and mostly 0’s. This simultaneous switching of most of the bits will cause large currents in the ground plane. By inverting every other bit, the alternate bit polarity mode makes half of the bits transition high while half of the bits transition low. This cancels current flow in the ground plane, reducing the digital noise.\nCLKOUT CLKOUT\nOF\nD15/D0\nD14/D0\n•\n••\nD2/D0\nD1/D0\nD0\n2165 F15OF\nD15\nD14\nD2\nD1\nD0RANDOMIZER\nOND13FPGAPC BOARD\nD12\n•\n••\nD2\nD1\nD0\n2165 F16D0D1/D0D2/D0D12/D0D13/D0OFCLKOUT\nL TC2165\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n26\n216543fThe digital output is decoded at the receiver by inverting \nthe odd bits (D1, D3, D5, D7, D9, D11, D13, D15.) The alternate bit polarity mode is independent of the digital output randomizer—either , both or neither function can be on at the same time. The alternate bit polarity mode is enabled by serially programming mode control register A4.\nDigital Output Test Patterns\nTo allow in-circuit testing of the digital interface to the \nA/D, there are several test modes that force the A/D data outputs (OF , D15 to D0) to known values:\nAll 1s: all outputs are 1\nAll 0s: all outputs are 0Alternating: outputs change from all 1s to all 0s on \nalternating samples.\nCheckerboard: outputs change from \n10101010101010101 to 01010101010101010  on alternating samples.\nThe digital output test patterns are enabled by serially programming mode control register A4. When enabled, the test patterns override all other formatting modes: 2’s complement, randomizer , alternate bit polarity.\nOutput Disable\nThe digital outputs may be disabled by serially program-\nming mode control register A3. All digital outputs includ-ing OF and CLKOUT are disabled. The high-impedance disabled state is intended for in-circuit testing or long periods of inactivity—it is too slow to multiplex a data bus between multiple converters at full speed. When the outputs are disabled the ADC should be put into either sleep or nap mode.\nSleep and Nap Modes\nThe A/D may be placed in sleep or nap modes to conserve \npower . In sleep mode the entire device is powered down, resulting in 1mW power consumption. The amount of time required to recover from sleep mode depends on the size of the bypass capacitors on V\nREF, REFH, and \nREFL. For the suggested values in Figure 8, the A/D will stabilize after 2ms.applica Tions in ForMaTion\nIn nap mode the A/D core is powered down while the internal reference circuits stay active, allowing faster wake-up than from sleep mode. Recovering from nap mode requires at least 100 clock cycles. If the application demands very accurate DC settling then an additional 50µs should be allowed so the on-chip references can settle from the slight temperature shift caused by the change in supply current as the A/D leaves nap mode. \nSleep mode and nap mode are enabled by mode control \nregister A1 (serial programming mode), or by SDI and SDO (parallel programming mode).\nDEVICE PROGRAMMING MODES\nThe operating modes of the L TC2165/L TC2164/L TC2163 \ncan be programmed by either a parallel interface or a simple serial interface. The serial interface has more flex-ibility and can program all available modes. The parallel interface is more limited and can only program some of the more commonly used modes. \nParallel Programming Mode\nTo use the parallel programming mode, PAR/SER should \nbe tied to V\nDD. The CS, SCK, SDI and SDO pins are binary \nlogic inputs that set certain operating modes. These pins can be tied to V\nDD or ground, or driven by 1.8V , 2.5V , or \n3.3V CMOS logic. When used as an input, SDO should be driven through a 1kΩ series resistor . Table 2 shows the modes set by CS, SCK, SDI and SDO.\nTable 2.

The CS, SCK, SDI and SDO pins become a serial interface that program the A/D mode control registers. Data is written to a register with a 16-bit serial word. Data can also be read back from a register to verify its contents.\nSerial data transfer starts when CS is taken low. The data \non the SDI pin is latched at the first 16 rising edges of SCK. Any SCK rising edges after the first 16 are ignored. The data transfer ends when CS is taken high again.\nThe first bit of the 16-bit input word is the R/W bit. The \nnext seven bits are the address of the register (A6:A0). The final eight bits are the register data (D7:D0).\nIf the R/W bit is low, the serial data (D7:D0) will be writ-\nten to the register set by the address bits (A6:A0). If the R/W bit is high, data in the register set by the address bits (A6:A0) will be read back on the SDO pin (see the Timing Diagrams). During a read back command the register is not updated and data on SDI is ignored.\nThe SDO pin is an open drain output that pulls to ground \nwith a 200Ω impedance. If register data is read back through SDO, an external 2k pull-up resistor is required. If serial data is only written and read back is not needed, then SDO can be left floating and no pull-up resistor is needed.\nTable 3 shows a map of the mode control registers.\nSoftware Reset\nIf serial programming is used, the mode control registers \nshould be programmed as soon as possible after the power supplies turn on and are stable. The first serial command must be a software reset which will reset all register data bits to logic 0. To perform a software reset, bit D7 in the reset register is written with a logic 1. After the reset SPI write command is complete, bit D7 is automatically set back to zero.applica Tions inForMaTion\nTable 3.

A multilayer board with an internal ground plane is recommended. Layout for the printed circuit board should ensure that digital and analog signal lines are separated as much as possible. In particular , care should be taken not to run any digital track alongside an analog signal track or underneath the ADC.\nHigh quality ceramic bypass capacitors should be used at \nthe V\nDD, OV DD, VCM, VREF, REFH and REFL pins. Bypass \ncapacitors must be located as close to the pins as pos-sible. Size 0402 ceramic capacitors are recommended. The traces connecting the pins and bypass capacitors must be kept short and should be made as wide as possible.\nOf particular importance is the capacitor between REFH \nand REFL. This capacitor should be on the same side of applica Tions in ForMaTion\nthe circuit board as the A/D, and as close to the device as possible. A low inductance interdigitated capacitor is suggested for REFH/REFL if the sampling frequency is greater than 110Msps.  \nThe analog inputs, encode signals, and digital outputs \nshould not be routed next to each other . Ground fill and grounded vias should be used as barriers to isolate these signals from each other .\nHEAT TRANSFER\nMost of the heat generated by the L TC2165/L TC2164/\nL TC2163 is transferred from the die through the bottom-side exposed pad and package leads onto the printed circuit board. For good electrical and thermal performance, the exposed pad must be soldered to a large grounded pad on the PC board. This pad should be connected to the internal ground planes by an array of vias.\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n31\n216543fTypical applica Tions\nSilkscreen Top\nTop Side\n\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n32\n216543fInner Layer 2\nInner Layer 3Typical applica Tions\n\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n33\n216543fInner Layer 4\nBottom SideInner Layer 5Typical applica Tions\n\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n34\n216543fTypical applica Tions\nVCM\nAIN+\nAIN–\nGND\nREFHREFLREFHREFLPAR/SERGNDGNDV\nDDAIN+\nAIN–\nPAR/SERD11D10\nD9D8\nOV\nDD\nOGND\nCLKOUT+\nCLKOUT–\nD7D6D5D4123456789\n101112363534333231302928272625\nSPI PORT2165 TA02GND ENC+ENC–CS SCK SDI VDDVDDD0 D1 D2 D3\n24 23 22 21 19 18 17 16 15 1437 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 46 47 45 48\n13VDDVDD\nVDDSENSE V REFSDOSDO\nGND OF D15 DNC D14 D13 D12\n0VDD\nC37\n0.1µFL TC2165C15\n0.1µF\nC21\n0.1µF\nC18\n0.1µFGND\n20SENSE\nDIGITALOUTPUTS\nC320.1µF\nR51\n100Ω\nENCODE\nCLOCKC28\n0.1µFC190.1µFC23\n2.2µF\nC510.1µF\n+\n–+––+–+\nCN1\nLTC2165/LTC2164/LTC2163\n35\n216543f\nInformation furnished by Linear Technology Corporation is believed to be accurate and reliable.  \nHowever , no responsibility is assumed for its use.
