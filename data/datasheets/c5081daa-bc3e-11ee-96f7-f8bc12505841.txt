Based on the Analog Devices, Inc., \niCoupler® technology, a chip scale dc-to-dc converter provides \nup to 50 mW of regulated, isolated power at 5 V , which eliminates \nthe need for a separate isolated dc-to-dc converter in low power \nisolated designs. The Analog Devices chip scale transformer \niCoupler technology is used both for the isolation of the logic \nsignals as well as for the dc-to-dc converter. The result is a small \nform factor, total isolation solution. \nThe ADuM524x isolators provide two independent isolation \nchannels in a variety of channel configurations, operating from a 5 V input supply. ADuM524x units can be used in combination \nwith other i Coupler products to achieve greater channel counts. \n \n  FUNCTIONAL BLOCK DIAGRAMS \n06014-001GND 4 GND ISO5VIA2 VOA7 DECODE ENCODE\nVIB3 VOB6 DECODE ENCODEVDD1 VISO8 OSC.

B | Page 11 of 16 APPLICATIONS INFORMATION \nDC-TO-DC CONVERTER \nThe dc-to-dc converter section of the ADuM524x works on \nprinciples that are common to most modern power supply \ndesigns. V DD power is supplied to an oscillating circuit that \nswitches current into a chip scale air core transformer. Power is \ntransferred to the secondary side where it is rectified to a high \ndc voltage. The power is then linearly regulated down to about 5.2 V and supplied to the secondary side data section and to the V\nISO pin for external use. This design allows for a physically \nsmall power section compatible with the 8-lead SOIC packaging of this device. Active feedback was not implemented in this \nversion of iso Power for reasons of size and cost. \nBecause the oscillator runs at a constant high frequency inde-\npendent of the load, excess power is internally dissipated in the \noutput voltage regulation process. Limited space for transformer \ncoils and components also adds to internal power dissipation. This results in low power conversion efficiency, especially at low \nload currents.  \nThe load characteristic curve in Figure 8 shows that the V\nDD \ncurrent is typically 80 mA with no V ISO load and 110 mA at full \nVISO load at the V DD supply pin. \nAlternate supply architectures are possible using this technology. \nAddition of a digital feedback path allows regulation of power \non the primary side. Feedback would allow significantly higher \npower, efficiency, and synchronization of multiple supplies at the \nexpense of size and cost. Future implementations of iso Power \nincludes feedback to achieve these performance improvements. \nThe ADuM524x can be operated with the internal dc-to-dc \nenabled or disabled. With the internal dc-to-dc converter enabled, the isolated supply of Pin 8 provides the output power \nas well as power to the secondary-side circuitry of the part. \nThe internal dc-to-dc converter state of the ADuM524x is \ncontrolled by the input V\nDD voltage, as defined in Table 6. In \nnormal operating mode, V DD is set between 4.5 V and 5.5 V and \nthe internal dc-to-dc converter is enabled. When/if it is desired to disable the dc-to-dc converter, V\nDD is lowered to a value \nbetween 2.7 V and 4.0 V . In this mode, V ISO power is supplied \nexternally by the user and the signal channels of the ADuM524x \ncontinue to operate normally. \nThere is hysteresis into the V DD input voltage detect circuit. \nOnce the dc-to-dc converter is active, the input voltage must be \ndecreased below the turn-on threshold to disable the converter. \nThis feature ensures that the converter does not go into \noscillation due to noisy input power. PROPAGATION DELAY-RELATED PARAMETERS \nPropagation delay is a parameter that describes the time it takes \na logic signal to propagate through a component. The propagation \ndelay to a logic low output may differ from the propagation \ndelay to a logic high. \nINPUT ( VIx)\nOUTPUT (VOx)tPLH tPHL\n50%50%\n06014-012 \nFigure 12. Propagation Delay Parameters \nPulse width distortion is the maximum difference between \nthese two propagation delay values and is an indication of how \naccurately the timing of the input signal is preserved.  \nChannel-to-channel matching refers to the maximum amount \nthe propagation delay differs between channels within a single \nADuM524x component.  \nPropagation delay skew refers to the maximum amount the \npropagation delay differs between multiple ADuM524x \ncomponents operating under the same conditions. \nDC CORRECTNESS AND MAGNETIC FIELD \nIMMUNITY \nPositive and negative logic transitions at the isolator input cause \nnarrow (~1 ns) pulses to be sent to the decoder via the transformer. \nThe decoder is bistable and is, therefore, either set or reset by the pulses, indicating input logic transitions. In the absence of \nlogic transitions at the input for more than 1 μs, a periodic set \nof refresh pulses indicative of the correct input state are sent to ensure dc correctness at the output. If the decoder receives no internal pulses of more than about 5 μs, the input side is assumed to be unpowered or nonfunctional, in which case the isolator \noutput is forced to a default state by the watchdog timer circuit \n(see Table 12 through Table 14). \nThe limitation on the magnetic field immunity of the ADuM524x \nis set by the condition in which induced voltage in the receiving coil of the transformer is sufficiently large to either falsely set or reset the decoder. The following analysis defines the conditions under which this may occur. The 3 V operating condition of the \nADuM524x is examined because it represents the most susceptible \nmode of operation. \nThe pulses at the transformer output have an amplitude greater \nthan 1.0 V . The decoder has a sensing threshold at about 0.5 V , thus establishing a 0.5 V margin in which induced voltages can be \ntolerated. The voltage induced across the receiving coil is given by \nV = (−dβ/dt )Σπr\nn2; n = 1, 2, … , N \nwhere: \nβ is magnetic flux density (gauss). \nN is the number of turns in the receiving coil. \nrn is the radius of the nth turn in the receiving coil (cm). \nADuM5240/ADuM5241/ADuM5242  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. B | Page 12 of 16 Given the geometry of the receiving coil in the ADuM524x and \nan imposed  requirement that the induced voltage be at most \n50% of the 0.5 V margin at the decoder, a maximum allowable \nmagnetic field is calculated , as shown in Figure 13.  \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)100MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE MAGNETIC FLUX\nDENSITY (kgauss)\n0.001\n1M10\n0.01\n1k 10k 10M0.11\n100M 100k\n06014-013 \nFigure 13. Maximum Allowable External M agnetic Flux Density  \nFor example, at a magnetic field frequency of 1 MHz, the maximum allowable magnetic field of 0.2 kgauss induces a  voltage of 0.25 V at the receiving coil. This is about 50% of the \nsensing threshold and does not cause a faulty output t ransition. \nSimilarly, if such an event were to occur during a transmitted \npulse (and was of the worst -case polarity), it would reduce the \nreceived pulse from >1.0  V to 0.75 V—still well above the 0.5 V \nsensing threshold of the decoder.  \nThe preceding magnet ic flux density values correspond to \nspecific current magnitudes at given distances from the \nADuM524x transformers. Figure 14 expresses these allowable \ncurrent magnitudes as a function of frequency for selected distances. As show n in Figure 14, the ADuM524x is extremely \nimmune and can only be affected by extremely large currents \noperated at high frequenc ies very close to the component. For \nthe 1 MHz example noted, one would have to place a 0.5 kA \ncurrent 5  mm away from the ADuM524x to affect the operation  \nof the component . \nMAGNETIC FIELD FREQUENCY (Hz)MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE CURRENT (kA)1000\n100\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n1k 10k 100M 100k 1M 10MDISTANCE = 5mmDISTANCE = 1m\nDISTANCE = 100mm\n06014-014 \nFigure 14. Maximum Allowable Current  \nfor Various Current -to-ADuM 524 x Spacings  Note that at combinations of strong magnetic field and high \nfrequency, any loops f ormed by printed circuit board (PCB) \ntraces could induce error voltages sufficiently large enough to \ntrigger the thresholds of succeeding circuitry. Care should be taken in the layout of such traces to avoid this possibility.  \nTHERMAL ANALYSIS  \nEach ADuM524x  component consists of two internal die, \nattached to a split -paddle lead frame.  For the purposes of \nthermal analysis, it is treated as a thermal unit with the highest \njuncti on temperature r eflected in the θJA value in  Table 2. The \nvalue of θJA is based on measurements taken with the par t \nmounted on a JEDEC standard 4 -layer PCB with fine -width \ntraces in still air. Under normal operating conditions , the \nADuM524x opera tes at full load across the full temperature \nrange without derating the output current.  For example, a part \nwith no external load drawing 80  mA and dissipating 400  mW \ncause s a 32°C temperature rise above ambient.  It is normal for \nthese devices to run warm.  \nFollowing the recommendations in the PCB Layout  section \ndecrease s the thermal resistance to the PCB all owing increased \nthermal margin a t high ambient temperatures.  \nPCB LAYOUT  \nThe ADuM524x requires no external circuitry for its lo gic \ninterfaces. Power supply bypassing is required at the input and output supply pins ( see Figure 15).  \nThe power supply section of the ADuM524 x uses a 300 MHz \noscillator frequency to pass power through its chip scale trans -\nform ers. In addition, the normal operation of the data section  \nof the iCoupler  introduces switching transients, as described in \nthe DC Correctness and Magnetic Field Imm unity section, on \nthe power supply pins ( see Figure 11). Low inductance capacitors  \nare required to bypass noise generated at the switching frequency  \nas well as 1  ns pulses generated by the data transfer and dc  refresh  \ncircuitry.  The total lead length between bot h ends of the capacitor  \nand the input power supply pin should not exceed 20 mm . \nIn cases where EMI emission is a concern, series inductance may be added to critical power and ground traces. Discrete inductors  \nshould be added to the line such that the high frequency bypass capacitors are between the inductor and the ADuM524x device \npin. Inductance can be added in the form of discrete inductors \nor ferrite beads added to both power and ground traces. The \nrecommended value corresponds to impedance between 50  Ω \nand 100 Ω at approximately 300  MHz.  \nIf the switching speed of the data outputs is causing unacceptable  \nEMI, capacitance to ground can be added at output pins to slow \nthe rise and fall time of the output.  This slew rate limits the output.  \nCapacitance values  depend on application speed requirements.  \nSee the AN -0971 Application Note  for board layout guidelines. \n \n \nData Sheet ADuM5240/ADuM5241/ADuM5242\n \nRev. B | Page 13 of 16 Load regulation transients are the primary source of lower \nfrequency power supply voltage excursions, as illustrated in Figure 10. These should be dealt with by adding an additional supply stiffening capacitor between V\nISO and GND ISO. The \nstiffening capacitor can be of a more highly inductive type because the high frequency bypass is handled by the required \nlow inductance capacitor. \n06014-015VDD\nVIA/OA\nVIB/OB\nGNDVISO\nVOA/IA\nVOB/IB\nGND ISO100nF\n100nF\nOPT\n \nFigure 15. Recommended Printed Circuit Board Layout \nIn applications involving high common-mode transients, care \nshould be taken to ensure that board coupling across the isolation barrier is minimized. Furthermore, the board layout should be \ndesigned such that any coupling that does occur equally affects \nall pins on a given component side. Failure to ensure this can cause voltage differentials between pins exceeding the absolute maximum ratings of the device (specified in Table 7), thereby \nleading to latch-up and/or permanent damage. \nThe ADuM524x is a power device that dissipates as much as \n600 mW of power when fully loaded. Because it is not possible \nto apply a heat sink to an isolation device, the device primarily \ndepends on heat dissipation into the PCB through the GND pins. If the device is used at high ambient temperatures, care should be taken to provide a thermal path from the GND pins to the PCB ground plane. The board layout in Figure 15 shows \nenlarged pads for Pin 4 and Pin 5. Multiple vias should be \nimplemented from each of the pads to the ground plane,  which significantly reduce the temperatures inside the chip.  The dimensions of the expanded pads are left to the discretion \nof the designer and the available board space. \nINCREASING AVAILABLE POWER \nThe ADuM524x devices are not designed with the capability of \nrunning several devices in parallel. However, if more power is \nrequired to run multiple loads, it is possible to group loads and \nrun each group from an individual ADuM542x device. For example, if a transceiver and external logic must be powered, one ADuM524x could be dedicated to the transceiver and an additional ADuM524x could power the external logic, which \nprevents issues with load sharing because each load is dedicated \nto its own supply. \nINSULATION LIFETIME \nAll insulation structures eventually breaks down when subjected \nto voltage stress over a sufficiently long period. The rate of \ninsulation degradation is dependent on the characteristics of the voltage waveform applied across the insulation. In addition to the testing performed by the regulatory agencies, Analog Devices carries out an extensive set of evaluations to determine the lifetime of the insulation structure within the ADuM524x. Analog Devices performs accelerated life testing using voltage levels higher than the rated continuous working voltage. Accel-eration factors for several operating conditions are determined. \nThese factors allow calculation of the time to failure at the actual \nworking voltage. The values shown in Table 8 summarize the peak voltage for 50 years of service life for a bipolar ac operating condi-tion and the maximum CSA/VDE approved working voltages. In many cases, the approved working voltage is higher than 50-year \nservice life voltage. Operation at these high working voltages \ncan lead to shortened insulation life in some cases. \nThe insulation lifetime of the ADuM524x depends on the voltage \nwaveform type imposed across the isolation barrier. The iCoupler \ninsulation structure degrades at different rates depending on \nwhether the waveform is bipolar ac, unipolar ac, or dc. Figure 16, Figure 17, and Figure 18 illustrate these different isolation \nvoltage waveforms. \nBipolar ac voltage is the most stringent environment. The goal \nof a 50-year operating lifetime under the ac bipolar condition determines the recommended maximum working voltage of Analog Devices. \nIn the case of unipolar ac or dc voltage, the stress on the \ninsulation is significantly lower, which allows operation at \nhigher working voltages while still achieving a 50-year service life. The working voltages listed in Table 8 can be applied while maintaining the 50-year minimum lifetime provided the voltage conforms to either the unipolar ac or dc voltage cases. Any cross-\ninsulation voltage waveform that does not conform to Figure 17 or \nFigure 18 should be treated as a bipolar ac waveform, and its peak voltage should be limited to the 50-year lifetime voltage \nvalue listed in Table 8. \nNote that the voltage presented in Figure 17 is shown as sinusoidal \nfor illustration purposes only. It is meant to represent any voltage waveform varying between 0 V and some limiting value. \nThe limiting value can be positive or negative, but the voltage \ncannot cross 0 V . \n0VRATED PEAK VOLTAGE\n06014-021 \nFigure 16.
