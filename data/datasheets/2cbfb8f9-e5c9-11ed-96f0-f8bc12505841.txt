This will help to minimize \nthe parasitic inductance and capacitance ef fects. Locate termination at the received signal end of the transmission line. The \nlength of these lines should be kept short and of equal length.  \n(2) For the high speed signal lines, differential signals should  be used, not single-ended signals, and these differential sign als \nneed to be loaded symmetrically to prevent unbalan ced currents which will cause distortion in the signal.  \n(3) Multi layer plane PCB is best for distribution of VCC, returning ground currents, forming transmission lines and shielding, \nAlso, it is important to suppress noise fr om influencing the fiber-op tic transceiver performance, especially the receiver \ncircuit.  \n(4) A separate proper power supply filte r circuits shown in Figure for the tran smitter and receiver sections. These filter \ncircuits suppress Vcc  noise over a broad frequency range, this prev ents receiver sensitivity degradation due to VCC noise.  \n(5) Surface-mount components are recommended. Use ceramic bypass capacitors for the 0.1 µF capacitors and a \nsurface-mount coil inductor for 1 µH inductor. Ferrite beads can be used to replace the coil inductors when using quieter  \nVCC supplies, but a coil inductor is reco mmended over a ferrite bead. All power supply components need to be placed \nphysically next to the VCC pins of the receiver and transmitter.  \n(6) Use a good, uniform ground plane with a minimum number of  holes to provide a low-indu ctance ground current return \nfor the power supply currents.  \n \n RoHS Compliant \n850 nm Multi-mode Transceiver (1000BASE-SX) \n1×9, ST Duplex Connector, 3.3 V/5V \n1.0625Gbd Fiber Channel/1.25 Gigabit Ethernet \n   \n \nPage 9 of 11 \nVersion 1.1 Date:3/18/2010 \n Website: www.apacoe.com.tw\n \n  \nRecommended Board Layout Hole Pattern \n  \nUnit : mm(inches)  \n \nThis transceiver is compatible with industry standard wave or hand solder processes.
