Internal metal electrodes are added  \non each end to make the contacts to  the thick \nfilm resistive element. The  composition of the \nresistive element  is a noble metal imbedded into a  \nglass and covered by a second glass  to prevent \nenvironmental influences.  The resistor is laser \ntrimmed to the  rated resistance value. The \nresistor  is covered with a protective epoxy  \ncoat, finally the two external  terminations (matte \ntin on Ni -barrier)  are added, as shown in Fig. 9. \nTYPE  L (mm) W (mm) H (mm) I1 (mm) I2
