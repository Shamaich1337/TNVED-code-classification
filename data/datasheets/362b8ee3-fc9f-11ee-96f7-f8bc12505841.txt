D For more information www.analog.com\n Document Feedback\nAdjustable1.1A Single Resistor \nLow Dropout Regulator\nThe LT®3080  is a 1.1A low dropout linear regulator that \ncan be paralleled to increase output current or spread \nheat in surface mounted boards. Architected as a preci -\nsion current source and voltage follower allows this new \nregulator to be used in many applications requiring high \ncurrent, adjustability to zero, and no heat sink. Also the \ndevice brings out the collector of the pass transistor to \nallow low dropout operation —down to 350 millivolts — \nwhen used with multiple supplies.\nA key feature of the LT3080  is the capability to supply \na wide output voltage range. By using a reference cur -\nrent through a single resistor , the output voltage is pro -\ngrammed to any level between zero and 36V. The LT3080  \nis stable with 2.2µF  of capacitance on the output, and \nthe IC uses small ceramic capacitors that do not require \nadditional ESR as is common with other regulators. \nInternal protection circuitry includes current limiting and \nthermal limiting. The LT3080  regulator is offered in the \n8-lead MSOP (with an exposed pad for better thermal \ncharacteristics), a 3mm  × 3mm  DFN, 5-lead DD-Pak,  \nTO-220 and a simple-to-use 3-lead SOT-223 version.\n nHigh Current All Surface Mount Supply\n nHigh Efficiency Linear Regulator\n nPost Regulator for Switching Supplies\n nLow Parts Count Variable Voltage Supply\n nLow Output Voltage Power Supplies nOutputs May Be Paralleled for Higher Current \nand\xa0Heat Spreading\n nOutput Current : 1.1A\n nSingle Resistor Programs Output Voltage\n n1% Initial Accuracy of SET Pin Current\n nOutput Adjustable to 0V\n nLow Output Noise : 40µV RMS (10Hz  to 100kHz )\n nWide Input Voltage Range : 1.2V to 36V\n nLow Dropout Voltage : 350mV  (Except \nSOT-223\xa0Package)\n n<1mV Load Regulation\n n<0.001%/V Line Regulation\n nMinimum Load Current : 0.5mA\n nStable with 2.2µF  Minimum Ceramic Output Capacitor\n nCurrent Limit with Foldback and Overtemperature \nProtected\n nAvailable in 8-Lead MSOP , 3mm  × 3mm  DFN, \n n5-Lead DD-Pak, TO-220 and 3-Lead SOT-223\n nAEC- Q100  Qualified for Automotive Applications\nVariable Output Voltage 1.1A Supply\n+\n–L T3080 IN VIN\n1.2V TO 36V\nVCONTROL\nOUT\n3080 TA01aSET1µF\n2.2µF\nRSET\nVOUT = R SET • 10µAVOUTSet Pin Current Distribution\nSET PIN CURRENT DISTRIBUTION (µA)10.20\n3080 G029.90 10.00 10.10 9.80N = 13792TYPICAL APPLICATIONDESCRIPTION FEATURES\nAPPLICATIONS\nAll registered trademarks and trademarks are the property of their respective owners. \nLT3080\n2\nRev.

Exposure to any Absolute \nMaximum Rating condition for extended periods may affect device \nreliability and lifetime.\nNote 2 : Unless otherwise specified, all voltages are with respect to V OUT. The \nLT3080  is tested and specified under pulse load conditions such that T J ≅ TA. \nThe LT3080 E is 100% tested at T A = 25°C and performance is guaranteed \nfrom 0°C to 125°C. Performance of the LT3080 E over the full –40°C to 125°C \noperating temperature range is assured by design, characterization, and \ncorrelation with statistical process controls. The LT3080 I is guaranteed over \nthe\xa0full –40°C to 125°C operating junction temperature range.\nNote 3 : Minimum load current is equivalent to the quiescent current of \nthe part. Since all quiescent and drive current is delivered to the output \nof the part, the minimum load current is the minimum current required \nto\xa0maintain regulation. \nNote 4 : For the LT3080 , dropout is caused by either minimum control \nvoltage (V CONTROL ) or minimum input voltage (V IN). Both parameters are \nspecified with respect to the output voltage. The specifications represent the \nminimum input-to-output differential voltage required to maintain regulation.\nNote 5 : The V CONTROL  pin current is the drive current required for the \noutput transistor . This current will track output current with roughly a 1 :60 \nratio. The minimum value is equal to the quiescent current of the device.Note 6 : Output noise is lowered by adding a small capacitor across the \nvoltage setting resistor . Adding this capacitor bypasses the voltage setting \nresistor shot noise and reference current noise ; output noise is then equal \nto error amplifier noise (see Applications Information  section).\nNote 7 : SET pin is clamped to the output with diodes. These diodes only \ncarry current under transient overloads.\nNote 8 : Load regulation is Kelvin sensed at the package.\nNote 9 : Current limit may decrease to zero at input-to-output differential \nvoltages (V IN–VOUT) greater than 25V (DFN and MSOP package) or 26V \n(SOT-223, DD-Pak and T0-220 Package ). Operation at voltages for both IN \nand V CONTROL  is allowed up to a maximum of 36V as long as the difference \nbetween input and output voltage is below the specified differential  \n(VIN–VOUT) voltage. Line and load regulation specifications are not \napplicable when the device is in current limit.\nNote 10 : This IC includes overtemperature protection that is intended \nto protect the device during momentary overload conditions. Junction \ntemperature will exceed the maximum operating junction temperature when \novertemperature protection is active. Continuous operation above the specified \nmaximum operating junction temperature may impair device reliability.\nNote 11 : The SOT-223 package connects the IN and V CONTROL  pins \ntogether internally. Therefore, test conditions for this pin follow the \nVCONTROL  conditions listed in the Electrical Characteristics  table.ELECTRICAL CHARACTERISTICS The l denotes the specifications which apply over the full operating \ntemperature range, otherwise specifications are at T A = 25°C.

D For more information www.analog.comThe LT3080  regulator is easy to use and has all the pro -\ntection features expected in high performance regulators. \nIncluded are short-circuit protection and safe operating \narea protection, as well as thermal shutdown.\nThe LT3080  is especially well suited to applications need -\ning multiple rails. The new architecture adjusts down to \nzero with a single resistor handling modern low voltage \ndigital IC ’s as well as allowing easy parallel operation \nand thermal management without heat sinks. Adjusting \nto “zero” output allows shutting off the powered circuitry \nand when the input is pre-regulated —such as a 5V or \n3.3V input supply —external resistors can help spread \nthe heat.\nA precision “0” TC 10µA  internal current source is con -\nnected to the noninverting input of a power operational \namplifier . The power operational amplifier provides a low \nimpedance buffered output to the voltage on the nonin -\nverting input. A single resistor from the noninverting input \nto ground sets the output voltage and if this resistor is set \nto zero, zero output results. As can be seen, any output \nvoltage can be obtained from zero up to the maximum \ndefined by the input power supply.\nWhat is not so obvious from this architecture are the \nbenefits of using a true internal current source as the \nreference as opposed to a bootstrapped reference in \nolder regulators. A true current source allows the regu -\nlator to have gain and frequency response independent \nof the impedance on the positive input. Older adjustable regulators, such as the LT1086  have a change in loop \ngain with output voltage as well as bandwidth changes \nwhen the adjustment pin is bypassed to ground. For the \nLT3080 , the loop gain is unchanged by changing the out -\nput voltage or bypassing. Output regulation is not fixed at \na percentage of the output voltage but is a fixed fraction of \nmillivolts. Use of a true current source allows all the gain \nin the buffer amplifier to provide regulation and none of \nthat gain is needed to amplify up the reference to a higher \noutput voltage.\nThe LT3080  has the collector of the output transistor \nconnected to a separate pin from the control input. Since \nthe dropout on the collector (IN pin) is only 350mV , two \nsupplies can be used to power the LT3080  to reduce dis -\nsipation : a higher voltage supply for the control circuitry \nand a lower voltage supply for the collector . This increases \nefficiency and reduces dissipation. To further spread the \nheat, a resistor can be inserted in series with the collector \nto move some of the heat out of the IC and spread it on \nthe PC board.\nThe LT3080  can be operated in two modes. Three-terminal \nmode has the control pin connected to the power input pin \nwhich gives a limitation of 1.35V  dropout. Alternatively, \nthe “control ” pin can be tied to a higher voltage and the \npower IN pin to a lower voltage giving 350mV  dropout \non the IN pin and minimizing the power dissipation. This \nallows for a 1.1A supply regulating from 2.5V IN to 1.8V OUT \nor 1.8V IN to 1.2V OUT with low dissipation.–+VCONTROLIN\n10µA\n3080 BD\nOUT SETBLOCK DIAGRAM\nAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3080\n10\nRev.

Basic Adjustable Regulator +\n–L T3080 IN\nVCONTROL\nVCONTROL\nOUT\n3080 F01SET\nCOUT\nRSETVOUT\nCSET+\nVIN+\nOutput Voltage\nThe LT3080  generates a 10µA  reference current that flows \nout of the SET pin. Connecting a resistor from SET to \nground generates a voltage that becomes the reference \npoint for the error amplifier (see Figure\xa01 ). The reference \nvoltage is a straight multiplication of the SET pin current \nand the value of the resistor . Any voltage can be gen -\nerated and there is no minimum output voltage for the \nregulator . A minimum load current of 1mA is required to \nmaintain regulation regardless of output voltage. For true \nzero voltage output operation, this 1mA load current must \nbe returned to a negative supply voltage. \nWith the low level current used to generate the refer -\nence voltage, leakage paths to or from the SET pin can \ncreate errors in the reference and output voltages. High \nquality insulation should be used (e.g., Teflon, Kel-F) ; \ncleaning of all insulating surfaces to remove fluxes and \nother residues will probably be required. Surface coating \nmay be necessary to provide a moisture barrier in high \nhumidity\xa0environments.\nBoard leakage can be minimized by encircling the SET \npin and circuitry with a guard ring operated at a potential \nclose to itself ; the guard ring should be tied to the OUT \npin. Guarding both sides of the circuit board is required. \nBulk leakage reduction depends on the guard ring width. \nTen nanoamperes of leakage into or out of the SET pin and \nassociated circuitry creates a 0.1% error in the reference \nvoltage. Leakages of this magnitude, coupled with other \nsources of leakage, can cause significant offset voltage \nand reference drift, especially over the possible operating \ntemperature range.If guard-ring techniques are used, this bootstraps any \nstray capacitance at the SET pin. Since the SET pin is a \nhigh impedance node, unwanted signals may couple into \nthe SET pin and cause erratic behavior . This will be most \nnoticeable when operating with minimum output capaci -\ntors at full load current. The easiest way to remedy this is \nto bypass the SET pin with a small amount of capacitance \nfrom SET to ground, 10pF  to 20pF  is sufficient.\nStability and Output Capacitance\nThe LT3080  requires an output capacitor for stability. It is \ndesigned to be stable with most low ESR capacitors (typ -\nically ceramic, tantalum or low ESR electrolytic). A\xa0min -\nimum output capacitor of 2.2µF  with an ESR of 0.5Ω \nor less is recommended to prevent oscillations. Larger \nvalues of output capacitance decrease peak deviations \nand provide improved transient response for larger load \ncurrent changes. Bypass capacitors, used to decouple \nindividual components powered by the LT3080 , increase \nthe effective output capacitor value.\nFor improvement in transient performance, place a capac -\nitor across the voltage setting resistor . Capacitors up to \n1µF can be used. This bypass capacitor reduces system \nnoise as well, but start-up time is proportional to the time \nconstant of the voltage setting resistor (R SET in Figure\xa01 ) \nand SET pin bypass capacitor .\nExtra consideration must be given to the use of ceramic \ncapacitors. Ceramic capacitors are manufactured with a \nvariety of dielectrics, each with different behavior across \ntemperature and applied voltage. The most common \ndielectrics used are specified with EIA temperature char -\nacteristic codes of Z5U, Y5V , X5R and X7R. The Z5U and \nY5V dielectrics are good for providing high capacitances \nin a small package, but they tend to have strong voltage \nand temperature coefficients as shown in Figure\xa02  and \nFigure\xa03 . When used with a 5V regulator , a 16V 10µF  Y5V \ncapacitor can exhibit an effective value as low as 1µF to \n2µF for the DC bias voltage applied and over the operating \ntemperature range. The X5R and X7R dielectrics result in \nmore stable characteristics and are more suitable for use \nas the output capacitor . The X7R type has better stability \nacross temperature, while the X5R is less expensive and \nis  available in higher values. Care still must be exercised APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3080\n11\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comwhen using X5R and X7R capacitors ; the X5R and X7R \ncodes only specify operating temperature range and max -\nimum capacitance change over temperature. Capacitance \nchange due to DC bias with X5R and X7R capacitors is \nbetter than Y5V and Z5U capacitors, but can still be sig -\nnificant enough to drop capacitor values below appropriate \nlevels. Capacitor DC bias characteristics tend to improve \nas component case size increases, but expected capaci -\ntance at operating voltage should be verified.\nVoltage and temperature coefficients are not the only \nsources of problems. Some ceramic capacitors have a \npiezoelectric response. A piezoelectric device generates \nvoltage across its terminals due to mechanical stress, \nsimilar to the way a piezoelectric microphone works. For a ceramic capacitor the stress can be induced by vibrations \nin the system or thermal transients.\nParalleling Devices\nLT3080 ’s may be paralleled to obtain higher output cur -\nrent. The SET pins are tied together and the IN pins are \ntied together . This is the same whether it ’s in three termi -\nnal mode or has separate input supplies. The outputs are \nconnected in common using a small piece of PC trace as \na ballast resistor to equalize the currents. PC trace resis -\ntance in milliohms/inch is shown in Table\xa01 . Only a tiny \narea is needed for ballasting.\nTable\xa01.

Even with an output voltage as low as 1V, this \nonly adds 1% to the regulation. Of course, more than \ntwo LT3080 ’s can be paralleled for even higher output \ncurrent. They are spread out on the PC board, spreading \nthe heat. Input resistors can further spread the heat if the \ninput-to-output difference is high. \nThermal Performance\nIn this example, two LT3080  3mm  × 3mm  DFN devices \nare mounted on a 1oz copper 4-layer PC board. They are \nplaced approximately 1.5 inches apart and the board is \nmounted vertically for convection cooling. T wo tests were \nset up to measure the cooling performance and current \nsharing of these devices. \nThe first test was done with approximately 0.7V input- \nto-output and 1A per device. This gave a 700 milliwatt \ndissipation in each device and a 2A output current. The \ntemperature rise above ambient is approximately 28°C \nand both devices were within plus or minus 1°C. Both the \nthermal and electrical sharing of these devices is excel -\nlent. The thermograph in Figure\xa05  shows the tempera -\nture distribution between these devices and the PC board \nreaches ambient temperature within about a half an inch \nfrom the devices. \nThe power is then increased with 1.7V across each device. \nThis gives 1.7 watts dissipation in each device and a device temperature of about 90°C, about 65°C above \nambient as shown in Figure\xa06 . Again, the temperature \nmatching between the devices is within 2°C, showing \nexcellent tracking between the devices. The board tem -\nperature has reached approximately 40°C within about \n0.75 inches of each device. \nWhile 90°C is an acceptable operating temperature for \nthese devices, this is in 25°C ambient. For higher ambi -\nents, the temperature must be controlled to prevent \ndevice temperature from exceeding 125°C. A 3-meter-\nper-second airflow across the devices will decrease the \ndevice temperature about 20°C providing a margin for \nhigher operating ambient temperatures. \nBoth at low power and relatively high power levels devices \ncan be paralleled for higher output current. Current \nsharing and thermal sharing is excellent, showing that \nacceptable operation can be had while keeping the peak \ntemperatures below excessive operating temperatures on \na board. This technique allows higher operating current \nlinear regulation to be used in systems where it could \nnever be used before.\nQuieting the Noise\nThe LT3080  offers numerous advantages when it comes \nto dealing with noise. There are several sources of noise \nin a linear regulator . The most critical noise source for any \nLDO is the reference ; from there, the noise contribution \nFigure\xa06. Temperature Rise at 1.7W  Dissipation\n Figure\xa05. Temperature Rise at 700mW  DissipationAPPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3080\n13\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comfrom the error amplifier must be considered, and the gain \ncreated by using a resistor divider cannot be forgotten.\nT raditional low noise regulators bring the voltage refer -\nence out to an external pin (usually through a large value \nresistor) to allow for bypassing and noise reduction of \nreference noise. The LT3080  does not use a traditional \nvoltage reference like other linear regulators, but instead \nuses a reference current. That current operates with typ -\nical noise current levels of 3.2pA /√Hz (1nA RMS over the \n10Hz  to 100kHz  bandwidth). The voltage noise of this is \nequal to the noise current multiplied by the resistor value. \nThe resistor generates spot noise equal to √4kTR   (k = \nBoltzmann ’s constant, 1.38 • 10–23 J/°K, and T is absolute \ntemperature) which is RMS summed with the reference \ncurrent noise. To lower reference noise, the voltage set -\nting resistor may be  bypassed with a capacitor , though \nthis causes start-up time to increase as a factor of the RC \ntime constant.\nThe LT3080  uses a unity-gain follower from the SET pin \nto drive the output, and there is no requirement to use \na resistor to set the output voltage. Use a high accuracy \nvoltage reference placed at the SET pin to remove the \nerrors in output voltage due to reference current tolerance \nand resistor tolerance. Active driving of the SET pin is \nacceptable ; the limitations are the creativity and ingenuity \nof the circuit designer .\nOne problem that a normal linear regulator sees with \nreference voltage noise is that noise is gained up along \nwith the output when using a resistor divider to operate \nat levels higher than the normal reference voltage. With \nthe LT3080 , the unity-gain follower presents no gain \nwhatsoever from the SET pin to the output, so noise fig -\nures do not increase accordingly. Error amplifier noise is \ntypically 125nV /√Hz (40µV RMS over the 10Hz  to 100kHz  \nbandwidth) ; this is  another factor that is RMS summed \nin to give a final noise figure for the regulator . \nCurves in the Typical Performance Characteristics show \nnoise spectral density and peak-to-peak noise character -\nistics for both the reference current and error amplifier \nover the 10Hz  to 100kHz  bandwidth.\nOverload Recovery\nLike many IC power regulators, the LT3080  has safe oper -\nating area (SOA) protection. The SOA protection decreases current limit as the input-to-output voltage increases and \nkeeps the power dissipation at safe levels for all values \nof input-to-output voltage. The LT3080  provides some \noutput current at all values of input-to-output voltage up \nto the device breakdown. See the Current Limit curve in \nthe Typical Performance Characteristics.\nWhen power is first turned on, the input voltage rises \nand the output follows the input, allowing the regulator \nto start into very heavy loads. During start-up, as the \ninput voltage is rising, the input-to-output voltage dif -\nferential is small, allowing the regulator to supply large \noutput currents. With a high input voltage, a problem can \noccur wherein removal of an output short will not allow \nthe output voltage to recover . Other regulators, such as \nthe LT1085  and LT1764 A, also exhibit this phenomenon \nso it is not unique to the LT3080 .\nThe problem occurs with a heavy output load when \nthe input voltage is high and the output voltage is low. \nCommon situations are immediately after the removal of \na short circuit. The load line for such a load may intersect \nthe output current curve at two points. If this happens, \nthere are two stable operating points for the regulator . \nWith this double intersection, the input power supply may \nneed to be cycled down to zero and brought up again to \nmake the output recover .\nLoad Regulation\nBecause the LT3080  is a floating device (there is no \nground pin on the part, all quiescent and drive current \nis delivered to the load), it is not possible to provide true \nremote load sensing. Load regulation will be limited by the \nFigure\xa07.

The data sheet specification for load regulation \nis Kelvin sensed at the pins of the package. Negative side \nsensing is a true Kelvin connection, with the bottom of \nthe voltage setting resistor returned to the negative side of \nthe load (see Figure\xa07 ). Connected as shown, system load \nregulation will be the sum of the LT3080  load regulation \nand the parasitic line resistance multiplied by the output \ncurrent. It is important to keep the positive connection \nbetween the regulator and load as short as possible and \nuse large wire or PC board traces.\nThermal Considerations\nThe LT3080  has internal power and thermal limiting cir -\ncuitry designed to protect it under overload conditions. \nFor continuous normal load conditions, maximum junc -\ntion temperature must not be exceeded. It is important \nto give consideration to all sources of thermal resistance \nfrom junction to ambient. This includes junction-to-case, \ncase-to-heat sink interface, heat sink resistance or circuit \nboard-to-ambient as the application dictates. Additional \nheat sources nearby must also be considered.\nFor surface mount devices, heat sinking is accomplished \nby using the heat spreading capabilities of the PC board \nand its copper traces. Surface mount heat sinks and \nplated through-holes can also be used to spread the heat \ngenerated by power devices.\nJunction-to-case thermal resistance is specified from the \nIC junction to the bottom of the case directly below the \ndie. This is the lowest resistance path for heat flow. Proper \nmounting is required to ensure the best possible thermal \nflow from this area of the package to the heat sinking \nmaterial. For the TO-220 package, thermal compound is \nstrongly recommended for mechanical connections to \na heat sink. A thermally conductive spacer can be used \nfor electrical isolation as long as the added contribution \nto thermal resistance is considered. Note that the Tab \nor Exposed Pad (depending on package) is electrically \nconnected to the output.\nThe following tables list thermal resistance for several \ndifferent copper areas given a fixed board size. All mea -\nsurements were taken in still air on two-sided 1/16 ” FR-4 \nboard with one ounce copper .APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3080\n15\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comThe power in the drive circuit equals :\n P DRIVE  = (VCONTROL  – VOUT)(ICONTROL )\nwhere I CONTROL  is equal to I OUT/60. I CONTROL  is a function \nof output current. A curve of I CONTROL  vs I OUT can be \nfound in the Typical Performance Characteristics curves.\nThe power in the output transistor equals :\n P OUTPUT  = (VIN – VOUT)(IOUT)\nThe total power equals :\n P TOTAL  = PDRIVE  + P OUTPUT\nThe current delivered to the SET pin is negligible and can \nbe ignored.\nVCONTROL(MAX CONTINUOUS)  = 3.630V  (3.3V + 10%)\nVIN(MAX CONTINUOUS)  = 1.575V  (1.5V + 5%)\nVOUT = 0.9V, IOUT = 1A, TA = 50°C\nPower dissipation under these conditions is equal to :\n PDRIVE = (VCONTROL  – VOUT)(ICONTROL )\n ICONTROL=IOUT\n60=1A\n60=17mA\n P DRIVE  = (3.630V  – 0.9V)(17mA ) = 46mW\n P OUTPUT  = (VIN – VOUT)(IOUT)\n P OUTPUT  = (1.575V  – 0.9V)(1A) = 675mW\n Total Power Dissipation = 721mWJunction Temperature will be equal to :\n T J = TA + P TOTAL  • qJA (approximated using tables)\n T J = 50°C + 721mW  • 64°C/W = 96°C\nIn this case, the junction temperature is below the maxi -\nmum rating, ensuring reliable operation. \nReducing Power Dissipation\nIn some applications it may be necessary to reduce the \npower dissipation in the LT3080  package without sacri -\nficing output current capability. T wo techniques are avail -\nable. The first technique, illustrated in Figure\xa08 , employs \na resistor in series with the regulator ’s input. The voltage \ndrop across R S decreases the LT3080 ’s IN-to-OUT dif -\nferential voltage and correspondingly decreases the \nLT3080 ’s power dissipation.\nAs an example, assume : VIN = VCONTROL  = 5V, VOUT = 3.3V \nand I OUT(MAX)  = 1A. Use the formulas from the Calculating \nJunction Temperature section previously discussed.\nWithout series resistor R S, power dissipation in the \nLT3080  equals :\n PTOTAL=5V–3.3V ( )•1A\n60⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+5V–3.3V ( )•1A\n=1.73W\nIf the voltage differential (V DIFF) across the NPN pass tran -\nsistor is chosen as 0.5V, then R S equals :\n RS=5V–3.3V−0.5V\n1A=1.2Ω\nPower dissipation in the LT3080  now equals :\n PTOTAL=5V–3.3V ( )•1A\n60⎛\n⎝⎜⎞\n⎠⎟+0.5V ( )•1A=0.53W\nThe LT3080 ’s power dissipation is now only 30% com -\npared to no series resistor . R S dissipates 1.2W  of power . \nChoose appropriate wattage resistors to handle and dis -\nsipate the power properly.\nFigure\xa08. Reducing Power Dissipation Using a Series Resistor+\n–L T3080 INVCONTROL\nOUTVOUTVINʹVIN\nC2\n3080 F08SET\nRSETRSC1APPLICATIONS INFORMATION\nLT3080\n16\nRev. D For more information www.analog.comThe second technique for reducing power dissipation, \nshown in Figure\xa09 , uses a resistor in parallel with the \nLT3080 . This resistor provides a parallel path for current \nflow, reducing the current flowing through the LT3080 . \nThis technique works well if input voltage is reasonably \nconstant and output load current changes are small. This \ntechnique also increases the maximum available output \ncurrent at the expense of minimum load requirements.\nAs an example, assume : VIN = VCONTROL  = 5V, VIN(MAX)  = \n5.5V, VOUT = 3.3V, VOUT(MIN)  = 3.2V, IOUT(MAX)  = 1A and \nIOUT(MIN)  = 0.7A. Also, assuming that R P carries no more \nthan 90% of I OUT(MIN)  = 630mA .\nCalculating R P yields :\n RP=5.5V–3.2V\n0.63A=3.65Ω\xa0\n \n (5% Standard value = 3.6Ω)The maximum total power dissipation is ( 5.5V – 3.2V) • \n1A = 2.3W. However the LT3080  supplies only :\n 1A–5.5V–3.2V\n3.6Ω=0.36A\nTherefore, the LT3080 ’s power dissipation is only :\n P DIS = (5.5V – 3.2V) • 0.36A  = 0.83W\nRP dissipates 1.47W  of power . As with the first technique, \nchoose appropriate wattage resistors to handle and dis -\nsipate the power properly. With this configuration, the \nLT3080  supplies only 0.36A . Therefore, load current can \nincrease by 0.64A  to 1.64A  while keeping the LT3080  in \nits normal operating range. \nFigure\xa09.

#### Description:
The LT3080 is a low dropout linear regulator designed to provide a high current output of 1.1A with an adjustable output voltage ranging from 0V to 36V. It features a unique architecture that allows it to function as a precision current source and voltage follower, making it suitable for applications requiring high current and minimal heat generation without the need for a heat sink. The device can be paralleled to increase output current or to spread heat across multiple devices on a surface-mounted board.

#### Typical Applications:
- **Power Management:** The LT3080 is ideal for applications that require a stable and adjustable power supply, such as powering digital ICs and other sensitive components.
- **Post Regulator for Switching Supplies:** It can be used as a post regulator to improve the output quality of switching power supplies.
- **Low Output Voltage Power Supplies:** The ability to adjust the output voltage down to zero makes it suitable for low voltage applications.
- **Automotive Applications:** With AEC-Q100 qualification, it is suitable for automotive power management systems.
- **High Efficiency Linear Regulation:** The LT3080 can be used in systems where efficiency is critical, especially when paired with a higher voltage supply for control and a lower voltage for the collector.

This component is particularly advantageous in designs where space is limited and thermal management is a concern, allowing for efficient operation in compact electronic systems.
