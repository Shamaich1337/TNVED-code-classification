This mode of operation \nreduces the number of control lines required and \nsimplifies the switch control interface typically \nderived from a CMOS μProcessor I/O port.  \n \nComplementary -pin control mode  allows the \nswitch to operate using complementary control \npins V1 and V2 (pins 2 & 1), that can be directly \ndriven by +3.3 or 5.0 -volt CMOS logic or a suitable \nμProcessor I/O port.

Evaluation Board Schematic  \nDOC -02389  PRT-53366 \nThe SPDT switch evaluation kit board was designed to \nease customer evaluation of the PE4251 SPDT switch. \nThe RF common port is connected through a 50 Ω \ntransmission line to the bottom SMA connector, J3. Port \n1 and Port 2 are connected through 50 Ω transmission \nlines to two SMA connectors on either side of the \nboard, J4 and J2. A through transmission line connects \nSMA connectors J5 and J6. This transmission line can \nbe used to estimate the loss of the PCB over the \nenvironmental conditions being evaluated.  \n \nThe board is constructed of a two metal layer FR4 \nmaterial with a total thickness of 0.0322”. The bottom \nlayer provides ground for the RF transmission lines. \nThe transmission lines were designed using a coplanar \nwaveguide with ground plane model using a trace width \nof 0.033”, trace gaps of 0.010”, dielectric thickness of \n0.028”, copper thickness of 0.0021” and εr of 4.3.  \n \nJ1 provides a means for controlling the DC inputs to the \ndevice. The second -to-bottom lower right pin (J1 –3) is \nconnected to the device V1 input. The second -to-top \nupper right pin (J1 –7) is connected to the device V2  \ninput. Footprints for decoupling capacitors are provided \non both V1 and V2 traces. It is the responsibility of the \ncustomer to determine proper supply decoupling for \ntheir design application. Removing these components \nfrom the evaluation board has not been shown to \ndegrade RF performance.  \nProduct Specification  \nPE4251  \nPage  6 of 10  ©2008–2019 pSemi Corp.
