It employs the progressive \ncompression technique over a cascaded amplifier chain, each stage of which is equipped with a detector cell. The device is used in measurement or controller mode. The AD8318 maintains  \naccurate log conformance for signals of 1 MHz to 6  GHz and \nprovides useful operation to 8  GHz. The input range is typically \n60 dB (re ferenced to  50 Ω) with error less than ±1  dB. T he \nAD8318 has a 10 ns response time that enables RF burst detection to beyond 45 MHz. The device provides unprecedented \nlogarithmic intercept stability vs. ambient temperature conditions. \nA 2 mV/°C slope temperature sens or output is also provided for \nadditional system monitoring. A single supply of 5  V is required.  \nCurrent consumption is typically 68 mA. Power consumption decreases to <1.5 mW when the device is disabled.  \nThe AD8318 can be configured to provide a control voltage  \nto a VGA, such as a power amplifier or a measurement output, from Pin  VOUT . Because the output can be used for controller \napplications, wideband noise is minimal.  \nIn this mode, the setpoint control voltage is applied to VSET . \nThe feedback loop thr ough an RF amplifier is closed via VOUT , \nthe output of which regulates the amplifier output to a magnitude  \ncorresponding to VSET. The AD8318 provides 0 V to 4.9 V \noutput capability at the VOUT  pin, suitable for controller \napplications. As a measurement dev ice, Pin VOUT  is externally \nconnected to VSET  to produce an output voltage, V\nOU T, which is a decreasing linear -in-dB function of the RF input signal \namplitude.  \nThe logarithmic slope is nominally −25 mV/dB but can be \nadjusted by scaling the feedback voltage  from VOUT to the \nVSET  interfac e. The intercept is 20 dBm (referenced to 50 Ω, \nCW input) using the INHI input. These parameters are very \nstable against supply and temperature variations.  \nThe AD8318 is fabricated on a SiGe bipolar IC process and is availab le in a 4 mm × 4 mm, 16 -lead LFCSP for the operating \ntemperature range of – 40\noC to +85oC. \n2.4\n0\n–65 10\n04853-052PIN (dBm)VOUT (V)\nERROR (dB)2.2\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.00.80.60.4\n0.26\n–65\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n–1\n–2\n–3\n–4\n–5\n–60–55–50–45–40–35–30–25–20–15–10 –5 05\n \nFigure 2.

D | Page 11 of 24 THEORY OF OPERATION \nThe AD8318 is a 9- stage demodulating logarithmic amplifier \nthat provides RF measurement and power amplifier control \nfunctions. The design of the AD8318 is similar to the AD8313 logarithmic detector/controller. However, the AD8318 input frequency range extends to 8 GHz with a 60 dB dynamic range.  \nOther improvements include: reduced intercept variability vs. temperature, increased dynamic range at higher frequencies, \nlow noise measurement and controller output ( VOUT ), \nadjustable low -pass corner frequency ( CLPF ), temperature \nsensor output ( TEMP ), ne gative transfer function slope for \nhigher accuracy, and 10 ns response time for RF burst detection \ncapability. A block diagram is shown in Figure 22. \nTEMP\nSENSORGAIN\nBIASSLOPE\nDET DET DET DET\nINHI\nINLOIV VOUTIV VSET\nCLPFTEMPVPSI ENBL TADJ VPSO\nCMOP CMIP\n04853-021 \nFigure 22. Block Diagram  \nA fully differential design, using a proprietary high speed SiGe \nprocess, extends high frequency performance. Input INHI \nreceives the signal with a low frequency  impedance of nominally  \n1200 Ω in parallel with 0.7 pF. The maxi mum input with ±1 dB \nlog confor mance error is typically 0 dBm (re ferenced to  50 Ω). \nThe noise spectral density referred to the input is 1.15 nV/ √Hz, \nwhich is equivalent to a voltage of 118 μV rms in a 10.5 GHz bandwidth, or a noise power of −66  dBm (re ferenced to  50 Ω). \nThis noise spectral density sets the lower limit of the dynamic \nrange. However, the low end accuracy of the AD8318 is enhanced  \nby specially shaping t he demodulating transfer charac teristic to \npartially compensate for errors due to intern al noise.  \n CMIP , the input system common pin, provides a quality low \nimpedance connection to the printed circuit board (PCB) \nground via four package pins. Ground the package paddle, which is internally connected to the CMIP  pin, to the PCB to \nreduce therm al impedance from the die to the PCB.  \nThe logarithmic function is approximated in a piecewise fashion by nine cascaded gain stages. For a more complete explanation of the logarithm approximation, refer to the AD8307 data sheet. The cells have a nominal voltage gain of \n8.7 dB each an d a 3 dB bandwidth of 10.5 GHz.  \nUsing precision biasing, the gain is stabilized over temperature and supply variations. Because the cascaded gain stages are dc-coupled, the overall dc gain is high. An offset compensation \nloop is included to correct for offsets within the cascaded cells. At the output of each of the gain stages, a square -law detector \ncell rectifies the signal. The RF signal voltages are converted to a fluctuating differe ntial current with an average value that \nincreases with signal level. Along with the nine gain stages and detector cells, an additional detector is included at the input of the AD8318, altogether providing a 60 dB dynamic range. After the detector currents  are su mmed and filtered, the function  \nI\nD × log10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) (1) \nis formed at the summing node,  \nwhere:  \nID is the internally set detector current.  \nVIN is the input signal voltage. \nVINTERCEPT  is the intercept voltage (that is, when VIN = VINTERCEPT , \nthe output voltage would be 0 V if capable of going to 0  V). \nAD8318  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 12 of 24 USING THE AD8318  \nBASIC CONNECTIONS  \nThe AD8318 is specified for operation up to 8 GHz. As a result, \nlow impedance supply pins with adequate isolation between \nfunctions are essential. In the AD8318, VPSI  and VPSO,  the two \npositive supply pins, must be connected to the same positive  \npotential. The VPSI  pin biases the input circuitry, while the \nVPSO  pin biases the low noise output driver for VOUT . \nSeparate commons are also included in the device. CMOP  is \nused as the common for the output drivers. Connect Pin CMIP \nand Pin CMOP to a low impedance ground pla ne. \nApply a  power supply voltage of between 4.5 V and 5.5 V to \nVPSO  and VPSI . In addition, 100 pF and 0.1 μF power supply \ndecoupling capacitors connect close to each power supply pin. \nThe two adjacent VPSI pins can share a pair of decoupling capacitors due  to their proximity.  \n04853-0221SEE TEMPERATURE COMPENSATION SECTION.\n2SEE RESPONSE TIME SECTION.12\nCMIP11\nCMIP10\nTADJ9\nVPSO\n1CMIP\n2CMIP\n3VPSI\n4VPSI13TEMP 8 CMOP\n14INHI 7 VSET\n15INLO 6 VOUT\n16ENBL 5 CLPFAD8318\nC7\n100pF\nC8\n0.1µF\nVSC1\n1nF\nC2\n1nF499Ω\nNOTE 1\nC6\n100pFC5\n0.1µFVS\nR1\n52.3ΩTEMP\nRF\nINPUT\nVSVOUT\nNOTE 2\n \nFigure 23. Basic Connections  \nThe paddle of the AD8318 LFCSP is internally connected to C M I P.  For optimum thermal and electrical performance, solder \nthe paddle to a low impedance ground plane.  \nENABLE INTERFACE  \nTo enable the AD8318, the ENBL pin must be pulled high. \nTaking ENBL low puts the AD8318 in sleep mode, reducing \ncurrent consumption to 260 µA at ambient. The voltage on ENBL must be greater than 2 V\nBE (~1.7 V) to enable the device. \nWhen enabled, the ENBL pin draws less than 1 µA. When ENBL is pulled low, the pin sources 15 µA. \nThe enable interface has high input impedance. An internal \n200 Ω resistor is placed in series with the ENBL input for added \nprotection. Figure 24 depicts a simplified schematic of the \nenable interface.

ENBL Response Time; VPOS = 5.0 V;  \nInput AC -Coupling Caps = 18 pF; CLPF = Open  \nINPUT SIGNAL COUPLIN G \nThe RF input to the AD8318 (INHI) is single end ed and must \nbe ac -coupled. INLO (input common) must  be ac -coupled to \nground (see Figure 23). Suggested coupling capacitors are 1  nF \nceramic, 0402- style capacitors for input frequencies of 1 MHz to \n8 GHz. The coupling capacitors must  be mounted close to the \nINHI pin and the INLO pin. These capacitor values can be increased to lower the input sta ge high- pass cutoff frequency. \nThe high- pass corner is set by the input coupling capacitors and \nthe internal 10 pF capacitor. The dc voltage on INHI and INLO  \nis approximately one diode voltage drop below the voltage applied to the VPSI pin . \nThe Smith Chart  in Figure 16 shows the AD8318 input \nimpedance vs. frequency. Table 4 lists the reflection coefficient \nand impedance at select frequencies. For Figure 16 and Table 4, \nthe 52.3 Ω input termination resistor is removed. At dc, the \nresistance is typically 2 kΩ. At frequencies up to 1  GHz, the \nimpedance is approximated as 1000 Ω||0.7 pF. The RF input \npins are coupled to a network as shown in the simplified \nschematic in Figure 26. \nData Sheet AD8318\n \nRev.

Using the typical value of 1 nF, this high-pass \ncorner is ~3.2 MHz. In high frequency applications, f HP must be \nas large as possible to minimize the coupling of unwanted low \nfrequency signals. Likewise, in low frequency applications, a simple RC network forming a low-pass filter must be added, generally placed at the generator side of the coupling capacitors, \nthereby lowering the required capacitance value for a given \nhigh-pass corner frequency. \nOUTPUT INTERFACE \nThe logarithmic output interface is shown in Figure 27. The \nVOUT pin is driven by a PNP output stage. An internal 10 Ω \nresistor is placed in series with the emitter follower output and the VOUT pin. The rise time of the output is limited mainly by the slew on CLPF. The fall time is an RC limited slew provided by the load capacitance and the pull-down resistance at VOUT. \nThere is an internal pull-down resistor of 350 Ω. Any resistive \nload at VOUT is placed in parallel with the internal pull-down \nresistor and provides additional discharge current. \n04853-025+\n0.2V\n150Ω\n200Ω–10Ω\nVOUTVPSO\nCLPF\nCMOP  \nFigure 27.

When a portion  \nof VOUT is applied to VSET, the feedback loop forces \n−ID × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) = I SET (2) \nIf VSET = V OUT/X, ISET = VOUT/(X × 3.13 kΩ).

The slope is set to −1 V/decade or \n−50 mV/dB. \nTEMPERATURE COMPENSA TION OF OUTPUT \nVOLTAGE \nThe AD8318 functionality includes the capability to externally trim the temperature drift. Attaching a ground-referenced \nresistor to the TADJ pin alters an internal current, minimizing \nintercept drift vs. temperature. As a result, the R\nTADJ can be \noptimized for operation at different frequencies. \n04853-0272kΩICOMP\n~0.4V\nTADJ2V\nVINTERNAL\n  \nFigure 29.

The V PTAT voltage is multiplied \nby a factor of 5, resulting in a 2 mV/°C output at the TEMP pin. \nThe output voltage at 27°C is typically 600 mV . An emitter \nfollower drives the TEMP pin, as shown in Figure 30. \n04853-0281kΩ4kΩ\nCMIPINTERNALVPSI\nTEMP\n \nFigure 30. TEMP Sensor Interface \nThe internal pull-down resistance is 5 kΩ. The temperature sensor has a slope of 2 mV/°C. \nThe temperature sensor output varies with output current due \nto increased die temperature. Output loads less than 1 kΩ draw enough current from the output stage causing this increase to occur. An output current of 10 mA results in the voltage on the \ntemperature sensor to increase by 1.5°C, or ~3 mV . \nBest precision from the temperature sensor is obtained when \nthe supply current to AD8318 remains fairly constant, that is, \nno heavy load drive. MEASUREMENT MODE \nWhen the VOUT voltage, or a portion of the VOUT voltage, is \nfed back to VSET, the device operates in measurement mode. \nAs shown in Figure 31, the AD8318 has an offset voltage, a negative slope, and a VOUT measurement intercept greater than its input signal range. \n2.4\n00.30.60.91.21.51.82.12.0\n1.51.00.50\n–0.5\n–1.0–1.5\n–65 –60 –55 –50 –45 –40 –35 –30 –25 –20 –15 –10 –5 0 15 105\n04853-029\nINTERCEPT\nERROR (dB)VOUT (V)\nPIN (dBm)VOUT 25°C\nERROR 25°C\nRANGE OF\nCALCULATION\nOF SLOPE AND\nINTERCEPT\n \nFigure 31. Typical Output Voltage vs. Input Signal \nThe output voltage vs. input signal voltage of the AD8318 is \nlinear-in-dB over a multidecade range. The equation for this \nfunction is \nVOUT = X × VSLOPE/DEC  × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) (3) \n= X × VSLOPE/dB  × 20 × log 10(VIN/VINTERCEPT ) (4) \nwhere: \nX is the feedback factor in  VSET = VOUT/X. \nVINTERCEPT  is expressed in V rms. \nVSLOPE/DEC  is nominally −500 mV/decade and VSLOPE/dB  is \nnominally −25 mV/dB.  \nVINTERCEPT , expressed in dBV , is the x-axis intercept of the linear-\nin-dB transfer function shown in Figure 31.  \nVINTERCEPT  is 7 dBV (20 dBm, referenced to 50 Ω or 2.239 V rms) \nfor a sinusoidal input signal. \nThe slope of the transfer function can be increased to \naccommodate various converter mV per dB (LSB per dB) requirements. However, increasing the slope can reduce the dynamic range. This is due to the limitation of the minimum and maximum output voltages, determined by the chosen scaling factor X. \nThe minimum value for V\nOUT is X × V OFFSET . The offset voltage, \nVOFFSET , is equal to 0.5 V and is internally added to the detector \noutput signal. \nVOUT(MIN)  = (X × VOFFSET ) (5) \nData Sheet  AD8318  \n \nRev. D | Page 15 of 24 The maximum output voltage is 2.1 V × X, and cannot exceed \n400 mV below the positive supply.  \nVOUT(MAX)  = (2.1 V × X ) when X  < (VPOS − 400 mV)/(2.1 V)  (6) \nVOUT(MAX)  = (VPOS − 400 mV) when X  ≥ (VPOS − 400 mV)/ (2.1 V) \n (7) \nWhen X = 1, the typical outpu t voltage swing is 0.5 V to 2.1 V . \nThe output voltage swing is modeled using E quation  5 to \nEquation 7  and restricted by Equation 8:  \nVOUT(MIN)  < VOUT < VOUT(MAX)  (8) \nWhen X = 4 and VPOS =  5  V,  \n(X × VOFFSET ) < VOUT < (VPOS − 400 mV)  \n(4 × 0.5 V) < VOUT < (2.1 V × 4)  \n2 V < VOUT < 4.6 V  \nFor X = 4, slope = −100 mV/dB; VOUT can swing 2.6 V , and the \nusable dynamic range is reduced to 26 dB from 0 dBm to –26 dBm.  \nThe slope is very stable vs. process and temperature variation. \nWhen base-10 logarithms are used, VSLOPE/DECADE  represents the \noutput voltage per decade of input power. One decade is equal to 20 dB; V\nSLOPE/DEC /20 = VSLOPE/dB  represents the output voltage \nslope in V/dB.  \nAs noted in Equation 3, the  VOUT voltage has a negative slope. \nThis is the correct s lope polarity to control the gain of many \npower amplifiers and other VGAs in a negative feedback configuration. Because both the slope and intercept vary \nslightly with frequency, refer to Table 1 for application -specific \nvalues for the slope and intercept.  \nAlthough demodulating log amps respond to input signal \nvoltage, not input signal power, it is customary to discuss the amplitude o f high frequency signals in terms of power. In this \ncase, the characteristic impedance of the system, Z\n0, must be \nknown to convert voltages to corresponding power levels. Beginning with the definitions of dBm and dBV ,  \nP (dBm) = 10 × log\n10(Vrms2/(Z0 × 1 mW))  (9) \nV (dBV) = 20 × log10(Vrms/1 Vrms) (10) \nWhen Equation 9 is expanded  \nP (dBm) = 20 × log10(Vrms) − 10 × log10(Z0 × 1 mW)  (11) \nand given Equation 10, Equation 11 can  be rewritten as  \nP (dBm) = V (dBV) − 10 × log10(Z0 × 1 mW)  (12) \nFor example, PINTERCEPT  for a sinusoidal input signal, expressed \nin terms of dBm (decibels referred to 1 mW), in a 50 Ω system is  \nPINTERCEPT  (dBm) = VINTERCEPT  (dBV)  \n − 10 × log10(Z0 × 1 mW) =  (13) \n7 dBV − 10 × log10(50 × 10−3) = 20 dBm  \nFor further information on the i ntercept variation dependence \nupon waveform, refer to the AD8313 and AD8307 data sheets.

Transfer Function at 2.2 GHz  \nBecause the slope and intercept vary from device to device, \nboard -level calibration is performed to achieve high accuracy.  \nThe equation can be rewritten for output voltage, from the Measurement Mode  section, using an intercept expressed  \nin dBm.  \nV\nOUT = Slope  × (PIN – Intercept ) (14) \nIn general, the calibration is performed by applying two known \nsignal levels to the AD8318 input and measuring the corre -\nsponding output voltages. The calibration points are generally \nchosen to be within the linear -in-dB operating range of the \ndevice (see Figur e 32). Calculation of the slope and intercept is \ndone by: \nSlope  = (VOUT1 − VOUT2)/(PIN1 − PIN2) (15) \nIntercept  = PIN1 − VOUT1/Slope  (16) \nOnce the slope and intercept are calculated, an equation can  be \nwritten to allow calculation of an (unknown) input power based \non the output voltage of the detector.  \nPIN(unknown) = VOUT (measured )/Slope  + Intercept  (17) \nAD8318  Data Sheet  \n \nRev. D | Page 16 of 24 Using the equation for the ideal output voltage (see Equation 13) as \na reference, the log conformance error of the measured data can \nbe calculated as  \nError (dB) = (VOUT (MEASURED)  − VOUT (IDEAL) )/Slope  (18) \nFigure 32 includes a plot of the error at 25°C, the temperature at \nwhich the log amp is calibrated. Note that the error is not zero. This is because the log amp does not perfectly follow the ideal V\nOUT vs. PIN equation, even within its operating region. The error  at \nthe calibra tion points ( −12 dBm and − 52 dBm, in this case) is, \nhowever, equal to 0 by definition.  \nFigure 32 includes error plots for the output voltage at − 40°C \nand +85°C. These error plots are calculated using the slope  \nand intercept at 25°C. This method is consistent with a mass -\nproduction environ ment where calibration at temperature is  \nnot practical.  \nSELECTING CALIBRATIO N POINTS TO IMPROVE \nACCURACY OVER A REDU CED RANGE  \nIn some applications, very high accuracy is required at just one \npower level or over a reduced input range. For example, in a \nwireless transmitter, the accuracy of the high po wer amplifier \n(HPA) is most critical at, or close to, full power.  \nFigure 33 shows the same measured data as Figure 32. Note  \nthat accuracy is very high from −10 dBm to − 30 dBm. Below \n−30 dBm, the error increases to about − 1 dB.

In \ngeneral, the calibration points are never chosen in the nonlinear \nportion of the transfer function  of the log amp (above − 5 dBm \nor below − 60 dBm, in this case).  Figure 34 shows how calibration points can be adjusted to \nincrease dynamic range but at the expense of linearity. In this case, the calibration points for slope and intercept are set at −4 dBm and − 60 dBm. These points are at the end of the linear \nrange of the device. =  \nOnce again, at 25°C, an error of 0 dB is seen at the calibration points. Note also that the range over which the AD8318 \nmaintains an error of < ±1 dB is extended to 60 dB at 25°C and \n58 d B over temperature. The disadvantage of this approach is \nthat linearity suffers, especially at the top end of the input range.  \n2.2\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.60.40.2\n–65 –60 –55\n–50 –45 –40 –35 –30 –25 –20 –15 –10 –5 0 5\n04853-038\nPIN (dBm)VOUT (V)2.5\n–2.5–2.0–1.5–1.0–0.500.51.01.52.0\nERROR (dB)VOUT +25°C\nVOUT –40°C\nVOUT +85°CERROR +25°C\nERROR –40°C\nERROR +85°C\n58dB DYNAMIC RANGE (±1dB ERROR)\n \nFigure 34. Dynamic Range Extension by Choosing Calibration Points  \n Close to the End of the Linear Rang e \nAnother way of presenting the error function of a log amp detector is shown in Figure 35. In this case, the dB error at hot \nand cold temperatures is calculated with respect to the output \nvoltage at ambient. This is a key difference in comparison to the \nplots in Figure 33 and Figure 34. Previously, all errors were \ncalculated with respect to the idea l transfer function at ambient.  \nWhen this alternative technique is used, the error at ambient becomes, by definition, equal to 0 (see Figure 35). This is valid \nif the device transfer function perfectly follows the ideal  \nV\nOUT = Slope  × (PIN − Intercept ) equation. However, because a \nlog amp in practi ce never perfectly follows this equation \n(especially outside of its linear operating range), this plot tends to artificially improve linearity and extend the dynamic range. \nThis plot is a useful tool for estimating temperature drift at a \nparticular power l evel with respect to the (nonideal) output \nvoltage  at ambient. However, to achieve this level of accuracy in \nan end application requires calibration at multiple points in the operating range of the device.  \nData Sheet  AD8318  \n \nRev.

Typical Drift at 5.8 GHz for Various Temperatures  \nSETTING THE OUTPUT S LOPE IN MEASUREMENT \nMODE  \nTo operate in measurement mode, VOUT is connected to VSET. This yields the typical logarithmic slope of −25  mV/dB. The \noutput swing corresponding to the specified input range is then approximately 0.5 V to 2.1 V . The slope and output swing can be \nincreased by placing a resistor divider between V OUT and \nVSET (that is, one resistor from VOUT to VSET and one  \nresistor from VSET to common).  \nAs an example, if two equal resistors, such as 10  kΩ/10  kΩ, are \nused, the slope doubles to approximately −50  mV/dB. The input \nimpedance of VSET is approximately 50 0 kΩ. Keep s lope setting \nresistors below ~50  kΩ to prevent this input impedance from \naffecting the resulting slope. When increasing the slope, the new output voltage range cannot exceed the output voltage \nswing capability of the output stage.

AD8318 Operating with the High Speed ADCMP563  Comparator \n \nRESPONSE TIME CAPABILITY \nThe AD8318 has a 10 ns rise/fall time capability (10% to 90%) \nfor input power switching between the noise floor and 0 dBm. \nThis capability enables RF burst measurements at repetition rates beyond 45 MHz. In most measurement applications, the \nAD8318 has an external capacitor connected to CLPF to provide \nadditional filtering for VOUT. However, using the CLPF capacitor slows the response time as does stray capacitance on VOUT. For an application requiring maximum RF burst detection capability, the CLPF pin is left unconnected. In this case, the integration function is provided by the 1.5 pF on-chip capacitor. \nThere is a 10 Ω internal resistor in series with the output driver. \nBecause of this resistor, it is necessary to add an external 40 Ω \nback-terminating resistor in series with the output when driving a 50 Ω load. Place the back-terminating resistor close to the VOUT pin. The AD8318 has the drive capability to drive a 50 Ω load at the end of a coaxial cable or transmission line when back terminated (see Figure 39). \nThe circuit diagram in Figure 39 shows the AD8318 used with a \nhigh speed comparator circuit. The 40 Ω series resistor at the \noutput of the AD8318 combines with an internal 10 Ω to \nproperly match to the 50 Ω input of the comparator. \n04853-041\n0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800\nTIME (ns)AD8318\nOUTPUT\nCOMPARATOROUTPUTPULSED RF\nINPUT–50dB –30dB –20dB –10dB\n \nFigure 40. Pulse Response of AD8318 and Comparator for RF Pulses \nof Varying Amplitudes Figure 40 shows the response of the AD8318 and the comparator \nfor a 500 MHz pulsed sine wave of varying amplitudes. The output level of the AD8318 is the signal strength of the input signal. For applications where these RF bursts are very small, \nthe output level does not change by a large amount. Using a \ncomparator is beneficial in this case because it turns the output of the log amp into a limiter-like signal. While this configuration does result in the loss of received signal power level, it does \nallow for presence-only detection of low power RF bursts.  \nOUTPUT FILTERING \nFor applications in which maximum video bandwidth and, \nconsequently, fast rise time are desired, it is essential that the CLPF pin be left unconnected and free of any stray capacitance. \nTo reduce the nominal output video bandwidth of 45 MHz, \nconnect a ground-referenced capacitor (C\nFLT) to the CLPF pin, \nas shown in Figure 41. Generally, this is done to reduce output \nripple (at twice the input frequency for a symmetric input \nwaveform, such as sinusoidal signals). \n04853-042+4ILOG\n3.13kΩVOUT\nCLPF\nCFLTAD8318\n1.5pF\n \nFigure 41.

D | Page 19 of 24 In many log amp applications, it may be necessary to lower the \ncorner frequency of the postdemodulation filtering to achieve \nlow output ripple while maintaining a rapid response time to changes in signal level. For an example of a 4 -pole active filter, \nsee the AD8307 data sheet.  \nCONTROLLER MODE  \nThe AD8318 provides a controller mode feature at the VOUT  \npin. Using VSET for the setpoint voltage, it is possible for the \nAD8318 to control subsystems, such as power amplifiers (PAs), variable gain amplifiers (VGAs), or variable voltage attenuators \n(VV As) that have output power that increases monotonically \nwith respect to thei r gain control signal. \nTo operate in controller mode, the link between VSET and VOUT is broken. A setpoint voltage is applied to the VSET input; VOUT is connected to the gain control terminal of the VGA, and the detector RF input is connected to the output of \nthe VGA (usually using a directional coupler and some \nadditional attenuation). Based on the defined relationship \nbetween V\nOUT and the RF input signal when the device is in \nmeasurement mode, the AD8318 adjusts the voltage on VOUT (VOUT is now an error a mplifier output) until the level at the \nRF input corresponds to the applied V\nSET. \nWhen the AD8318 operates in controller mode, there is no \ndefined relationship between VSET and VOUT voltage; VOUT settles \nto a value that results in the correct input signa l level appearing \nat INHI/INLO.  \nIn order for this output power control loop to be stable, a ground -referenced capacitor is connected to the CLPF pin.  \nThis capacitor, C\nFLT, integrates the error signal (in the form of a \ncurrent) to set the loop bandwidth and ensure loop stability. For \nfurther details on control loop dynamics, refer to the AD8315 \ndata sheet.  \n04853-034RFIN VGA/VVA\nGAIN\nCONTROL\nVOLTAGEDIRECTIONAL\nCOUPLER\nATTENUATOR\nINHI\nVSETINLO\nCLPFVOUT\nAD831852.3Ω1nF\nCFLT1nFDAC\n \nFigure 42. AD8318 Controller Mode \nDecreasing VSET, which corresponds to demanding a higher \nsignal from the VGA, tends to increase VOUT. The gain control \nvoltage of the VGA must have a positive sense. A positive \ncontrol voltage to the VGA increases the gain of the device.  The basic connections for operating the AD8318 as an analog \ncontr oller with the AD8367 are shown in Figure 43. The \nAD8367 is a low frequency to 500 MHz VGA with 45 dB of \ndynamic range. This configuration is very similar to the one \nshown in Figure 42. For applications working at high input \nfrequencies, such as cellular bands or WLAN, or those requiring large gain control ranges, the AD8318 can control  \nthe 10 MHz to 3 GHz ADL5330 RF VGA. For further details \nand an application schematic, refer to the ADL5330 data sheet.  \nThe voltage applied to the GAIN pin controls the gain of the AD8367. This  voltage, V\nGAIN, is scaled linear -in-dB with a slope \nof 20  mV/dB and runs from 50 mV at −2.5 dB of gain up to \n1.0 V at +42.5 dB.  \nThe incoming RF signal to the AD8367 has a varying amplitude \nlevel. Receiving and demodulating it with the lowest possible error requires that the signal levels be optimized for the highest \nsignal- to-noise ratio (SNR) feeding into the analog -to-digital \nconverters (ADC). This is done by using an automatic gain \ncontrol (AGC) loop. In Figure 43, the voltage output of the \nAD8318 modifies the gain of the AD8367 until the incoming \nRF signal produces an output v oltage that is equal to the \nsetpoint voltage V\nSET. \n04853-047+3V\nINPT VOUTVPOS GND\nGAINAD8367\nVGA\nHPFLRF INPUT SIGNAL RF OUTPUT SIGNAL\n+5V\nVSET\nCLPFINHIVPOS\nGNDAD8318VOUT\nINLOR1\n1kΩ\n1nF\n1nF0.1µF\nCFLT\n100pF100MHz\nBANDPASS\nFILTER174Ω\nR2\n261ΩRHP\n100ΩCHP\n100pF\nDAC+VSET\nSETPOINT\nVOLTAGE57.6Ω\n \nFigure 43. AD8318 Operating in Controller Mode to Provide Automatic Gain \nControl Functionality in Combination with the AD8367  \nThe AGC loop is capable of controlling signals over ~45 dB dynamic range. The output of the AD8367 is designed to drive \nloads ≥ 200 Ω. As a result, it is not necessary to use the 53.6 Ω resistor at the input of the AD8318; the nominal input imped -\nance of 2 kΩ is sufficient.  \nIf the  AD8367 output drives a 50 Ω load, such as an oscilloscope  \nor spectrum analyzer, use a simple resistive divider  network. \nThe divider used in Figure 43 has an insertion loss of 11.5 dB. \nFigure 44 shows the transfer function of output power vs. V\nSET \nvoltage for a 100 MHz sine wave at −40 dBm into the AD8367.  \nAD8318 Data Sheet\n \nRev.

Figure 45 \nshows an oscilloscope screen image of the AGC loop depicted in Figure 43. A 50 MHz sine wave with 50% AM modulation is applied to the AD8367.

Setpoint Voltage vs. Input Power. Optimal  \nsignal levels must be used to achieve the full 45 dB  \ndynamic range capabilities of the AD8367. \nIn some cases, if V GAIN is >1.0 V it can take an unusually long \ntime for the AGC loop to recover; that is, the output of the \nAD8318 remains at an abnormally high value and the gain is set to its maximum level. A voltage divider is placed between the output of the AD8318 and the AD8367 GAIN pin to ensure that \nV\nGAIN does not exceed 1.0 V . \nIn Figure 43, C HP and R HP are configured to reduce oscillation \nand distortion due to harmonics at higher gain settings. Some \nadditional filtering is recommended between the output of the \nAD8367 and the input of the AD8318. This helps to decrease the output noise of the AD8367, which can reduce the dynamic \nrange of the loop at higher gain settings (smaller V\nSET). \nResponse time and the amount of signal integration are controlled by C\nFLT. This functionality is analogous to the feedback capacitor \naround an integrating amplifier. Though it is possible to use \nlarge capacitors for C FLT, in most applications, values under 1 nF \nprovide sufficient filtering. \nCalibration in controller mode is similar to the method used in \nmeasurement mode. Do a simple 2-point calibration by applying two known V\nSET voltages or DAC codes and measuring the \noutput power from the VGA.

D | Page 21 of 24 CHARACTERIZATION SETUP AND METHODS \nThe general hardware configuration used for the AD8318 \ncharacterization is shown in Figure 47. The primary setup used \nfor characterization is measurement mode. The characterization board is similar to the customer evaluation board with the \nexception that the RF input has a Rosenberger SMA connector \nand R10 has changed to a 1 kΩ resistor to remove cable capacitance from the bench characterization setup. Slope and intercept are calculated in this data sheet and in the production environment using linear regression from −50 dBm to −10 dBm. The slope and intercept generate an ideal line. Log conformance \nerror is the difference from the ideal line and the measured \noutput voltage for a given temperature in dB. For additional information on the error calculation, refer to the Device \nCalibration and Error Calculation section. \nThe hardware configuration for pulse response measurement \nreplaces the 0 Ω series resistor at the VOUT pin with a 40 Ω \nresistor; the CLPF pin remains open. Pulse response time is \nmeasured using a Tektronix TDS5104 digital phosphor \noscilloscope. Both channels on the scope are configured for 50 Ω termination. The 10 Ω internal series resistance at VOUT, combined with the 40 Ω resistor, attenuates the output voltage level by two. RF input frequency is set to 100 MHz with \n−10 dBm at the input of the device. The RF burst is generated \nusing a Rohde & Schwarz SMT06 with the pulse option with a period of 1.5 μs, a width of 0.1 μs, and a pulse delay of 0.04 μs. The output response is triggered using the video output from \nthe SMT06.  Refer to Figure 47 for an overview of the test setup. To measure noise spectral density, the 0 Ω resistor in series with \nthe VOUT pin is replaced with a 1 μF dc blocking capacitor. The capacitor is used because the Rohde & Schwarz FSEA spectrum analyzer cannot handle dc voltages at its RF input. \nThe CLPF pin is left open for data collected for Figure 19. For \nFigure 20, a 1 μF capacitor is placed between CLPF and ground. The large capacitor filters the noise from the detector stages  of the log amp. Noise spectral density measurements are taken using the FSEA spectrum analyzer and the SMT06 signal \ngenerator. The signal generator frequency is set to 2.2 GHz.  \nThe spectrum analyzer has a span of 10 Hz, resolution bandwidth of 50 Hz, video bandwidth of 50 Hz, and averages the signal 100×. Data is adjusted to account for the dc blocking \ncapacitor impedance on the output at lower frequencies. \n \n \n04853-046VIDEO\nOUTRF OUT\n–7dBmROHDE & SCHWARZ\nSMT06 TEKTRONIX\nTDS5104\nCH1* CH3* TRIGGER\nVOUT\nGND5V\nAD8318VPOS\nVSETINHI\nINLO40Ω\n52.3Ω1nF\n1nF*50Ω\nTERMINATION3dB\nSPLITTER\n \nFigure 47.
