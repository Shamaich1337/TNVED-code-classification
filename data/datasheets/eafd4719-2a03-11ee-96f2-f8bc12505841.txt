The mixer utilizes two standard Hittite \ndouble balanced mixer cells and a 90 degree hybrid fabricated in a GaAs \nsch\nottky diode process. A low \nfrequency quadrature hybrid was used to produce a 100\nmHz L sB iF ou\ntput. This product is a much \nsmaller alternative to hybrid style ima\nge rej\nect mix\ners \nand si\nngle si\ndeband Upconverter assemblies. The \nHmc10\n56LP4B e e\nliminates the need for wire bonding \nand allows the use of surface mount manufacturing techniques. \nElectrical Specifications, TA = +25°C, IF = 100 MHz,  LSB, LO = +10 dBm [1]\nParameter min .

### Component Summary: HMC1056LP4BETR

**Description:**
The HMC1056LP4BETR is a GaAs MMIC (Monolithic Microwave Integrated Circuit) I/Q mixer designed for operation in the frequency range of 8 to 12 GHz. It can function as either an image reject mixer or a single sideband upconverter. The device is compact and comes in a leadless, "Pb-free" surface mount package, making it suitable for high-density applications.

**Key Specifications:**
- **Voltage Ratings:** Not explicitly stated; typically, MMICs operate at low voltages.
- **Current Ratings:** Not specified; however, the device must not source/sink more than 3mA on the IF pins.
- **Power Consumption:** Maximum continuous power dissipation is 800 mW (derated at 8.9 mW/°C above 85°C).
- **Operating Temperature Range:** -40°C to +85°C.
- **Package Type:** 20 Lead 4x4 mm SMT (Surface Mount Technology) package.
- **Special Features:**
  - Wide IF bandwidth: DC to 4 GHz.
  - High image rejection: 25 dBc.
  - High input IP3: 18 dBm.
  - Low conversion loss: 8 to 11 dB.
- **Moisture Sensitive Level (MSL):** MSL 1, indicating it is not moisture sensitive and can withstand standard soldering processes.

**Typical Applications:**
The HMC1056LP4BETR is ideal for various applications, including:
- Point-to-point and point-to-multipoint radio communications.
- Military radar systems, electronic warfare (EW), and electronic intelligence (ELINT).
- Satellite communications.
- Sensor applications.

This mixer is particularly useful in systems requiring high performance in terms of isolation, image rejection, and conversion gain, making it suitable for advanced communication systems and radar applications.
