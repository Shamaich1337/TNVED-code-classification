The HI-8684incorporates the digital logic and analog line receivercircuitry in a single device.\nThe HI-8683 is also available as a second source to the\nDLS-112 18 pin DIP and 28 pin PLCCpackage pinouts.\nThe receivers on the HI-8684 connect directly to the ARINC\n429 Bus and translate the incoming signals to normal CMOSlevels. Internal comparator levels are set just below thestandard 6.5 volt minimum data threshold and just above thestandard 2.5 volt maximum null threshold. The -10 version\nof the HI-8684 allows the incorporation of an external 10K\nresistance in series with each ARINC input for lightning\nprotection without affectingARINC level detection.\nBoth products offer high speed 8-bit parallel bus interface, a\n32-bit buffer, and error detection for word length and parity.Areset pin is also provided for power-on initialization.with the original\n/c87\n/c33\n/c33Automatic conversion of serial ARINC 429, 575 &\n561 data to 8-bit parallel data\nHigh speed parallel 8-bit data busError detection - and\nOn-chip line receiver option (HI-8684)\nInput hysteresis of at least 2 volts (HI-8684)\nTest inputs bypass analog inputs (HI-8684)\nSimplified lightning protection with the ability to add\n10 Kohm external series resistors (HI-8684-10)\nPlastic package options - surface mount (SOIC),\nPLCC and DIP\nIndustrial and extended temperature ranges/c33\n/c33/c33/c33/c33/c33\n/c33/c33word length parity\nReset input for power-on initializationFEATURESPIN CONFIGURATIONS (Top View)October 2008\nDATARDY\nD7D6D5D4D3D2D1D0\nHI-8684PSI\nHI-8684PST\n&\nHI-8684PSI-10\nHI-8684PST-101\n23456789\n10\n(See page 8 for additional pin configurations)1234567891\n2345678918\n171615141312\n11\n10\n20\n1918171615141312\n11\nHI-8683\n18-Pin Plastic SOIC - WB Package\nHI-8684\n20-Pin Plastic SOIC - WB PackageHI-8683PSI\nHI-8683PSTVcc\nGAPCLK\nINB\nINAERRORPARITY ENB\nGNDRESET\nREAD\nGAPCLK\nTESTATESTB\nRINB (-10)\nRINA(-10)ERRORPARITY ENB\nGNDRESET\nREADVcc\nDATARDY\nD7D6D5D4D3D2D1D0\n(DS8683 Rev.

The incoming data stream is serially shifted into an inputregister, checked for errors, and then transferred in parallel toa 32-bit receive buffer. The receive data can be accessed us-ing four 8-bit parallel read operations while the next serialdata steam is being received.\nFigure 1 is a block diagram of both the HI-8683 and HI-8684.\nThe difference between the two products is the HI-8684 hasa built-in line receiver whereas the HI-8683 is strictly a digitaldevice and requires an external ARINC line receiver such asthe Holt HI-8444, HI-8445, HI-8448 , HI-8482 or HI-8588 to in-terface to theARINC 429 bus.RECEIVER INPUTS HI-8684 Line Receiver\nInternal 35K resistors are in series with both the RINA and\nRINB ARINC 429 inputs. They connect to level translators\nwhose resistance to GND is typically 10K After level trans-\nlation, the buffered inputs drive a differential amplifier. The\ndifferential signal is compared to levels derived from a dividerbetween VCC and GND. The nominal settings correspond toa One/Zero amplitude of 6.0V and a Null amplitude of 3.3V. Avalid ARINC One/Zero input sets a latch and a Null input re-sets the latch.\nSince any added external series resistance will affect the volt-\nage translation, the HI-8684-10 is available with 25K of the\n35K series resistance required for proper ARINC 429 leveldetection. The remaining 10K required that must be addedcan be incorporated in other external circuitry such as light-\nning protection. Except for the different input series resis-tance, the HI-8684 and HI-8684-10 are identical./c87\n/c87\n/c87\n/c87\n/c87/c46\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n2\nPROTOCOL DETECTION\nARINC clock and data in the HI-8683 are derived from the\ntwo streams of digital data at the INAand INB inputs and theresulting One/Zero data is shifted into a 32-bit input registeras illustrated in Figure 3.\nIn the HI-8684, the One/Zero data shifted into the input reg-\nister is created from either the two digital outputs of the built-in line receiver (Figure 3) or the TESTA and TESTB inputs(Figure 4).\nFor ARINC 561 operation, the INA and INB data streams in-\nputs must be derived from the ARINC 561 data, clock andsync with external logic.GAP DETECTION\nThe end of a data word is detected by an internal counter\nthat times out when a data One or Zero is not received for aperiod equal to 16 cycles of the GAPCLK signal. The gapdetection time may vary between 16 and 17 cycles of theGAPCLK signal since the incoming data and GAPCLK arenot usually synchronous inputs. The required frequency ofGAPCLK is a function of the mininum gap time specified forthe type of ARINC data being received. Table 1 indicatestypical frequencies that may be used for the various datarates normally encountered.Figure 1.

If there is a parityerror, the 32nd bit of the received data word is set high.\nIf parity checking is disabled (PARITY ENB low) the 32nd\nbit of the data word is always the 32ndARINC bit received.\nThe ERROR flag output is set high upon receipt of a word\ngap and the number of bits received since the previousword gap is less than or greater than 32. The ERROR flagis reset low when the next valid ARINC word is written intothe receive buffer or when is pulsed low.\nWhen the data word is transferred to the receive buffer, the\nDATA RDY pin goes high. The data word can then be readin four 8-bit bytes by pulsing the input low as indi-cated in Figure 5. The first read cycle resets DATA RDYlow and increments an internal counter to the next 8-bitbyte. The counter continues to increment on each read cy-cle until all four bytes are read. The relationship betweeneach bit of anARINC word received and each bit of the four8-bit data bus bytes is specified in Figure 2.\nWhen a new ARINC word is received it always overwrites\nthe receive buffer. If the first byte of the previous word hasnot been read, then previous data is lost and the receivebuffer will contain the new ARINC word. However, if theDATA RDY pin goes high between the reading of the firstand fourth bytes, the previous read bytes are no longervalid because the unread bytes have been overwritten bythe new ARINC word. Also, the next read will be of the firstbyte of the newARINC word since the internal byte counteris always reset to the first byte when new data is trans-ferred to the receive buffer.RESET\nREADFUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTION (cont.)\n-1.50 to +1.50V -1.50V to +1.50V 0 0 0 0\n-3.25V to -6.50V +3.25V to +6.50V 0 0 0 1\n+3.25V to +6.50V -3.25V to -6.50V 0 0 1 0\nX X 0 101X X 1 010\nX X 1 100\nX = don\'t careRINA RINB TESTA TESTB RXA RXB\nTRUTH TABLE 1Read Byte Data Bus Bits ARINC Bits\n1st Byte 1 D0 - D7 ARINC 1 - ARINC 8\n2nd Byte 2 D0 - D7 ARINC 9 - ARINC 16\n3rd Byte 3 D0 - D7 ARINC 17 - ARINC 24\n4th Byte 4 D0 - D7 ARINC 25 - ARINC 32\nFIGURE 2.

When goes high, the internallogic remains in the initialized state until the first word gap isdetected preventing reception of a partial word.\nThe built-in differential line receiver on the HI-8684 can be\ndisabled allowing the data and clock detection circuitry tobe driven directly with digital signals. The logical OR func-tion of the TESTA and TESTB is defined in Truth Table 1.The two inputs can be used for testing the receiver logic andfor inputting ARINC 429 type data derived from anothersource / protocol.

Oth-erwise, an ERROR condition may occur and the first 32bits of data on the test inputs may not be properly re-ceived.\nAlso, when entering the test mode, both TESTA and\nTESTB should be set high and held in that state for atleast one word gap period (17 gap clocks) aftergoes high.\nWhen exiting the test mode, both test inputs should be held\nlow and the device initialized withRESET\nRESET\nRESET\nRESET\nRESET.\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n4\nHI-8683, HI-8684\nTESTA+5V\n0V\nTESTB0V+5V\nDERIVED CLOCKDERIVED DATADERIVED CLOCKARINC Data Bits Word Gap\n28 29 30 31 32 1 2 4 Bit Periods Min.\nINA (HI-8683 only)\nINB (HI-8683 only)\nVDIFF\nRINA - RINB\n(HI-8684 only)\nDERIVED DATA0V0V\n+5V\n0V\n+10V+5V\n-10VTIMING DIAGRAMS\nFIGUR E 3 - RECEIVER INPUT TIMING FOR ARINC 429\nFIGUR E 5 - RECEIVER PARALLEL DATABUS TIMINGDATA RDY\nREAD\nD 0-D 7 VALIDtRDYCLR\ntRDPW\ntRR\ntFD tRD\nVALID VALID VALID1st 8-bits 2nd 8-bits 3rd 8-bits 4th 8-bitstDRDYDERIVED DATA32nd\nARINC BitFIGUR E 4 - TEST INPUT TIMING FOR ARINC 429ARINC Data Bits Word Gap\n28 29 30 31 32 1 2 4 Bit Periods Min.\nHOLT INTEGRATED CIRCUITS\n5\nSupply Voltages\nV ...................................................+5V\nTemperature Range\nIndustrial ................................ -40°C to +85°CHi-Temp ............................... -55°C to +125°C\nJunction Temperature, Tj ................... +175°CCC ±5 %\n/c163\nPARAMETERS SYMBOL TEST CONDITIONS MIN TYP MAX UNITS\nARINC Bus Inputs\nDigital Inputs(RINA & RINB, HI-8684 only)\nDifferential input voltage\none or zero V differential voltage 6.5 10.0 13.0 voltsnull V " " " " - - 2.75 voltscommon mode V with respect to GND - - 5.0 volts\nInput resistance\nRINA (-10) to RINB (-10) R supplies floating 30 75 - KohmRINA (-10) or RINB (-10) to GND or V R " " " \' 19 40 - Kohm\nInput capacitance (Guaranteed but not tested)\ndifferential C RINA to RINB - - 20 pFto GND C - - 20 pFto V C - - 20 pF\n(INA, INB, , GAPCLK, & PARITY ENB)\nInput voltage\nhigh V 2.0 - V voltslow V 0.0 - 0.8 volts\nInput current\nsource I V = 5.0V - - 1.0 µAsink I V = 0.0V -1.0 - - µA\nInput capacitance C - - 8.0 pFDIN\nNIN\nCOM\nDIFF\nCC SUP\nDIFF\nG\nCC H\nIH CC\nIL\nIH IN\nIL IN\nIRESET READAll voltages referenced to GND\nSupply voltages\nV ....................................................... +7.0V\nVoltage on inputs\nRINA (-10) to RINB (-10) ......... +29V to - 29VAll other input pins..................-0.3 to Vcc +0.3\nDC current per input pin ....................... +10mAPower dissipation at 25°C\nplastic 18-pin SO..... 1.9W, derate 15.4mW/°Cplastic 18-pin DIP.....1.6plastic 20-pin SO......1.4plastic 20-pin PLCC .2.0\nSolder Temperature\nLeads ................................ +280°C for 10 secPackage body .....................................+220°C\nStorage Temperature ............. -65°C to +150°CCC\nW, derate 13.3mW/°C\nW, derate 11.5mW/°C\nW, derate 17.2mW/°CNOTE: Stresses above absolute maximum\nratings or outside recommended operatingconditions may cause permanent damage tothe device.
