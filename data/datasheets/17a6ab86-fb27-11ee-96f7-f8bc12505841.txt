Priority  is defined  \nby pin assignment , with V1 assigned  the highest  priority  \nand V3 the lowest  priority . A power  supply  is defined  as \nvalid when  its voltage  has been within  its overvoltage  (OV) \nand undervoltage  (UV) window  continuously  for at least \n256ms. If the highest  priority  valid input  falls out of the \nOV/UV window , the channel  is immediately  disconnected  \nand the next highest  priority  valid input  is connected  to the \ncommon  output . Tw o or more  LTC4417 s can be cascaded  \nto provide  switchover  between  more  than three  inputs .\nThe LTC4417  incorporates  fast non-overlap  switching  \ncircuitry  to prevent  both reverse  and cross  conduction  \nwhile  minimizing  output  droop . The gate driver  includes  \na 6V clamp  to protect  external  MOSFETs . A controlled  \noutput  ramp  feature  minimizes  start-up inrush  current . \nOpen  drain  VALID  outputs  indicate  the input  supplies  have \nbeen within  their OV/UV window  for 256ms.\nAll registered  trademarks  and trademarks  are the property  of their respective  owners . \nPriority  Switching  from 12V V1 to 14.8 V V2APPLICATIONSn Selects  Highest  Priority  Supply  from Three  Inputs\nn Blocks  Reverse  and Cross  Conduction  Currents\nn Wide  Operating  Voltage  Range : 2.5V to 36V\nn –42 V Protection  Against  Reverse  Battery  \nConnection\nn Fast Switchover  Minimizes  Output  Voltage  Droop\nn Low 28µA Operating  Current\nn <1µ A Current  Draw  from Supplies  Less than VOUT\nn 1.5% Input  Overvoltage /Undervoltage  Protection\nn Adjustable  Overvoltage /Undervoltage  Hysteresis\nn P-Channel  MOSFET  Gate Protection  Clamp\nn Cascadable  for Additional  Input  Supplies\nn 24-Lead Narrow  SSOP  and 4mm × 4mm QFN \nPackages\nn Industrial  Handheld  Instruments\nn High Availability  Systems\nn Battery  Backup  Systems\nn Servers  and Computer  Peripherals\nIRF7324\nIRF7324\nIRF7324\nVS1 V1\nVOUT\nVALID1\nVALID2\nVALID3V1: 12V \nWALL ADAPTER2A\nOUTPUT\nV2: 14.8V Li-Ion\nMAIN/SWAPPABLE\nV3: 12V SLA\nBACKUP\nUV1\nOV1806k\n1M 1M 1M\n39.2k\n60.4k\nV2\nUV2\nOV21.05M\n31.6k\n68.1k\nV3 EN\nSHDN\nHYS\nCASUV3\nOV3\n4417 TA01a698k\n16.9k\n49.9kG1 VS2 VS3 G2\nGNDL TC4417G3\nV2\nV1\nV3 = 0V , I L = 2A\nCL = 120µF\n50ms/DIV4417 TA01b2V/DIVVOUT\nV1 UV FAUL T14.8V\n12V14.8V\n\nLTC4417\n2\nRev.

G For more information www.analog.comOPERATION\nThe Functional  Block  Diagram  displays  the main  functional  \nblocks  of this device . The LTC4417  connects  one of three  \npower  supplies  to a common  output , VOUT, based  on user \ndefined  priority . Connection  is made  by enhancing  external  \nback-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs . Unlike  a diode -OR, \nwhich  always  passes  the highest  supply  voltage  to the \noutput , the LTC4417  lets one use a lower  voltage  supply  \nfor primary  power  and a higher  voltage  supply  as second -\nary or backup  power .\nDuring  normal  operation  the LTC4417  continuously  moni -\ntors V1, V2 and V3 through  its respective  OV1, OV2 and OV3 \nand UV1, UV2 and UV3 pins using  precision  overvoltage  \nand undervoltage  comparators . The highest  priority  input  \nsupply  whose  voltage  is within  its respective  OV/UV window  \nfor at least 256ms is considered  valid and is connected  to \nVOUT through  external  back-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs . \nVALID 1, VALID 2 and VALID 3 pull low to indicate  when  the \nV1, V2 and V3 input  supplies  are valid.\nHysteresis  on the OV and UV threshold  is adjustable . \nConnecting  a resistor , RHYS, between  HYS and ground  \nforces  63mV/RHYS current  to flow out of OV1, OV2 and \nOV3 and into UV1, UV2 and UV3 to create  hysteresis  when  \noutside  their respective  OV/UV windows . Connecting  HYS \nto ground  sets the OV and UV comparator  hysteresis  to \n30mV. See the Application  Information  for more  details .\nDuring  channel  transitions , monitoring  circuitry  prevents  \ncross  conduction  between  input  channels  and reverse  con-\nduction  from VOUT using  a break -before -make  architecture . \nThe VGS comparator  monitors  the disconnecting  channel ’s \ngate pin voltage  (G1, G2 or G3). When  the gate voltage  is \n350mV from its common  source  connection  (VS1, VS2 or \nVS3), the VGS comparator  latches  the output  to indicate  \nthe channel  is off and allows  the next valid priority  input  \nsupply  to connect  to VOUT, preventing  cross  conduction  \nbetween  channels . The latch is reset  when  the channel  is \nturned  on.\nTo prevent  reverse  conduction  from VOUT to V1, V2 and V3 \nduring  channel  switchover , the REV comparator  monitors  \nthe connecting  input  supply  (V1, V2 or V3) and output  \nvoltage  (VOUT). The REV comparator  delays  the connection  \nuntil the output  voltage  droops  lower  than the input  voltage  by the reverse  current  blocking  threshold  of 120mV. The \noutput  of the REV comparator  is latched , resetting  when  \nits respective  channel  is turned  off.\nThe LTC4417  gate driver  pulls down  on G1, G2 and \nG3 with a strong  P-channel  source  follower  and a 2µA \ncurrent  source . When  the clamp  voltage  is reached , the \nP-channel  source  follower  is back biased , leaving  the \n2µA current  source  to hold G1, G2 and G3 at the clamp  \nvoltage . To minimize  inrush  current  at start-up, the gate \ndriver  soft-starts  the first input  supply  to connect  VOUT, \nat a rate of around  5V/ms terminating  when  any channel  \ndisconnects  or 32ms has elapsed . Once  slew rate control  \nhas terminated , the gate driver  quickly  turns  on and off \nexternal  back-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs  as needed . A \nSHDN  low to high transition  or VOUT drooping  below  0.7V \nreactivates  soft-start.\nWhen  EN is driven  above  1.1V the highest  valid priority  \ninput  supply  is connected  to VOUT. The high voltage  EN \ncomparator  disconnects  all channels  when  EN is driven  \nbelow  1.1V. The LTC4417  continues  to monitor  the OV \nand UV pins and reflects  the current  input  supply  status  \nwith VALID 1, VALID 2 and VALID 3. When  four or more  \nsupplies  need to be prioritized , connect  the higher  prior-\nity LTC4417 ’s CAS to the lower  priority  LTC4417 ’s EN. If \nVOUT is allowed  to fall below  0.7V, the next connecting  \ninput  supply  is soft-started .\nThe high voltage  SHDN  comparator  forces  the LTC4417  into \na low current  state when  SHDN  is forced  below  0.8V. While  \nin the low current  state, all channels  are disconnected , OV \nand UV comparators  are disabled , and all 256ms timers  \nare reset . When  SHDN  transitions  from low to high, the \nfirst validated  input  to connect  to VOUT is soft-started .\nTw o separate  internal  power  rails ensure  the LTC4417  is \nfunctional  when  one or more  input  supply  is present  and \nabove  2.3V. VBESTGEN  generates  a VBLDO rail from the \nhighest  V1, V2 and V3 and VOUT voltage . VBLDO powers  \nthe UVLO , bandgap , and VOUT comparator . The internal  \nVLDO powers  all other  circuits  from VOUT provided  VOUT is \ngreater  than 2.4V. If VOUT is less than 2.3V, VLDO powers  \nall other  circuits  from the highest  priority  supply  available . \nIf all sources  are invalid  or the LTC4417  is shut down , \nVLDO connects  to VBLDO.\nLTC4417\n11\nRev. G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS  INFORMATION\nINTRODUCTION\nThe LTC4417  is an intelligent  high voltage  triple  load switch  \nwhich  automatically  connects  one of three  input  supplies  \nto a common  output  based  on predefined  pin priorities  \nand validity . V1 is defined  to be the highest  priority  and \nV3 the lowest  priority , regardless  of voltage . An input  \nsupply  is defined  valid when  the voltage  remains  in the \nuser defined  overvoltage  (OV) and undervoltage  (UV) \nwindow  for at least 256ms.\nIf a connected  input  supply  falls out of the user defined  \nOV/UV window  and remains  outside  the OV/UV window  \nfor at least 8µs, the channel  is disconnected  and the next highest  valid priority  is connected  to the common  output . \nIf a lower  priority  input  supply  is connected  to VOUT and a \nhigher  priority  input  supply  becomes  valid, the LTC4417  \ndisconnects  the lower  priority  supply  and connects  the \nhigher  priority  input  supply  to VOUT.\nTypical  LTC4417  applications  are systems  where  predict -\nable autonomous  load control  of multiple  input  supplies  is \ndesired . These  supplies  may not necessarily  be different  \nin voltage , nor must  the highest  voltage  be the primary  \nsupply . A typical  LTC4417  application  circuit  is shown  in \nFigure  1.

OV and UV Thresholds  and Hysteresis  VoltageDEFINING  OPERATIONAL  RANGE\nTo guard  against  noise  and transient  voltage  events  during  \nlive insertion , the LTC4417  requires  an input  supply  remain  \nin the OV/UV window  for at least 256ms to be valid. The \nOV/UV window  for each input  supply  is set by a resistive  \ndivider  (for example , R1, R2 and R3 for V1 input  supply ) \nconnected  from the input  supply  to GND, as shown  in \nFigure  1. When  setting  the resistive  divider  values  for the \nOV and UV input  supply  threshold , take into consideration  \nthe tolerance  of the input  supply , 1.5% error  in the OV \nand UV comparators , tolerance  of R1, R2 and R3, and the \n±20nA maximum  OV/UV pin leakage  currents .\nIn addition  to tolerance  considerations , hysteresis  reduces  \nthe valid input  supply  operating  range . Input  supplies  will \nneed to be within  the reduced  input  supply  operating  range  \nto validate . Referring  to Figure  2, V1 supply  voltage  must  \nbe greater  than UVHYS to exit the UV fault. If an OV fault \noccurs , the V1 supply  voltage  must  return  to a voltage  \nlower  than the OVHYS voltage  to exit the OV fault.\nREDUCED\nOPERATING\nWINDOWOV/UV\nWINDOWOV\nUV\nV1\n4417 F02UV1 FAUL T\nOV1 FAUL T\nV1 VALIDOVHYS\nUVHYS\nHysteresis  for the OV and UV comparators  are set via the \nHYS pin. Two options  are available . Connecting  a resistor , \nRHYS, between  HYS and GND, as shown  in Figure  3, sets \nthe hysteresis  current  IOV_UV(HYS) that is sunk into UV1, \nUV2 and UV3 and sourced  out of OV1, OV2 and OV3. The \nvalue  of RHYS is calculated  with Equation  (1). Choose  RHYS \nto limit the hysteresis  current  to between  50nA and 500nA.\n  RHYS=63mV\nIOVUV(HYS) (1)\nwhere  50nA ≤ IOVUV (HYS) ≤ 500 nAFigure 3. LTC4417  External  Hysteresis\nIndependent  OV and UV hysteresis  values  are available  \nby separating  the single  string  resistive  dividers  R1, R2 \nand R3, shown  in Figure \xa03, into two resistive  strings , R4-\nR5 and R6-R7. In such a configuration , the top resistor  \ndefines  the amount  of hysteresis  and the bottom  resistor  \ndefines  the threshold .

G For more information www.analog.comAPPLICATIONS  INFORMATION\nReduction  of the valid operating  range  can be used to \nprevent  disconnected  high impedance  input  supplies  \nfrom reconnecting . For example , if 3 series  connected  AA \nAlkaline  batteries  with a total series  resistance  of 675mΩ \nis used to source  500mA, the voltage  drop due to the se-\nries resistance  would  be 337.5 mV. Once  the batteries  are \ndischarged  and are disconnected  due to a UV fault, the AA \nbattery  stack  would  recover  the 337.5 mV drop across  the \ninternal  series  resistance . Using  the 30mV fixed internal  \nhysteresis  allows  only 81mV of hysteresis  at the input  \npin, possibly  allowing  the input  supply  to revalidate  and \nreconnect . Using  external  hysteresis , the hysteresis  volt-\nage can be increased  to 400mV, reducing  or eliminating  \nthe reconnection  issue , as shown  in Figure  4.FIL TERING  NOISE  ON OV AND UV PINS\nThe LTC4417  provides  an 8µs OV/UV fault filter time. If \nthe 8µs filter time is not sufficient , add a filter capacitor  \nbetween  the OV or UV pin and GND to extend  the fault \nfilter time and ride through  transient  events .

When  selecting  the external  N-channel  MOSFET , \nbe sure to account  for drain  leakage  current  when  setting  \nUV and OV thresholds  by adjusting  the resistive  divider  to \nconsume  more  current .\nSELECTING  EXTERNAL  P-CHANNEL  MOSFETS\nThe LTC4417  drives  external  back-to-back P-channel  \nMOSFETs  to conduct  or block  load current  between  an \ninput  supply  and load. When  selecting  external  P-channel  \nMOSFETs , the key parameters  to consider  are on-resistance  \n(RDS(ON)), absolute  maximum  rated  drain  to source  break -\ndown  voltage  (BVDSS(MAX)), threshold  voltage  (VGS(TH)), \npower  dissipation , and safe operating  area (SOA).\nTo determine  the required  RDS(ON) use Equation  (8), where  \nVDROP is the maximum  desired  voltage  drop across  the \ntwo series  MOSFETs  at full load current , IL(MAX), for the \napplication . External  P-channel  MOSFET  devices  may be \nparalleled  to further  decrease  resistance  and decrease  \npower  dissipation  of each paralleled  MOSFET .\n  RDS(ON)≤VDROP\n2•IL(MAX) (8)\nThe clamped  gate drive  output  is 4.5V (minimum ) from \nthe common  source  connection . Select  logic level or lower  \nthreshold  external  MOSFETs  to ensure  adequate  overdrive . \nFor applications  with input  supplies  lower  than the clamp  \nvoltage , choose  external  MOSFET  with thresholds  suf-\nficiently  lower  than the input  supply  voltage  to guarantee  \nfull enhancement .\nIt is imperative  that external  P-channel  MOSFET  devices  \nnever  exceed  their BVDSS(MAX) rating  in the application . \nSelect  devices  with BVDSS(MAX) ratings  higher  than seen \nin the application . Switching  inductive  supply  inputs  with \nlow value  input  and/or output  capacitances  may require  \nadditional  precautions ; see T ransient  Supply  Protection  \nsection  in this data sheet  for more  information .In normal  operation , the external  P-channel  MOSFET  de-\nvices  are either  fully on, dissipating  relatively  low power , \nor off, dissipating  no power . However , during  slew-rate \ncontrolled  start-up, significant  power  is dissipated  in the \nexternal  P-channel  MOSFETs . The external  P-channel  \nMOSFETs  dissipate  the maximum  amount  of power  during  \nthe initial  slew-rate limited  turn on, where  the full input  \nvoltage  is applied  across  the MOSFET  while  it sources  \ncurrent . Power  dissipation  immediately  starts  to decrease  \nas the output  voltage  rises, decreasing  the voltage  drop \nacross  the MOSFETs .\nA conservative  approach  for determining  if a particular  \ndevice  is capable  of supporting  soft-start, is to ensure  its \nmaximum  instantaneous  power , at the start of the output  \nslewing , is within  the manufacturer ’s SOA curve . First \ndetermine  the duration  of soft-start using  Equation  (9) \nand find the inrush  current  into the load capacitor  using  \nEquation  (10).\n  tSTARTUP=VIN\n5V/ms [ ] (9)\n IMAXCAP  = CL • 5000[ V/s] (10)\nUsing  VIN and IMAXCAP , the power  dissipated  by the external  \nMOSFETs  during  start-up, PSS, is defined  by Equation \xa0 (11). \nIf the LTC4417  soft-starts  with a live IL, the extra  load cur-\nrent needs  to be added  to IMAXCAP , and PSS is calculated  \nby Equation  (12).\n PSS = VIN • IMAXCAP  (11)\n PSS = VIN • (IMAXCAP  + IL) (12)\nCheck  to ensure  PSS with a tSTARTUP  single  pulse  duration  \nlies within  the safe operating  area (SOA) of the chosen  \nMOSFET .

The large  reverse  voltage  rating  protects  36V input  \nsupplies  and downstream  devices  connected  to VOUT \nagainst  high reverse  voltage  connections  of –42V (absolute  \nmaximum ) with margin .\nSelect  back-to-back P-channel  MOSFETS  with BVDSS(MAX) \nratings  capable  of handling  any anticipated  reverse  voltages  \nbetween  VOUT and V1, V2 or V3. Ensure  transient  voltage  \nsuppressors  (TVS) connected  to reverse  connection  pro-\ntected  inputs  (V1, V2 and V3) are bidirectional  and input  \ncapacitors  are rated  for the negative  voltage .\nREVERSE  CURRENT  BLOCKING\nWhen  switching  channels  from higher  voltages  to lower  \nvoltages , the REV comparator  verifies  the VOUT voltage  is \nbelow  the connecting  channel ’s voltage  by 120mV before  \nthe new channel  is allowed  to connect  to VOUT. This ensures  \nlittle to no reverse  conduction  occurs  during  switching .\nAn example  is shown  in Figure  7. V2 is initially  connected  \nto VOUT when  a higher  priority  input  supply , V1, is inserted . The LTC4417  validates  V1 and disconnects  V2, allowing  \nVOUT to decay  from 18V to 11.88 V at a slew rate determined  \nby the load current  divided  by the load capacitance . Once  \nVOUT falls to 11.88 V, the LTC4417  connects  V1 to VOUT.\nSELECTING  VOUT CAPACITANCE\nTo ensure  there  is minimal  droop  at the output , select  a \nlow ESR capacitor  large  enough  to ride through  the dead \ntime between  channel  switchover . A low ESR bulk capacitor  \nwill reduce  IR drops  to the output  voltage  while  the load \ncurrent  is sourced  from the capacitor .

Once  soft-start \nhas terminated , the gate driver  quickly  turns  on and off \nexternal  back-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs  as needed . A \nSHDN  low to high transition  or VOUT drooping  below  0.7V \nreactivates  soft-start.\nINRUSH  CURRENT  AND INPUT  VOL TAGE  DROOP\nWhen  switching  control  of VOUT from a lower  voltage  supply  \nto a higher  voltage  supply , the higher  voltage  supply  may \nexperience  significant  voltage  droop  due to high inrush  \ncurrent  during  a fast connection  to a lower  voltage  output  \nbulk capacitor  with low ESR. This high inrush  current  may \nbe sufficient  to trigger  an undesirable  UV Fault.\nTo prevent  a UV fault when  connecting  a higher  voltage  \ninput  to a lower  voltage  output , without  adding  any inrush  \ncurrent  limiting , size the input  bypass  capacitor  large  \nenough  to provide  the required  inrush  current , as shown  \nby Equation  (15).\n  CV1≥CL•V1–VOUT(INIT)\nV1DROOP–1\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6\n\uf8f8\uf8f7\n (15)\nwhere  VOUT(INIT) is the initial  output  voltage  when  being  \npowered  from a supply  voltage  less than V1, CV1 is the \nbypass  capacitor  connected  to V1, CL is the output  capaci -\ntor and V1DROOP  is the maximum  allowed  voltage  droop  \non V1. Make  sure CV1 is a low ESR capacitor  to minimize  \nthe voltage  step across  the ESR.\nIn situations  where  input  and output  capacitances  can-\nnot be chosen  to set the desired  maximum  input  voltage  \ndroop , or the peak inrush  current  violates  the maximum  \nPulsed  Drain  Current  (IDM) of the external  P-channel  MOS -\nFETs, inrush  current  can be limited  by slew rate limiting  \nthe output  voltage . The gate driver  can be configured  to \nslew rate limit the output  with a resistor , capacitor  and \nSchottky  diode , as shown  in Figure  8. The series  resistor  \nRS and capacitor , CS, slew rate limit the output , while  the \nSchottky  diode , DS, provides  a fast turn off path when  G1 \nis pulled  to VS1.\nWith a desired  input  voltage  drop, V1DROOP , and known  \nsupply  resistance  RSRC, the series  resistance , RS, can \nbe calculated  with Equation  (16), where  ∆VG(SINK ) is \nthe LTC4417 ’s sink clamp  voltage , VGS is the external  GATE  DRIVER\nWhen  turning  a channel  on, the LTC4417  pulls the common  \ngate connection  (G1, G2 and G3) down  with a P-channel  \nsource  follower  and a 2µA current  source . VS1, VS2 and \nVS3 voltages  at or above  5V will produce  rising  slew rates  \nof 12V/µs and falling  slew rates  of 4V/µs with 10nF between  \nthe VS and G pins. VS1, VS2 and VS3 voltages  lower  than \n5V will result  in lower  slew rates , see typical  curves  for \nmore  detail . As G1, G2 and G3 approaches  the 6.2V clamp  \nvoltage , the source  follower  smoothly  reduces  its current  \nwhile  the 2µA hold current  continues  to pull G1, G2 and \nG3 to the final clamp  voltage , back biasing  the source  \nfollower . Clamping  the G1, G2 and G3 voltage  prevents  \nany overvoltage  stress  on the gate to source  oxide  of the \nexternal  back-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs . If leakage  into \nG1, G2 and G3 exceeds  the 2µA hold current , the G1, G2 \nand G3 voltage  will rise above  the clamp  voltage , where  \nthe source  follower  enhances  to sink the excess  current . \nWhen  turning  a channel  off, the gate driver  pulls the com-\nmon gate to the common  source  with a switch  having  an \non-resistance  of 22Ω, to effect  a quick  turn-off.\nTo minimize  inrush  current  at start-up, the gate driver  soft-\nstarts  the gate drive  of the first input  to connect  to VOUT. \nThe gate pin is regulated  to create  a constant  5V/ms rise \nrate on VOUT.

Depending  on the size \nof CRSS, RS may be large . Care should  be used to ensure  \ngate leakages  do not inadvertently  turn off the channel  over \ntemperature . This is particularly  true of built in Zener  gate-\nsource  protected  devices . Careful  bench  characterization  \nis strongly  recommended , as CRSS is non-linear .\nThe preceding  analysis  assumes  a small  input  inductance  \nbetween  the input  supply  voltage  and the drain  of the ex-\nternal  P-channel  MOSFET . If the input  inductance  is large , \nchoose  CV1 to be much  greater  than CL and replace  RSRC \nwith the ESR of CV1.\nWhen  slew rate limiting  the output , ensure  power  dis-\nsipation  does not exceed  the manufacturer ’s SOA for the \nchosen  external  P-channel  MOSFET . Refer  to the Selecting  \nExternal  P-channel  MOSFETs  section .TRANSIENT  SUPPL Y  PROTECTION\nThe LTC4417 ’s abrupt  switching  due to OV or UV faults  \ncan create  large transient  overvoltage  events  with inductive  \ninput  supplies , such as supplies  connected  by a long cable . \nAt times  the transient  overvoltage  condition  can exceed  \ntwice  the nominal  voltage . Such  events  can damage  external  \ndevices  and the LTC4417 . It is imperative  that external  \nback-to-back P-channel  MOSFET  devices  do not exceed  \ntheir single  pulse  avalanche  energy  specification  (EAS) in \nunclamped  inductive  applications  and input  voltages  to the \nLTC4417  never  exceed  the Absolute  Maximum  Ratings .\nTo minimize  inductive  voltage  spikes , use wider  and/or \nheavier  trace  plating . Adding  a snubber  circuit  will dampen  \ninput  voltage  spikes  as discussed  in Linear  Application  \nNote 88, and a transient  surge  suppressor  at the input  will \nclamp  the voltage . T ransient  voltage  suppressors  (TVS) \nshould  be placed  on any input  supply  pin, V1, V2 and V3, \nwhere  input  shorts , or reverse  voltage  connection  can be \nmade . If short -circuit  of input  sources  powering  VOUT are \npossible , transient  voltage  suppressors  should  also be \nplaced  on VOUT, as shown  in Figure  9.\nWhen  selecting  transient  voltage  suppressors , ensure  the \nreverse  standoff  voltage  (VR) is equal  to or greater  than \nthe application  operating  voltage , the peak pulse  current  \n(IPP) is higher  than the peak transient  voltage  divided  by \nthe source  impedance , the maximum  clamping  voltage  \n(VCLAMP ) at the rated  IPP is less than the absolute  maxi-\nmum  ratings  of the LTC4417  and BVDSS of all the external  \nback-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs .\nIn applications  below  20V, transient  voltage  suppressors  \nmay not be required  if the voltage  spikes  are lower  than the \nBVDSS of the external  P-channel  MOSFETs  and the LTC4417  \nFigure  9.

If the BVDSS of the external  \nP-channel  MOSFET  is momentarily  exceeded , ensure  the \navalanche  energy  absorbed  by the MOSFETs  do not exceed  \nthe single  pulse  avalanche  energy  specification  (EAS). \nVoltage  spikes  can be dampened  further  with a snubber .\nINPUT  SUPPL Y  AND VOUT SHORTS\nInput  shorts  can cause  high current  slew rates . Coupled  \nwith series  parasitic  inductances  in the input  and output  \npaths , potentially  destructive  transients  may appear  at the \ninput  and output  pins. If the short  occurs  on an input  that \nis not powering  VOUT, the impact  to the system  is benign . \nBack-to-back P-channel  MOSFETs  with their common  gates  \nconnected  to their common  sources  naturally  prevent  any \ncurrent  flow regardless  of the applied  voltages  on either  \nside of the drain  connections , as long as the BVDSS is not \nexceeded .\nIf the short  occurs  on an input  that is powering  VOUT, the \nissue  is compounded  by high conduction  current  and low \nimpedance  connection  to the output  via the back-to-back \nP-channel  MOSFETs . Once  the LTC4417  blocks  the high \ninput  short  current , V1, V2 and V3 may experience  large  \nnegative  voltage  spikes  while  the output  may experience  \nlarge  positive  voltage  spikes .\nTo prevent  damage  to the LTC4417  and associated  de-\nvices  in the event  of an input  or output  short , it may be \nnecessary  to protect  the input  pins and output  pins as \nshown  in Figure  9.

If the UV threshold  is high enough  and the short  \nresistive  enough , the LTC4417  will disconnect  the input . \nThe fast change  in current  may force  the output  below  \nGND, while  the input  will increase  in voltage .\nIf UV thresholds  are set close  to the minimum  operating  \nvoltage  of the LTC4417 , it may not disconnect  the input  Figure  10.

The event  would  cause  \nthe LTC4417 ’s internal  VLDO supply  voltage  to collapse . A \n100Ω and 10nF R-C filter on VOUT will allow  the LTC4417  \nto ride through  such shorts  to the input  and output , as \nshown  in Figure \xa010. Because  VOUT is also a sense  pin \nfor the REV comparator , care should  be taken  to ensure  \nthe voltage  drop across  the resistor  is low enough  to not \naffect  the reverse  comparator ’s threshold . If the 1µs R-C \ntime constant  does not address  the issue , increase  the \ncapacitance  to lengthen  the time constant .\nThe initial  lag due to the R-C filter on the LTC4417 ’s VOUT \nsense  and supply  pin will cause  additional  delay  in sensing  \nwhen  a reverse  condition  has cleared , resulting  in addi-\ntional  droop  when  transitioning  from a higher  voltage  to \na lower  voltage . If the reverse  voltage  duration  is longer  \nthan the R-C delay , the voltage  differential  between  the \noutput  and the filtered  VOUT, ∆V, can be calculated  with \nEquation  (18).

The highest  priority  source  is VOUT, which  powers  \nthe VLDO when  VOUT is above  2.4V. If VOUT is lower  than \n2.4V, VLDO switches  to the highest  valid priority  input  \nsupply , V1, V2 and V3.

Driving  EN above  \n1.1V enables  the highest  valid priority  channel . This feature  \nis essential  in cascading  applications . For applications  \nwhere  EN could  be driven  below  ground , limit the current  \nfrom EN with a 10k resistor .\nForcing  SHDN  below  0.8V turns  off all external  back-to-back \nP-channel  MOSFETs , disables  all OV and UV comparators  \nand resets  all 256ms timers . VALID 1, VALID 2 and VALID 3 \nrelease  high to indicate  all inputs  are invalid , regardless  \nof the input  supply  condition . The LTC4417  enters  into a \nlow current  state, consuming  only 15µA. When  SHDN  is \nreleased  or driven  above  0.8V, the LTC4417  is required  \nto revalidate  the input  supplies  before  connecting  the \ninputs  to VOUT, as described  in the Operation  section . For \napplications  where  SHDN  could  be driven  below  ground , \nlimit the current  from SHDN  with a 10k resistor .\nCASCADING\nThe LTC4417  can be cascaded  to prioritize  four or more  \ninput  supplies . To prioritize  four to six supplies , use two \nLTC4417 s with their VOUT pins connected  together  and the \nmaster  LTC4417 ’s CAS connected  to the slave  LTC4417 ’s \nEN as shown  in Figure  12. The first LTC4417  to validate  an \ninput  will soft-start the common  output . Once  the output  \nis above  2.4V, power  will be drawn  from VOUT by the other  \nLTC4417  regardless  of its input  supply  conditions .\nWhen  the master  LTC4417  wants  to connect  one of its \ninput  supplies  to the VOUT, it simultaneously  initiates  a \nchannel  turn on and pulls its CAS pin low to force  the slave  \nLTC4417  to disconnect  its channels . A small  amount  of \nreverse  conduction  may occur  in this case. The amount  \nof cross  conduction  will depend  on the total turn-on delay  \nof the master  channel  compared  with the turn-off delay  \nof the slave  channel . Care should  be taken  to ensure  the \nconnection  between  CAS and EN is as short  as possible , \nto minimize  the capacitance  and hence  the turn-off delay  \nof the slave  channel .\nWhen  all of the inputs  to the master  LTC4417  are invalid , \nthe master  confirms  that all its inputs  are disconnected  from VOUT before  releasing  CAS. CAS is pulled  to the in-\nternal  VLDO rail with a 30µA current  source , allowing  the \nslave  LTC4417  to connect  its highest  valid priority  channel  \nto VOUT. Confirmation  that all channels  are off before  the \nslave  is allowed  to connect  its channel  to VOUT prevents  \ncross  conduction  from occurring .\nDriving  the master  LTC4417 ’s EN low forces  both master  \nand slave  to disconnect  all channels  from the common  \noutput  and continue  monitoring  the input  supplies . Driv-\ning the master  LTC4417 ’s SHDN  low places  it in to a low \ncurrent  state.

Reviewing  several  \nMOSFET  options , the low 18mΩ RDS(ON), dual P-channel  \nIRF7324 with a –20V BVDSS, is chosen  for this application .\nThe low 18mΩ RDS(ON) results  in a 72mV combined  drop \nat 25°C and 85mV drop at 85°C. Each P-channel  MOSFET  \ndissipates  72mW at 25°C and 85mW at 85°C.\nInrush  Current  Limiting\nWhen  connecting  a higher  voltage  source  to a lower  voltage  \noutput , significant  inrush  current  can occur . The magnitude  \nof the inrush  current  can be calculated  with Equation  (19).  \n  IINRUSH=V1–VOUT(INIT)\nRSRC+ESR(CL)+2•RDS(ON) (19)\nwhere  VOUT(INIT) is the VOUT voltage  when  initially  powered  \nfrom a supply  voltage  less than V1, V1 is the higher  voltage  source , RSRC is source  resistance  of V1, ESR(CL) is the \nESR of the load capacitor , and RDS(ON) is the on-resistance  \nof the external  back-to-back MOSFET .\nGiven  a total series  resistance  from input  to output , the \nworst  case inrush  current  will occur  when  V1 is running  \n20% high, at 14.4 V, and VOUT is at its undervoltage  limit \nof 5.6V. During  this condition , a maximum  inrush  current  \nof 83A will occur , as shown  in Equation  (20).\n  IINRUSH=14.4V–5.6V\n20mΩ+50mΩ+36mΩ=83A\n (20)\nBecause  the 83A of inrush  current  exceeds  the 71A ab-\nsolute  maximum  pulsed  drain  current  rating , IDM, of the \nIRF7324, inrush  current  limiting  is required .\nCalculating  the load capacitance , CL, and inrush  current  \nlimiting  circuitry  component , RS, is an iterative  process . \nTo start, use Equation  (14), with 0.79 • RS • CS initially  set \nto 10µs. To limit the output  voltage  droop  to the desired  \n800mV, reserve  200mV for initial  droop  due to the load \ncurrent  flowing  in the ESR of the output  capacitor . Next, \nchoose  CL to set the maximum  VOUT droop  to 600mV, as \nshown  in Equation  (21).\n   CL=2A•(3.2µs + 12µs + 10µs)\n600mV\nCL=84µF  (21)\nFor margin , choose  the initial  CL value  equal  to 100µ F and \nuse Equation  (16) to determine  RS. With an allowable  1V \ninput  voltage  drop and source  resistance , RSRC, of 20mΩ, \nthe input  voltage  droop  of 700mV is used to set the inrush  \ncurrent  of 35A. The other  terms  in the equation  come  \nfrom the external  P-channel  MOSFET  manufacturer ’s data \nsheet . The transfer  characteristics  curve  shows  the gate \nvoltage , VGS, is approximately  1.8V when  driving  the 35A \ninrush  current  and the capacitance  verses  drain -to-source  \nvoltage  curve  shows  the maximum  CRSS is approximately  \n600pF. CS is set to be greater  than ten times  CRSS, or \n6.8nF. To ensure  the designed  inrush  current  is lower  \nthan the absolute  maximum  pulse  drain  current  rating , \nIDM, calculate  RS using  the maximum  value  for ∆VG(SINK ) \nand CL, and the minimum  value  for CS.

Although  1.8V is a \ntypical  value  for VGS, there  is sufficient  margin  – even if \nVGS = 0V, the resulting  IDM is lower  than the 71A rating . With RS and CS known , the desired  load capacitance  with \ninrush  current  limiting  is checked  with Equation \xa0(14) \nas shown  in Equation  (23). Because  the required  load \ncapacitance  of 90µF is lower  than the chosen  load ca-\npacitor  of 100µ F, the initial  choice  of 100µ F is suitable .\n  CL≥2A•(3µs+12µs+0.79 •2.21kΩ•6.8nF)\n600mV\nCL≥90µF\n (23)VS1\nV1 VOUT\nVALID1\nVALID2\nVALID312V SUPPL Y\nCIN\n2700µF\n7.4V Li-Ion\nBATTERY\n(2 × 3.7V)\nUV1\nOV1R3\n806k\nR2\n41.2k\nR1\n60.4k\nR6\n768k\nR5\n53.6k\nR4\n113k\nR9\n768k\nR8\n53.6k\nR7\n113kR10\n1MR11\n1MR12\n1M\nV2 INVALID\nV3 INVALIDV1 INVALID\nRHYS\n255k\n1%V2\nUV2\nOV2\nV3 EN\nSHDN\nHYS\nCASUV3\nOV3\n4417 F13G1 VS2 VS3 G2CVS3\n0.1µF\nGNDL TC4417G3IRF7324\nM5 M6IRF7324\nM3 M4IRF7324\nM1 M2\nCVS2\n0.1µFCVS1\n68nF\nCV1\n0.1µFCV2\n0.1µFCV3\n0.1µF+\nCL\n100µF\nVOUT++\n7.4V Li-Ion\nBATTERY\n(2 × 3.7V)\n+RS\n2.21kDS\nBAT54CS\n6.8nF\n140k\n140k\nLTC4417\n23\nRev.

The SOA of the P-channel  MOSFET  should  be \nchecked  to make  sure their SOA is not violated .\nWorst  case slew rate limited  channel  transition  time \nwould  occur  when  the lithium -ion batteries  are running  \nlow at 5.6V, and the supply  connects  while  running  20% \nhigh, at 14.4 V. This results  in a time of 25µs, as shown  \nin Equation  (24).\n  dt=(14.4V–5.6V)•100µF\n35A\ndt=25µs\n (24)\nThe IRF7324 thermal  response  curve  at 25µs shows  ZθJA \nto be approximately  0.18 for a single  pulse . The ZθJA of \n0.18 results  in a maximum  transient  power  dissipation  of \n694W at 25°C and 361W at 85°C. The external  P-channel  \nMOSFETs  will dissipate  no more  than 8.8V • 37A = 325 W \nduring  this period , below  the available  361W at 85°C.\nThe initial  soft-start period  will also force  the external  \nback-to-back MOSFETs  to dissipate  significant  power . To \ncheck  the SOA during  this period , start with Equation  (9).\n  tSTARTUP(ms)=12V\n5[V/ms]\ntSTARTUP(ms)=2.4ms\n (25)\nIMAXCAP  current  of 500mA is calculated  using  Equation  (10).\n IMAXCAP  = 100µ F • 5[V/ms]\n IMAXCAP  = 500 mA (26)\nThe worst  case soft-start power  dissipation  from Equa -\ntion (11) is:\n PSS(W) = 12 V • 500 mA\n PSS(W) = 6W (27)\nThe soft-start power  dissipation  of 6W is well below  the \ncalculated  transient  power  dissipation  (PDM) of 79.4 W at \na TC of 25°C. An ambient  temperature , TA, of 85°C results  \nin a PDM of 41.3 W, indicating  it is sufficient  to handle  the \n2.4ms transient  6W power  dissipation . A graphical  check  \nwith the manufacturer ’s SOA curves  confirms  sufficient  \noperating  margin .Setting  Operational  Range\nAssuming  the 12V source  has a tolerance  of ±20%, the \ninput  source  has an operational  undervoltage  limit of \n9.6V and an overvoltage  limit of 14.4 V. Ideally  the UV1, \nUV2 and UV3 and OV1, OV2 and OV3 thresholds  would  \nbe set to these  limits . However , since  the actual  threshold  \nvaries  by 1.5% and resistor  tolerances  are 1%, OV and \nUV limits  must  be adjusted  to ±26% or 8.9V and 15.1 V. \nFurther , instead  of using  the internal  fixed 30mV, a UV \nhysteresis  of 200mV is set using  an external  hysteresis  \ncurrent  of 250nA.\nThe design  process  starts  with setting  RHYS using   \nEquation  (1).\n  RHYS=63mV\n250nA=252kΩ\n (28)\nThe nearest  standard  value  is 255kΩ.\nNow set the UV hysteresis  value  using  R3\n  R3=Desired Hysteresis\nIOVUV(HYS)=200mV\n247nA=810kΩ\n (29)\nThe nearest  standard  value  is 806kΩ.\nWith R3 set, the remaining  resistance  can be determined  \nwith\n  R1,2=R3\nUVTH(FALLING)–VOVUV(THR)\n=806kΩ\n8.9V–1V=102kΩ\n (30)\nR1 is\n  R1=R1,2+R3\nOVTH(RISING)=102kΩ+806kΩ\n15.1V=60.1kΩ\n (31)\nThe nearest  1% standard  value  is: 60.4 kΩ.\nR2 is\n R2 = R1,2 – R1 = 102 kΩ – 60.4 kΩ = 41.6 kΩ (32)\nThe nearest  1% standard  value  is 41.2 kΩ.\nLTC4417\n24\nRev.

With hysteresis , the OVHYS threshold  is 14.8 V \nand the UVHYS threshold  is 9.1V. For the desired  OV and \nUV 6% accuracy , 1% resistors  used in this example  are \nacceptable .\nValues  for R4 to R6 and R7 to R9 for V2 and V3 are \nsimilarly  calculated .Layout  Considerations\nSheet  resistance  of 1oz copper  is ~530µΩ per square . \nAlthough  small , resistances  add up quickly  in high current  \napplications . Keep  high current  traces  short  with minimum  \ntrace  widths  of 0.02 " per amp to ensure  traces  stay at a \nreasonable  temperatures . Using  0.03 " per amp or wider  \nis recommended . To improve  noise  immunity , place  OV/\nUV resistive  dividers  as close  to the LTC4417  as possible . \nT ransient  voltage  suppressors  should  be located  as close  \nto the input  connector  as possible  with short  wide traces  \nto GND.
