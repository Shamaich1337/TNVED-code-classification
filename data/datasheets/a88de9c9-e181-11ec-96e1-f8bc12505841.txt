The MB85RS64 is able to retain data without using a back-up battery, as is needed for SRAM.The memory cells used in the MB85RS64 can be used for 10\n12 read/write operations, which is a significant\nimprovement over the number of read and write operations supported by Flash memory and E2PROM. \nMB85RS64 does not take long time to write data like Flash memories or E2PROM, and MB85RS64 takes\nno wait time. \n■FEATURES\n• Bit configuration  : 8,192 words × 8 bits\n\x81 Serial Peripheral Interface  : SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) \nCorrespondent to SPI mode 0 (0, 0) and mode 3 (1, 1)\n\x81 Operating frequency  : 20 MHz (Max)\n\x81 High endurance  : 1012 times / byte\n\x81 Data retention  : 10 years ( + 85 °C), 95 years ( + 55 °C), over 200 years ( + 35 °C)\n\x81 Operating power supply voltage  : 2.7 V to 3.6 V\n\x81 Low power consumption  : Operating power supply current 1.5 mA (Typ@20 MHz) \nStandby current 5 μ A (Typ)\n\x81 Operation ambient temperature range :  − 40 °C to +85 °C\n\x81 Package  : 8-pin plastic SOP (FPT -8P-M02) RoHS compliantDS501-00012-6v0-E\nMB85RS64\n2 DS501-00012-6v0-E■PIN ASSIGNMENT\n■PIN FUNCTIONAL DESCRIPTIONS\nPin No. Pin Name Functional description\n1C SChip Select pin\nThis is an input pin to make chip select. When CS  is the “H” level, device is in deselect \n(standby) status and SO becomes High-Z. Inputs from other pins are ignored at this time. When CS\n is the “L” level, device is in select (active) status. CS  has to be the “L” level \nbefore inputting op-code. The Chip Select pin is pulled up internally to the VDD pin.\n3W PWrite Protect pinThis is a pin to control writing to a status register. The writing of status register (see “ ■ \nSTATUS REGISTER”) is protected in related with WP\n and WPEN. See “ ■WRITING \nPROTECT” for detail. \n7H O L DHold pinThis pin is used to interrupt serial input/output without making chip deselect. When HOLD\n is the “L” level, hold operation is activated, SO becomes High-Z, and SCK and SI \nbecome don’t care. While the hold operation, CS  shall be retained the “L” level. \n6S C KSerial Clock pinThis is a clock input pin to input/output serial  data. SI is loaded synchronously to a rising \nedge, SO is output synchr onously to a falling edge. \n5S ISerial Data Input pinThis is an input pin of serial data. This inputs op-code, address, and writing data. \n2S OSerial Data Output pinThis is an output pin of serial data. Reading data of FRAM memory cell array and status register are output.

Op-code is a code composed of 8 bits shown\nin the table below. Do not input invalid codes other than those codes. If CS  is risen while inputting op-code,\nthe command are not performed.Bit No. Bit Name Function\n7 WPENStatus Register Write Protect\nThis is a bit composed of nonvolatile memories (FRAM). WPEN protects writing to a status register (see “ ■ WRITING PROTECT”) relating with WP\n \ninput. Writing with the WRSR command and reading with the RDSR com-mand are possible. \n6 to 4 ⎯Not Used BitsThese are bits composed of nonvolatile memories, writing with the WRSR command is possible, and “000” is written before shipment. These bits are not used but they are read with the RDSR command. \n3 BP1Block ProtectThis is a bit composed of nonvolatile memory. This defines size of write \nprotect block for the WRITE command (see “ ■ BLOCK PROTECT”). \nWriting with the WRSR command and reading with the RDSR command are possible. 2 BP0\n1W E LWrite Enable Latch\nThis indicates FRAM Array and status register are writable. The WREN command is for setting, and the WRDI command is for resetting. With the RDSR command, reading is possible but writing is not possible with the \nWRSR command. WEL is reset after the following operations. \nAfter power ON.After WRDI command recognition.At the rising edge of CS\n after WRSR command recognition.\nAt the rising edge of CS  after WRITE command recognition.\n0 0 This is a bit fixed to “0”. \nName Description Op-code\nWREN Set Write Enable Latch 0000 0110 B\nWRDI Reset Write Enable Latch 0000 0100 B\nRDSR Read Status Register 0000 0101 B\nWRSR Write Status Register 0000 0001 B\nREAD Read Memory Code 0000 0011 B\nWRITE Write Memory Code 0000 0010 B\nMB85RS64\nDS501-00012-6v0-E 7■COMMAND\n• WREN\nThe WREN command sets WEL (Write Enable Latch) . WEL shall be set with the WREN command before\nwriting operation (WRSR command and WRITE command) .\n• WRDI\nThe WRDI command resets WEL (Write Enable Latch) . Writing operation (WRITE command and WRSRcommand) are not performed when WEL is reset.

After op-c ode of RDSR is input to SI, 8-cycle clock is input\nto SCK. The SI value is invalid during this time. SO is output synchronously to a falling edge of SCK. In the\nRDSR command, repeated reading of status register is enabled by sending SCK continuously before rising\nof CS . \n• WRSR\nThe WRSR command writes data to the nonvolatile memory bit of status register. After performing WRSRop-code to a SI pin, 8 bits writing data is input. WEL (W rite Enable Latch) is not able to be written with WRSR\ncommand. A SI value correspondent to bit 1 is ignored. Bit 0 of the status register is fixed to “0” and cannotbe written. The SI value corresponding to bit 0 is ignored. The WP\n signal level shall be fixed before performing\nthe WRSR command, and do not change the WP  signal level until the end of command sequence.

Arbitrary 16 bits address and op-code of READ\nare input to SI. The 3-bit upper address bit is invalid . Then, 8-cycle clock is input to SCK. SO is output\nsynchronously to the falling edg e of SCK. While reading, the SI value is invalid. When CS  is risen, the READ\ncommand is completed, but keeps on reading with automatic address increment which is enabled by con-tinuously sending clocks to SCK in unit of 8 cycles before CS\n rising. When it reaches the most significant\naddress, it rolls over to the starting address, and reading cycle keeps on infinitely.\n• WRITE\nThe WRITE command writes data to FRAM memory cell array. WRITE op-code, arbitrary 16 bits of addressand 8 bits of writing data are input to SI. The 3-bit upper address bit is invalid. When 8 bits of writing data isinput, data is written to FRAM  memory cell array. Risen CS\n will terminate the WRIT E command. However,\nif you continue sending the writing data for 8 bits each before CS  rising, it is possible to continue writing with\nautomatic address increment. When it reaches the most significant address, it rolls over to the startingaddress, and writing cycle keeps on continued infinitely.

The\ntiming for starting and ending hold status depends on the SCK to be the “H” level or the “L” level when aHOLD\n pin input is transited to the hold condition as shown in the diagram below. In case the HOLD  pin\ntransited to “L” level when SCK is “L” level, return the HOLD  pin to “H” level at SCK being “L” level. In the\nsame manner, in case the HOLD  pin transited to “L” level when SCK is “H” level, return the HOLD  pin to “H”\nlevel at SCK being “H” level. Arbitrary command operation is interrupted in hold status, SCK and SI inputsbecome don’t care. And, SO becomes High-Z while reading command (RDSR, READ). If CS\n is rising during\nhold status, a command is aborted. In case the command is aborted before its recognition, WEL holds thevalue before transition to hold status.

#### Description:
The **MB85RS64** is a **Ferroelectric Random Access Memory (FRAM)** chip with a configuration of 64 Kbits (8 K × 8 bits). It utilizes ferroelectric and silicon gate CMOS technologies to create nonvolatile memory cells that retain data without the need for a backup battery, unlike SRAM. The chip communicates via a Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI), supporting SPI modes 0 and 3, and operates at a maximum frequency of 20 MHz.

#### Typical Applications:
The MB85RS64 is suitable for various applications, including:
- **Data Logging**: Ideal for applications requiring frequent data writing and reading without the delays associated with Flash memory.
- **Embedded Systems**: Used in microcontrollers and other embedded systems where nonvolatile memory is essential.
- **Industrial Automation**: Suitable for applications that require high endurance and reliability in data storage.
- **Consumer Electronics**: Can be used in devices that need fast and reliable memory solutions, such as smart meters and wearable devices.

This component is particularly advantageous in scenarios where high write endurance and fast access times are critical, making it a preferred choice over traditional EEPROM and Flash memory solutions.
