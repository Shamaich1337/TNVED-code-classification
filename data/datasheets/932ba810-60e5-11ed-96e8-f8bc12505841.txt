System Overview\nThe CP2105 is a highly integrated USB-to-Dual-UART Bridge Contr oller providing a simple  solution for updating\nRS-232 designs to USB using a minimum of components and PCB spa ce. The CP2105 includes a USB 2.0 full-\nspeed function controller, USB transceiver, oscillator, one-tim e programmable ROM, and two asynchronous serial\ndata buses (UART) with full modem control signals in a compact 4 x 4 mm QFN-24 package  (sometimes called\n“MLF” or “MLP”).\nThe on-chip one-time programmable ROM may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID, Product ID, Product\nD e s c r i p t i o n  S t r i n g ,  P o w e r  D e s c r i p tor, Device Release Number, In terface Strings, Devic e Serial Number, and\nModem/GPIO configuration as de sired for OEM applications.\nRoyalty-free Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers provided by Silicon Labs allow a CP2105-based product to\nappear as two COM ports in PC applications. The CP2105 UART int erfaces implement all RS-232 signals\nincluding control and handshaking, so existing system firmware does not need to be modified. The device also\nfeatures a total of five GPIO si gnals that can be user-defined for status and control in formation. Support for\nI/O interface voltages down to 1.8 V is provided via a VIO pin. Direct access driver support is also available through\nthe Silicon Labs USBXpress driver set. See www.silabs.com  for the latest application notes and product support\ninformation for the CP2105.\nAn evaluation kit for the CP2105 (Part Number: CP2105EK) is ava ilable. It includes a CP2105-based USB-to-\nUART/RS-232 evaluation board, a c omplete set of VCP device driv ers, USB and RS-232 cables, and full\ndocumentation.

USB Function Contro ller and Transceiver\nThe Universal Serial Bus (USB) function controller in the CP210 5 is a USB 2.0 compliant full-speed device with\nintegrated transceiver and on-chip matching and pullup resistor s. The USB function controller manages all data\ntransfers between the USB and the UARTs as well as command requ ests generated by the USB host controller\nand commands for controlling the function of the UARTs and GPIO  pins.\nThe USB Suspend and Resume states are supported for power manag ement of both the CP2105 device as well as\nexternal circuitry. The CP2105 will enter Suspend mode when Sus pend signaling is detected on the bus. On\nentering Suspend mode, the SUSPEND  signals will be assert ed if the corr esponding interface is con figured for\nGPIO mode. SUSPEND  is also asserted after a CP2105 reset until device configurati on during USB Enumeration\nis complete. SUSPEND  is active-low by default, but can be configured using the PROM  to be active high.\nThe CP2105 exits the Suspend mode when any of the following occ ur: Resume signaling is detected or generated,\na USB Reset signal is detected, o r a device reset occurs. On ex it of Suspend mode the SUSPEND  signal is de-\nasserted. SUSPEND  is weakly pulled to VIO in a high impedance state during a CP2 105 reset. If this behavior is\nundesirable, a strong pulldown (10 k \uf057) can be used to ensure SUSPEND  remains low during reset.\nThe logic level and output mode (push-pull or open-drain) of va rious pins during USB Suspend is configurable in\nthe PROM. See Section 9 for more information.\n6.  Asynchronous Serial Dat a Bus (UART) Interfaces\nThe CP2105 contains two UART interfaces, known as the Enhanced Communications Interface (ECI) and\nStandard Communicati ons Interface (SCI)\nEach UART interface consists of the TXD (transmit) and RXD (rec eive) data signals as well as RTS and CTS flow\ncontrol signals. Optionally, the modem control signals DSR, DTR , DCD, and RI can be enabled for each interface.\nIf modem control signals are not required for the application, these pins can be configured to operate with alternate\nfunctions, such as GPIO and SUSPEND  signals. The UARTs support RT S/CTS, DSR/DTR, and X-On/X-Off\nhandshaking. The UARTs are programmable to support a variety of  data formats and baud rates. The ECI supports\nseveral additional UART configuration options beyond those supp orted by the SCI. If the Virtual COM Port drivers\nare used, the data format and baud rate are set during COM port  configuration on the PC . If the USBXpress drivers\nare used, the CP2105 is configured through the USBXpress API. T he data formats and baud rates available to\neach interface are listed in Table 10.\nTable 10.

See “6.1. ECI Baud Rate Generat ion” for more details on possibl e baud rates for the ECI interface.\nCP2105\nRev. 1.2 136.1.  ECI Baud Rate Generation\nThe baud rate generator for the enhanced interface is very flex ible, allowing the user to request any baud rate in\nthe range from 300 bps to 2.0 Mbps. If the baud rate cannot be di rectly generated from t he 48 MHz oscillator, the\ndevice will choose the  closest possible opt ion. The actual baud  rate is dictated by Equ ation 1 and Equation 2. \nEquation 1. Clock Divider Calculation\nEquation 2. Baud Rate Calculation\nMost baud rates can be generated with an error of less than 1.0 %. A general rule of thumb for the majority of UART\napplications is to limit the baud rate error on both the transm itter and the receiver to no more than ±2%. The clock\ndivider value obtained in Equation 1 is rounded to the nearest i nteger, which may produce an error source. Another\nerror source will be the 48 MHz osc illator, which is accurate to  ±0.25%. Knowing the actual and requested baud\nrates, the total baud rate error can be found using Equation 3.\nEquation 3. Baud Rate Error Calculation\nThe UART also supports the transmission of a line break. It can  be set to transmit indefinitely until a stop command\nis sent from the application.\n7.  GPIO Mode and Modem Mode\nEach interface on the CP2105 can be configured in either GPIO M ode or Modem Mode. This allows the SCI and\nECI to have either modem control  signals or GPIO signals availa ble at various pins. Table 11 shows the functions\nthat are available in each mode. By default, both interfaces are  configured for GPIO Mode.\nOnly one mode can be selected for each interface. Also, the mod e of the CP2105 can only be configured once and\ncannot be reset to the default configuration after being progra mmed. Refer to “AN223: Runtime GPIO Control for\nCP210x” for more information on  how to configure  the port pins of the CP2105.Table 11.

GPIO Pins\nThe CP2105 supports five user-configurable GPIO pins for status  and control information. The Standard\nCommunication Interface (SCI) has three GPIO pins and the Enhan ced Communication Interface (ECI) has two\nGPIO pins. To use the pins as GPIO pins, the interface with the  GPIO pins must be configured in GPIO Mode. By\ndefault, both communication interfaces on the CP2105 are config ured for GPIO Mode. If the Modem Control\nsignals are needed, the interface must be configured for Modem Mode. See Section 7 for more information on\nModem Mode. \nEach of these GPIO pins are usable as inputs, open-drain output s, or push-pull outputs. Four of the GPIO pins also\nhave alternate functions listed in Table 12 (GPIO.2_SCI does not  have an alternate function). \nBy default, all of the GPIO pins are configured as a GPIO input . The configuration of the pins is one-time\nprogrammable for each device. The difference between an open-dr ain output and a push-pull output is when the\nGPIO output is driven to logic h igh. A logic high, open-drain o utput pulls the pin to the VIO rail through an internal,\npull-up resistor. A logic high, push-pull output directly conne cts the pin to the VIO voltage. Open-drain outputs are\ntypically used when interfacing t o logic at a higher voltage th an the VIO pin. These pins c an be safely pulled to the\nhigher, external voltage through an external pull-up resistor. The maximum external pull-up voltage is 5 V.\nThe speed of reading and writing the GPIO pins is subject to th e timing of the USB bus. GPIO pins configured as\ninputs or outputs are  not recommended for  real-time signalling.\nMore information regarding the co nfiguration and usage of these  pins can be found in “AN721: CP21xx Device\nCustomization Guide” and “AN223:  Runtime GPIO Control for CP210 x” available on the Silicon Labs website.\n8.1.  GPIO.0-1—Trans mit and Receive Toggle\nGPIO.0 and GPIO.1 are configurable as Transmit Toggle and Recei ve Toggle pins for both the Enhanced\nCommunication Interface and the Standard Communication Interfac e. These pins are logic high when a device is\nnot transmitting or receiving data, and they toggle at a fixed rate as specified in T able 6 when data transfer is in\nprogress. Typically, t hese pins are connected to two LEDs to in dicate data transfer.\nFigure 5. Transmit and Receive Toggle Typical Connection DiagramTable 12.

GPIO.1_ECI—RS-485 Transceiver Bus Control\nGPIO.1_ECI is configurable as an RS-485 bus transceiver control  pin or the Enhanced Communication Interface\nwhich is connected to the DE and RE  inputs of the transceiver. When configured for RS-485 mode, th e pin is\nasserted during UART data transmission as well as line break tr ansmission and the RX Toggle mode is not\navailable. The RS-485 mode of GPI O.1_ECI is active-high by defa ult, and is also configurable for active-low mode. \nFigure 6.

Hardware Flow Control (RTS and CTS)\nTo utilize the functionality o f the RTS and CTS pins of the CP2 105, the device must be co nfigured to use hardware\nflow control.\nRTS, or Ready To Send, is an active-low output from the CP2105 and indicates to the external UART device that\nthe CP2105’s UART RX FIFO has not reached the watermark level o f 191 bytes on the Enhanced Communication\ninterface or 63 bytes on the Standard Communication Interface a nd is ready to accept more data. When the\namount of data in the RX FIFO reaches the watermark, the CP2105  pulls RTS high to indicate to the external\nUART device to stop sending data.\nCTS, or Clear To Send, is an active-low input to the CP2105 and  is used by the external UART device to indicate to\nthe CP2105 when the external UART device’s RX FIFO is getting fu ll. The CP2105 will not send more than two\nbytes of data once CTS is pulled high.\nFigure 7.

One-Time Programmable ROM\nThe CP2105 includes an internal one-time programmable ROM that may be used to customize the USB Vendor ID\n(VID), Product ID (PID), Product Description String, Power Desc riptor, Device Release Number, Interface Strings,\nand Device Serial Number as desi red for OEM applications. If th e programmable ROM has not been programmed,\nthe default configuration data s hown in Table 13 and Table 14 is used.\nWhile customization of the USB configuration data is optional, customizing the VID/PID combination is strongly\nrecommended. A unique VID/PID c ombination will prevent the driv er from conflicting with any other USB driver\nfrom a different manufacturer’s product. A vendor ID can be obt ained from www.usb.org  or Silicon Labs can\nprovide a free PID for the OEM product that can be used with th e Silicon Labs VID. Device serialization is done at\nthe factory to guarantee the ab ility to uniquely identify a spe cific device on the USB bus and other applications.\nThis is accomplished by setting the serial number descriptor st ring that may be queried by the host. By default, a\nunique 32-bit serial number will be generated for each device a t the factory. This numb er will be converted to an\neight-character hexadecimal string. Custom serialization can al so be requested.\nThe configuration data ROM can be programmed by Silicon Labs pr ior to shipment with the desired configuration\ninformation. It can also be programmed in-system over the USB i nterface by adding a capac itor to the PCB. If the\nconfiguration ROM is to be programmed in-system, a 4.7 µF capaci tor must be added between the NC/DCD_ECI/\nVPP pin and ground. No other circu itry should be connected to N C/DCD_ECI/VPP during a programming\noperation, and VDD must remain at 3.3 V or higher to successfully w rite to the con figuration ROM.Table 13.

Voltage Regulator\nThe CP2105 includes an on-chip 5 to 3.45 V voltage regulator. Th is allows the CP2105 to be configured as either a\nUSB bus-powered device or a USB self-powered device. A typical connection diagram of the device in a bus-\npowered application using the regulator is shown in Figure 8. Wh en enabled, the voltage regulator output appears\non the VDD pin and can be used to power external devices. See Table 5 for the voltage regulator electrical\ncharacteristics.\nIf it is desired to use the regulator to provide VDD in a self-powered application, the same connections from\nFigure 8 can be used, but connect  REGIN to an on-board 5 V supply , and disconnect it from the VBUS pin. In\naddition, if REGIN may be unpower ed while VBUS is 5 V, a resisto r divider shown in Note 5 of Figure 9 is required\nto meet the abso lute maximum voltage on VBUS specification in T able 1.\nFigure 8.

For this configurat ion, the REGIN input should be tied to VDD to bypass\nthe voltage regulator. A typical connection diagram showing the  device in a self-powered application with the\nregulator bypassed is shown in Figure 9.\nThe USB max power and power attributes descriptor must match th e device power usage and configuration.

CP2105 Device Drivers\nThere are two sets of device drivers available for CP2105 devic es: the Virtual COM Port  (VCP) drivers and the\nUSBXpress Direct Acce ss drivers. Only one s et of driv ers is nec essary to interfac e with the device.\nThe latest drivers are available at http://www.silabs.com/products/mc u/Pages/SoftwareDownloads.aspx .\n11.1.  Virtual COM Port Drivers\nThe CP2105 Virtual COM Port (VCP) device drivers allow a CP2105 -based device to appear to the PC\'s\napplication software as two COM ports. Application software run ning on the PC accesses the CP2105-based\ndevice as it would access two standard hardware COM ports. Howe ver, actual data transfer between the PC and\nthe CP2105 device is performed over the USB interface. Therefor e, existing COM port applications may be used to\ntransfer data via the USB to t he CP2105-based device without mo difying the application. See application note\n“AN197: Serial Communications Guide for the CP210x” for Example  Code for Interfacing to a CP2105 using the\nVirtual COM drivers.\n11.2.  USBXpress Drivers\nThe Silicon Labs USBXpress driver s provide an alt ernate solutio n for interfacing with CP2105 devices. No serial\nport protocol expertise is required. Instead, a simple, high-le vel application program interface (API) is used to\nprovide simpler CP210x connectivity and functionality. The USBX press for CP210x Development Kit includes\nWindows device drivers, Windows  device driver installer and uni nstallers, and a host interface function library (host\nAPI) provided in the form of a Windows dynamic link library (DL L). The USBXpress driver set is recommended for\nnew products that also include n ew PC software. The USBXpress i nterface is described in application note\n“AN169: USBXpress Pro grammer\'s Guide.”\n11.3.  Driver Customization\nIn addition to customizing the d evice as described in "6. Async hronous Serial Data Bus (UART) Interfaces" on\npage 12, the drivers and the drivers installation package can b e also be customized. See application note “AN220:\nUSB Driver Customization” for more information on generating cu stomized VCP and U SBXpress drivers. \nImportant Note : The VID/PID in the drivers must match the VID/PID in the devi ce for the drivers to load properly\nthen the device is connected to the PC.\n11.4.  Driver Certification\nThe default drivers for the CP2105 are Microsoft Windows Hardwa re Quality Labs (WHQL) certified. The\ncertification means that the dri vers have been tested by Micros oft and their latest operating systems will allow the\ndrivers to be installed without any warnings or errors. \nThe customized drivers that are generated using the AN220 softw are are not automatically certified. To become\ncertified, they must go first through the Microsoft Driver Rese ller Submission process. C ontact Silicon Labs support\nfor assistance with this process.\nCP2105\nRev. 1.2 2112.
