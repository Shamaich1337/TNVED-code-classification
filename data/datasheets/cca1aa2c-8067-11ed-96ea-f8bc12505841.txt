These devices use a highly multiplexed 8-bit bus (I/Ox) to transfer\ncommands, address, and data. There are five control signals used to implement the\nasynchronous data interface: CE#, CLE, ALE, WE#, and RE#. Additional signals control\nhardware write protection and monitor device status (R/B#).\nThis hardware interface creates a low pin-count device with a standard pinout that re-\nmains the same from one density to another, enabling future upgrades to higher densi-\nties with no board redesign.\nA target is the unit of memory accessed by a chip enable signal. A target contains one or\nmore NAND Flash die. A NAND Flash die is the minimum unit that can independently\nexecute commands and report status. A NAND Flash die, in the ONFI specification, is\nreferred to as a logical unit (LUN). There is at least one NAND Flash die per chip enable\nsignal. For further details, see Device and Array Organization.\nSignal Descriptions and Assignments\nTable 1: Asynchronous Signal Definitions\nSignal1Type Description2\nALE Input Address latch enable: Loads an address from I/O[7:0] into the address register.\nCE# Input Chip enable:  Enables or disables one or more die (LUNs) in a target.\nCLE Input Command latch enable:  Loads a command from I/O[7:0] into the command register.\nRE# Input Read enable:  Transfers serial data from the NAND Flash to the host system.\nWE# Input Write enable:  Transfers commands, addresses, and serial data from the host system to the\nNAND Flash.\nWP# Input Write protect:  Enables or disables array PROGRAM and ERASE operations.\nLOCK Input Lock: Enables the BLOCK LOCK function when LOCK is HIGH during power up.

Data, commands,\nand addresses are multiplexed onto the same pins and received by I/O control circuits.\nThe commands received at the I/O control circuits are latched by a command register\nand are transferred to control logic circuits for generating internal signals to control de-\nvice operations. The addresses are latched by an address register and sent to a row de-\ncoder to select a row address, or to a column decoder to select a column address.\nData is transferred to or from the NAND Flash memory array, byte by byte (x8) or word\nby word (x16), through a data register and a cache register.\nThe NAND Flash memory array is programmed and read using page-based operations\nand is erased using block-based operations. During normal page operations, the data\nand cache registers act as a single register. During cache operations, the data and cache\nregisters operate independently to increase data throughput. The status register reports\nthe status of die operations.\nFigure 8: NAND Flash Die (LUN) Functional Block Diagram\n \nAddress register\nData register\nCache registerStatus register\nCommand register\nCE#VCCVSS\nCLE\nALE\nWE#\nRE#\nWP#\nLOCK1I/Ox\nControl\nlogicI/O\ncontrol\nR/B#\nRow decodeColumn decode\nNAND Flash\narray\n(2 planes)\nNote: 1.

I/O[15:8] are used only for data in the x16 configuration. Addresses and\ncommands are always supplied on I/O[7:0].\nThe command sequence typically consists of a COMMAND LATCH cycle, address input\ncycles, and one or more data cycles, either READ or WRITE.\nTable 4: Asynchronous Interface Mode Selection\nMode1CE# CLE ALE WE# RE# I/Ox WP#\nStandby2H X X X X X 0V/V CC\nCommand input L H L H X H\nAddress input L L H H X H\nData input L L L H X H\nData output L L L H X X\nWrite protect X X X X X X L\nNotes: 1. Mode selection settings for this table: H = Logic level HIGH; L = Logic level LOW; X = V IH\nor V IL.\n2. WP# should be biased to CMOS LOW or HIGH for standby.\nAsynchronous Enable/Standby\nWhen the device is not performing an operation, the CE# pin is typically driven HIGH\nand the device enters standby mode. The memory will enter standby if CE# goes HIGH\nwhile data is being transferred and the device is not busy. This helps reduce power con-\nsumption.\nThe CE# “Don’t Care” operation enables the NAND Flash to reside on the same asyn-\nchronous memory bus as other Flash or SRAM devices. Other devices on the memory\nbus can then be accessed while the NAND Flash is busy with internal operations. This\ncapability is important for designs that require multiple NAND Flash devices on the\nsame bus.\nA HIGH CLE signal indicates that a command cycle is taking place. A HIGH ALE signal\nsignifies that an ADDRESS INPUT cycle is occurring.\nAsynchronous Commands\nAn asynchronous command is written from I/O[7:0] to the command register on the ris-\ning edge of WE# when CE# is LOW, ALE is LOW, CLE is HIGH, and RE# is HIGH.\nCommands are typically ignored by die (LUNs) that are busy (RDY = 0); however, some\ncommands, including READ STATUS (70h) and READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h), are\naccepted by die (LUNs) even when they are busy.\nFor devices with a x16 interface, I/O[15:8] must be written with zeros when a command\nis issued.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nAsynchronous Interface Bus Operation\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

The number of cycles required for each command varies. Refer to the command\ndescriptions to determine addressing requirements.\nAddresses are typically ignored by die (LUNs) that are busy (RDY = 0); however, some\naddresses are accepted by die (LUNs) even when they are busy; for example, like ad-\ndress cycles that follow the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command.\nFigure 13: Asynchronous Address Latch Cycle\n \nWE#CE#\nALECLE\n I/OxCol\nadd 1tWP tWHtCS\ntDHtDStALS\ntALHtCLS\nCol\nadd 2Row\nadd 1Row\nadd 2Row\nadd 3\nDon’t Care UndefinedtWCMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nAsynchronous Interface Bus Operation\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nAsynchronous Data Output\nData can be output from a die (LUN) if it is in a READY state. Data output is supported\nfollowing a READ operation from the NAND Flash array. Data is output from the cache\nregister of the selected die (LUN) to I/O[7:0] on the falling edge of RE# when CE# is\nLOW, ALE is LOW, CLE is LOW, and WE# is HIGH.\nIf the host controller is using a tRC of 30ns or greater, the host can latch the data on the\nrising edge of RE# (see the figure below for proper timing). If the host controller is using\na tRC of less than 30ns, the host can latch the data on the next falling edge of RE#.\nUsing the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command prevents data contention follow-\ning an interleaved die (multi-LUN) operation. After issuing the READ STATUS EN-\nHANCED (78h) command, to enable data output, issue the READ MODE (00h) com-\nmand.\nData output requests are typically ignored by a die (LUN) that is busy (RDY = 0); howev-\ner, it is possible to output data from the status register even when a die (LUN) is busy by\nfirst issuing the READ STATUS or READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command.\nFigure 15: Asynchronous Data Output Cycles\n \nCE#\nRE#\nI/OxtREHtRP\ntRRtRCtCEA\ntREAtREAtREA\nDon’t CaretRHZtCHZ\ntRHZ\ntRHOH\nRDYtCOH\nDOUTDOUTDOUTMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nAsynchronous Interface Bus Operation\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

When WP# is LOW, PROGRAM and ERASE operations are disabled. When\nWP# is HIGH, PROGRAM and ERASE operations are enabled.\nIt is recommended that the host drive WP# LOW during power-on until V CC is stable to\nprevent inadvertent PROGRAM and ERASE operations (see Device Initialization for ad-\nditional details).\nWP# must be transitioned only when the target is not busy and prior to beginning a\ncommand sequence. After a command sequence is complete and the target is ready,\nWP# can be transitioned. After WP# is transitioned, the host must wait tWW before issu-\ning a new command.\nThe WP# signal is always an active input, even when CE# is HIGH. This signal should\nnot be multiplexed with other signals.\nReady/Busy#\nThe ready/busy# (R/B#) signal provides a hardware method of indicating whether a tar-\nget is ready or busy. A target is busy when one or more of its die (LUNs) are busy\n(RDY = 0). A target is ready when all of its die (LUNs) are ready (RDY = 1). Because each\ndie (LUN) contains a status register, it is possible to determine the independent status\nof each die (LUN) by polling its status register instead of using the R/B# signal (see Sta-\ntus Operations for details regarding die (LUN) status).\nThis signal requires a pull-up resistor, Rp, for proper operation. R/B# is HIGH when the\ntarget is ready, and transitions LOW when the target is busy.

All rights reserved.\ndriver enables multiple R/B# outputs to be OR-tied. Typically, R/B# is connected to an\ninterrupt pin on the system controller.\nThe combination of Rp and capacitive loading of the R/B# circuit determines the rise\ntime of the R/B# signal. The actual value used for Rp depends on the system timing re-\nquirements. Large values of Rp cause R/B# to be delayed significantly. Between the 10%\nand 90% points on the R/B# waveform, the rise time is approximately two time con-\nstants (TC).\nTC = R × C\nWhere R = Rp (resistance of pull-up resistor), and C = total capacitive load.\nThe fall time of the R/B# signal is determined mainly by the output impedance of the\nR/B# signal and the total load capacitance. Approximate Rp values using a circuit load\nof 100pF are provided in Figure 22 (page 28).\nThe minimum value for Rp is determined by the output drive capability of the R/B# sig-\nnal, the output voltage swing, and V CC.\nRp =VCC (MAX) - VOL (MAX)\nIOL + ΣIL\nWhere ΣIL is the sum of the input currents of all devices tied to the R/B# pin. \nFigure 17: READ/BUSY# Open Drain\nRpVCC\nR/B#\nOpen drain output\nIOL\nVSS\nDeviceMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nAsynchronous Interface Bus Operation\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

(The WP# signal supports additional hardware\nprotection during power transitions.) When ramping V CC, use the following procedure\nto initialize the device:\n1. Ramp V CC.\n2. The host must wait for R/B# to be valid and HIGH before issuing RESET (FFh) to\nany target. The R/B# signal becomes valid when 50µs has elapsed since the begin-\nning the V CC ramp, and 10µs has elapsed since V CC reaches V CC (MIN).\n3. If not monitoring R/B#, the host must wait at least 100µs after V CC reaches V CC\n(MIN). If monitoring R/B#, the host must wait until R/B# is HIGH.\n4. The asynchronous interface is active by default for each target. Each LUN draws\nless than an average of 10mA (I ST) measured over intervals of 1ms until the RESET\n(FFh) command is issued.\n5. The RESET (FFh) command must be the first command issued to all targets (CE#s)\nafter the NAND Flash device is powered on. Each target will be busy for 1ms after a\nRESET command is issued. The RESET busy time can be monitored by polling\nR/B# or issuing the READ STATUS (70h) command to poll the status register.\n6. The device is now initialized and ready for normal operation.\nFigure 23: R/B# Power-On Behavior\n \nReset (FFh)\nis issued50µs (MIN)\n100µs (MAX)\nInvalid10µs\n(MAX)\nVCC ramp\nstartsVCC\nR/B#VCC = VCC (MIN)Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nDevice Initialization\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

The contents of the memory location being programmed or the block being\nerased are no longer valid. The data may be partially erased or programmed, and is in-\nvalid. The command register is cleared and is ready for the next command. The data\nregister and cache register contents are marked invalid.\nThe status register contains the value E0h when WP# is HIGH; otherwise it is written\nwith a 60h value. R/B# goes LOW for tRST after the RESET command is written to the\ncommand register.\nThe RESET command must be issued to all CE#s as the first command after power-on.\nThe device will be busy for a maximum of 1ms.\nFigure 24: RESET (FFh) Operation\nCycle type\nI/O[7:0]\nR/B#tRSTtWBFFCommandMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nReset Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

This command is accepted by the target only when all die (LUNs) on the target are\nidle.\nWriting 90h to the command register puts the target in read ID mode. The target stays in\nthis mode until another valid command is issued.\nWhen the 90h command is followed by an 00h address cycle, the target returns a 5-byte\nidentifier code that includes the manufacturer ID, device configuration, and part-spe-\ncific information.\nWhen the 90h command is followed by a 20h address cycle, the target returns the 4-byte\nONFI identifier code.\nFigure 25: READ ID (90h) with 00h Address Operation\nCycle type\nI/O[7:0]tWHRCommand\n90h 00h Byte 0 Byte 1 Byte 2 Byte 3Address DOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUT\nByte 4\nNote: 1.

This command is accepted by the target only when all die\n(LUNs) on the target are idle.\nWriting ECh to the command register puts the target in read parameter page mode. The\ntarget stays in this mode until another valid command is issued.\nWhen the ECh command is followed by an 00h address cycle, the target goes busy for tR.\nIf the READ STATUS (70h) command is used to monitor for command completion, the\nREAD MODE (00h) command must be used to re-enable data output mode. Use of the\nREAD STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command is prohibited while the target is busy and\nduring data output.\nTo insure data integrity, x8 devices contain at least eight copies of the parameter page,\nand x16 devices contain at least four copies of the parameter page. Each parameter\npage is 256 bytes. If the initial READ PARAMETER PAGE (ECh) command fails to retrieve\na correct copy of the parameter page, the command can be reissued until a correct copy\nis retrieved.

This command is accepted by the target only when all die (LUNs) on the\ntarget are idle.\nWriting EDh to the command register puts the target in read unique ID mode. The tar-\nget stays in this mode until another valid command is issued.\nWhen the EDh command is followed by an 00h address cycle, the target goes busy for\ntR. If the READ STATUS (70h) command is used to monitor for command completion,\nthe READ MODE (00h) command must be used to re-enable data output mode.\nAfter tR completes, the host enables data output mode to read the unique ID. When the\nasynchronous interface is active, one data byte is output per RE# toggle.\nSixteen copies of the unique ID data are stored in the device. Each copy is 32 bytes. The\nfirst 16 bytes of a 32-byte copy are unique data, and the second 16 bytes are the comple-\nment of the first 16 bytes. The host should XOR the first 16 bytes with the second 16\nbytes. If the result is 16 bytes of FFh, then that copy of the unique ID data is correct. In\nthe event that a non-FFh result is returned, the host can repeat the XOR operation on a\nsubsequent copy of the unique ID data. If desired, the RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h)\ncommand can be used to change the data output location.\nThe upper eight I/Os on a x16 device are not used and are a “Don’t Care” for x16 devi-\nces.\nFigure 28: READ UNIQUE ID (EDh) Operation\n \nCycle type\n I/O[7:0]\nR/B#tWBtRtRRCommand Address DOUT\nEDh 00h U00 U10DOUTDOUT\n… U01DOUTDOUT\nU11 …DOUTMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nREAD UNIQUE ID (EDh)\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

These commands use a one-byte feature address to\ndetermine which subfeature parameters will be read or modified. Each feature address\n(in the 00h to FFh range) is defined in below. The SET FEATURES (EFh) command\nwrites subfeature parameters (P1–P4) to the specified feature address.

The contents of the status register are returned on I/\nO[7:0] for each data output request.\nWhen the asynchronous interface is active and status register output is enabled,\nchanges in the status register are seen on I/O[7:0] as long as CE# and RE# are LOW; it is\nnot necessary to toggle RE# to see the status register update.\nWhile monitoring the status register to determine when a data transfer from the Flash\narray to the data register (tR) is complete, the host must issue the READ MODE (00h)\ncommand to disable the status register and enable data output (see Read Operations).\nThe READ STATUS (70h) command returns the status of the most recently selected die\n(LUN). To prevent data contention during or following an interleaved die (multi-LUN)\noperation, the host must enable only one die (LUN) for status output by using the READ\nSTATUS ENHANCED (78h) command (see Interleaved Die (Multi-LUN) Operations).\nTable 15: Status Register Definition\nSR Bit Program PageProgram Page\nCache Mode Page ReadPage Read \nCache Mode Block Erase Description\n7 Write protect Write protect Write protect Write protect Write protect 0 = Protected\n1 = Not protected\n6 RDY RDY cache1RDY RDY cache1RDY 0 = Busy\n1 = Ready\n5 ARDY ARDY2ARDY ARDY2ARDY 0 = Busy\n1 = Ready\n4 – – – – – Reserved (0)\n3 – – – – – Reserved (0)\n2 – – – – – Reserved (0)\n1 – FAILC (N–1) – – – 0 = Pass\n1 = Fail\n0 FAIL FAIL (N) – – FAIL 0 = Pass\n1 = Fail\nNotes: 1.

If cache mode is\nused, this bit will be 1 when all internal operations are complete.\nREAD STATUS (70h)\nThe READ STATUS (70h) command returns the status of the last-selected die (LUN) on\na target. This command is accepted by the last-selected die (LUN) even when it is busy\n(RDY = 0).\nIf there is only one die (LUN) per target, the READ STATUS (70h) command can be used\nto return status following any NAND command.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nStatus Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nIn devices that have more than one die (LUN) per target, during and following inter-\nleaved die (multi-LUN) operations, the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command\nmust be used to select the die (LUN) that should report status. In this situation, using\nthe READ STATUS (70h) command will result in bus contention, as two or more die\n(LUNs) could respond until the next operation is issued. The READ STATUS (70h) com-\nmand can be used following all single-die (LUN) operations.\nFigure 31: READ STATUS (70h) Operation\nCycle type\nI/O[7:0]tWHRCommand DOUT\n70h SR\nREAD STATUS ENHANCED (78h)\nThe READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command returns the status of the addressed die\n(LUN) on a target even when it is busy (RDY = 0). This command is accepted by all die\n(LUNs), even when they are BUSY (RDY = 0).\nWriting 78h to the command register, followed by three row address cycles containing\nthe page, block, and LUN addresses, puts the selected die (LUN) into read status mode.\nThe selected die (LUN) stays in this mode until another valid command is issued. Die\n(LUNs) that are not addressed are deselected to avoid bus contention.\nThe selected LUN's status is returned when the host requests data output. The RDY and\nARDY bits of the status register are shared for all planes on the selected die (LUN). The\nFAILC and FAIL bits are specific to the plane specified in the row address.\nThe READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command also enables the selected die (LUN) for\ndata output. To begin data output following a READ-series operation after the selected\ndie (LUN) is ready (RDY = 1), issue the READ MODE (00h) command, then begin data\noutput. If the host needs to change the cache register that will output data, use the\nRANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) command after the die (LUN) is ready.\nUse of the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command is prohibited during the power-\non RESET (FFh) command and when OTP mode is enabled.

These features provide host flexibility for man-\naging data, especially when the host internal buffer is smaller than the number of data\nbytes or words in the cache register.\nWhen the asynchronous interface is active, column address operations can address any\nbyte in the selected cache register.\nRANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h)\nThe RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command changes the column address of the se-\nlected cache register and enables data output from the last selected die (LUN). This\ncommand is accepted by the selected die (LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1; ARDY = 1). It\nis also accepted by the selected die (LUN) during CACHE READ operations\n(RDY = 1; ARDY = 0).\nWriting 05h to the command register, followed by two column address cycles containing\nthe column address, followed by the E0h command, puts the selected die (LUN) into\ndata output mode. After the E0h command cycle is issued, the host must wait at least\ntWHR before requesting data output. The selected die (LUN) stays in data output mode\nuntil another valid command is issued.\nIn devices with more than one die (LUN) per target, during and following interleaved\ndie (multi-LUN) operations, the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command must be\nissued prior to issuing the RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h). In this situation, using the\nRANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command without the READ STATUS ENHANCED\n(78h) command will result in bus contention because two or more die (LUNs) could\noutput data.\nFigure 33: RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) Operation\n \nCycle type\nI/O[7:0]\nSR[6]Command Address Address\n05hCommand\nE0h C1 C2tWHRtRHWDOUT\nDkDOUT\nDk + 1DOUT\nDk + 2DOUT\nDnDOUT\nDn + 1Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nColumn Address Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

This com-\nmand is accepted by a die (LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1; ARDY = 1).\nWriting 06h to the command register, followed by two column address cycles and three\nrow address cycles, followed by E0h, enables data output mode on the address LUN’s\ncache register at the specified column address. After the E0h command cycle is issued,\nthe host must wait at least tWHR before requesting data output. The selected die (LUN)\nstays in data output mode until another valid command is issued.\nFollowing a two-plane read page operation, the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE\n(06h-E0h) command is used to select the cache register to be enabled for data output.\nAfter data output is complete on the selected plane, the command can be issued again\nto begin data output on another plane.\nIn devices with more than one die (LUN) per target, after all of the die (LUNs) on the\ntarget are ready (RDY = 1), the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) command\ncan be used following an interleaved die (multi-LUN) read operation. Die (LUNs) that\nare not addressed are deselected to avoid bus contention.\nIn devices with more than one die (LUN) per target, during interleaved die (multi-LUN)\noperations where more than one or more die (LUNs) are busy (RDY = 1; ARDY = 0 or\nRDY = 0; ARDY = 0), the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command must be issued to\nthe die (LUN) to be selected prior to issuing the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE\n(06h-E0h). In this situation, using the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h)\ncommand without the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command will result in bus\ncontention, as two or more die (LUNs) could output data.\nIf there is a need to update the column address without selecting a new cache register\nor LUN, the RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command can be used instead.\nFigure 34: RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) Operation\n \nCycle \ntype\nI/O[7:0]Command Address Address\n06hCommand\nE0h C1 C2Address Address\nR1 R2Address\nR3tWHRtRHWDOUT\nDkDOUT\nDk + 1DOUT\nDk + 2DOUT\nDnDOUT\nDn + 1Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nColumn Address Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

This command\nis accepted by the selected die (LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1; ARDY = 1). It is also ac-\ncepted by the selected die (LUN) during cache program operations\n(RDY = 1; ARDY = 0).\nWriting 85h to the command register, followed by two column address cycles containing\nthe column address, puts the selected die (LUN) into data input mode. After the second\naddress cycle is issued, the host must wait at least tADL before inputting data. The se-\nlected die (LUN) stays in data input mode until another valid command is issued.\nThough data input mode is enabled, data input from the host is optional. Data input\nbegins at the column address specified.\nThe RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h) command is allowed after the required address cycles\nare specified, but prior to the final command cycle (10h, 11h, 15h) of the following com-\nmands while data input is permitted: PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h), PROGRAM PAGE\nCACHE (80h-15h), PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-10h), and PROGRAM\nFOR TWO-PLANE INTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-11h).\nIn devices that have more than one die (LUN) per target, the RANDOM DATA INPUT\n(85h) command can be used with other commands that support interleaved die (multi-\nLUN) operations.\nFigure 35: RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h) Operation\n \nCycle type\nI/O[7:0]\nRDYCommand Address Address\n85h C1 C2tADLDIN\nDkDIN\nDk + 1DIN\nDk + 2DIN\nDnDIN\nDn + 1As defined for PAGE\n(CACHE) PROGRAMAs defined for PAGE\n(CACHE) PROGRAMMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nColumn Address Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

It also changes the column address of the selected cache register and ena-\nbles data input on the specified die (LUN). This command is accepted by the selected\ndie (LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1; ARDY = 1). It is also accepted by the selected die\n(LUN) during cache programming operations (RDY = 1; ARDY = 0).\nWrite 85h to the command register. Then write two column address cycles and three\nrow address cycles. This updates the page and block destination of the selected device\nfor the addressed LUN and puts the cache register into data input mode. After the fifth\naddress cycle is issued the host must wait at least tADL before inputting data. The selec-\nted LUN stays in data input mode until another valid command is issued. Though data\ninput mode is enabled, data input from the host is optional. Data input begins at the\ncolumn address specified.\nThe PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h) command is allowed after the re-\nquired address cycles are specified, but prior to the final command cycle (10h, 11h, 15h)\nof the following commands while data input is permitted: PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h),\nPROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h), PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h), PRO-\nGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-10h), and PROGRAM FOR TWO-PLANE IN-\nTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-11h). When used with these commands, the LUN address\nand plane select bits are required to be identical to the LUN address and plane select\nbits originally specified.\nThe PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h) command enables the host to mod-\nify the original page and block address for the data in the cache register to a new page\nand block address.\nIn devices that have more than one die (LUN) per target, the PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL\nDATA INPUT (85h) command can be used with other commands that support inter-\nleaved die (multi-LUN) operations.\nThe PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h) command can be used with the\nRANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) or RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h)\ncommands to read and modify cache register contents in small sections prior to pro-\ngramming cache register contents to the NAND Flash array. This capability can reduce\nthe amount of buffer memory used in the host controller.\nThe RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h) command can be used during the PROGRAM FOR\nINTERNAL DATA MOVE command sequence to modify one or more bytes of the origi-\nnal data. First, data is copied into the cache register using the 00h-35h command se-\nquence, then the RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h) command is written along with the ad-\ndress of the data to be modified next. New data is input on the external data pins. This\ncopies the new data into the cache register.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nColumn Address Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

After\ntR (R/B# is HIGH and RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), issue either of these commands:\n• READ PAGE CACHE SEQUENTIAL (31h) – copies the next sequential page from the\nNAND Flash array to the data register\n• READ PAGE CACHE RANDOM (00h-31h) – copies the page specified in this command\nfrom the NAND Flash array to its corresponding data register\nAfter the READ PAGE CACHE series (31h, 00h-31h) command has been issued, R/B#\ngoes LOW on the target, and RDY = 0 and ARDY = 0 on the die (LUN) for tRCBSY while\nthe next page begins copying data from the array to the data register. After tRCBSY,\nR/B# goes HIGH and the die’s (LUN’s) status register bits indicate the device is busy\nwith a cache operation (RDY = 1, ARDY = 0). The cache register becomes available and\nthe page requested in the READ PAGE CACHE operation is transferred to the data regis-\nter. At this point, data can be output from the cache register, beginning at column ad-\ndress 0. The RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command can be used to change the col-\numn address of the data output by the die (LUN).\nAfter outputting the desired number of bytes from the cache register, either an addi-\ntional READ PAGE CACHE series (31h, 00h-31h) operation can be started or the READ\nPAGE CACHE LAST (3Fh) command can be issued.\nIf the READ PAGE CACHE LAST (3Fh) command is issued, R/B# goes LOW on the target,\nand RDY = 0 and ARDY = 0 on the die (LUN) for tRCBSY while the data register is copied\ninto the cache register. After tRCBSY, R/B# goes HIGH and RDY = 1 and\nARDY = 1, indicating that the cache register is available and that the die (LUN) is ready.\nData can then be output from the cache register, beginning at column address 0. The\nRANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command can be used to change the column address\nof the data being output.\nFor READ PAGE CACHE series (31h, 00h-31h, 3Fh), during the die (LUN) busy time,\ntRCBSY, when RDY = 0 and ARDY = 0, the only valid commands are status operations\n(70h, 78h) and RESET (FFh). When RDY = 1 and ARDY = 0, the only valid commands\nduring READ PAGE CACHE series (31h, 00h-31h) operations are status operations (70h,\n78h), READ MODE (00h), READ PAGE CACHE series (31h, 00h-31h), RANDOM DATA\nREAD (05h-E0h), and RESET (FFh).Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nRead Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

This is done by pre-\npending one or more READ PAGE TWO-PLANE (00h-00h-30h) commands in front of\nthe READ PAGE (00h-30h) command.\nWhen the die (LUN) is ready, the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) com-\nmand determines which plane outputs data. During data output, the following com-\nmands can be used to read and modify the data in the cache registers: RANDOM DATA\nREAD (05h-E0h) and RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h).\nTwo-Plane Read Cache Operations\nTwo-plane read cache operations can be used to output data from more than one cache\nregister while concurrently copying one or more pages from the NAND Flash array to\nthe data register. This is done by prepending READ PAGE TWO-PLANE (00h-00h-30h)\ncommands in front of the PAGE READ CACHE RANDOM (00h-31h) command.\nTo begin a two-plane read page cache sequence, begin by issuing a READ PAGE TWO-\nPLANE operation using the READ PAGE TWO-PLANE (00h-00h-30h) and READ PAGE\n(00h-30h) commands. R/B# goes LOW during tR and the selected die (LUN) is busy\n(RDY = 0, ARDY = 0). After tR (R/B# is HIGH and RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), issue either of these\ncommands:\n• READ PAGE CACHE SEQUENTIAL (31h) – copies the next sequential pages from the\npreviously addressed planes from the NAND Flash array to the data registers.\n• READ PAGE TWO-PLANE (00h-00h-30h) [in some cases, followed by READ PAGE\nCACHE RANDOM (00h-31h)] – copies the pages specified from the NAND Flash array\nto the corresponding data registers.\nAfter the READ PAGE CACHE series (31h, 00h-31h) command has been issued, R/B#\ngoes LOW on the target, and RDY = 0 and ARDY = 0 on the die (LUN) for tRCBSY while\nthe next pages begin copying data from the array to the data registers. After tRCBSY,\nR/B# goes HIGH and the LUN’s status register bits indicate the device is busy with a\ncache operation (RDY = 1, ARDY = 0). The cache registers become available and the pa-\nges requested in the READ PAGE CACHE operation are transferred to the data registers.\nIssue the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) command to determine which\ncache register will output data. After data is output, the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-\nPLANE (06h-E0h) command can be used to output data from other cache registers. Af-\nter a cache register has been selected, the RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command\ncan be used to change the column address of the data output.\nAfter outputting data from the cache registers, either an additional TWO-PLANE READ\nCACHE series (31h, 00h-31h) operation can be started or the READ PAGE CACHE LAST\n(3Fh) command can be issued.\nIf the READ PAGE CACHE LAST (3Fh) command is issued, R/B# goes LOW on the target,\nand RDY = 0 and ARDY = 0 on the die (LUN) for tRCBSY while the data registers are cop-\nied into the cache registers. After tRCBSY, R/B# goes HIGH and RDY = 1 and ARDY = 1,\nindicating that the cache registers are available and that the die (LUN) is ready. Issue the\nRANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) command to determine which cache\nregister will output data. After data is output, the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE\n(06h-E0h) command can be used to output data from other cache registers.

This command is accepted by the die\n(LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1).\nTo read a page from the NAND Flash array, write the 00h command to the command\nregister, then write n address cycles to the address registers, and conclude with the 30h\ncommand. The selected die (LUN) will go busy (RDY = 0, ARDY = 0) for tR as data is\ntransferred.\nTo determine the progress of the data transfer, the host can monitor the target's R/B#\nsignal or, alternatively, the status operations (70h, 78h) can be used. If the status opera-\ntions are used to monitor the LUN's status, when the die (LUN) is ready\n(RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), the host disables status output and enables data output by issuing\nthe READ MODE (00h) command.

It is preceded by one or more READ PAGE TWO-PLANE (00h-00h-30h) com-\nmands. Data is transferred from the NAND Flash array for all of the addressed planes to\ntheir respective cache registers. When the die (LUN) is ready\n(RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), data output is enabled for the cache register linked to the plane\naddressed in the READ PAGE (00h-30h) command. When the host requests data output,\noutput begins at the column address last specified in the READ PAGE (00h-30h) com-\nmand.

This command is accepted by\nthe die (LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1). It is also accepted by the die (LUN)\nduring READ PAGE CACHE (31h, 00h-31h) operations (RDY = 1 and ARDY = 0).\nTo issue the READ PAGE CACHE LAST (3Fh) command, write 3Fh to the command reg-\nister. After this command is issued, R/B# goes LOW and the die (LUN) is busy\n(RDY = 0, ARDY = 0) for tRCBSY. After tRCBSY, R/B# goes HIGH and the die (LUN) is\nready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1). At this point, data can be output from the cache register, be-\nginning at column address 0. The RANDOM DATA READ (05h-E0h) command can be\nused to change the column address of the data being output from the cache register.\nIn devices that have more than one LUN per target, during and following interleaved die\n(multi-LUN) operations the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command followed by\nthe READ MODE (00h) command must be used to select only one die (LUN) and pre-\nvent bus contention.\nFigure 40: READ PAGE CACHE LAST (3Fh) Operation\n \nCycle type\nI/O[7:0]\nRDYtWBtRCBSYtRRCommand Command DOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUTDOUT\n31h\ntWBtRCBSYtRRD0 D0 … DnAs defined for\nREAD PAGE CACHE\n(SEQUENTIAL OR RANDOM)\n… Dn3Fh\nPage N Page Address NMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nRead Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

It transfers two pages of data from the NAND Flash array to the da-\nta registers. Each page must be from a different plane on the same die.\nTo enter the READ PAGE TWO-PLANE mode, write the 00h command to the command\nregister, and then write five address cycles for plane 0 (BA6 = 0). Next, write the 00h\ncommand to the command register, and five address cycles for plane 1 (BA6 = 1). Final-\nly, issue the 30h command. The first-plane and second-plane addresses must meet the\ntwo-plane addressing requirements, and, in addition, they must have identical column\naddresses.\nAfter the 30h command is written, page data is transferred from both planes to their re-\nspective data registers in tR. During these transfers, R/B# goes LOW. When the transfers\nare complete, R/B# goes HIGH. To read out the data from the plane 0 data register,\npulse RE# repeatedly. After the data cycle from the plane 0 address completes, issue a\nRANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h) command to select the plane 1 address,\nthen repeatedly pulse RE# to read out the data from the plane 1 data register.\nAlternatively, the READ STATUS (70h) command can monitor data transfers. When the\ntransfers are complete, status register bit 6 is set to 1. To read data from the first of the\ntwo planes, the user must first issue the RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h)\ncommand and pulse RE# repeatedly.\nWhen the data cycle is complete, issue a RANDOM DATA READ TWO-PLANE (06h-E0h)\ncommand to select the other plane. To output the data beginning at the specified col-\numn address, pulse RE# repeatedly.\nUse of the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command is prohibited during and follow-\ning a PAGE READ TWO-PLANE operation.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nRead Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

During a program operation the contents of the cache and/or data registers are\nmodified by the internal control logic.\nWithin a block, pages must be programmed sequentially from the least significant page\naddress to the most significant page address (0, 1, 2, ….., 63). During a program opera-\ntion, the contents of the cache and/or data registers are modified by the internal control\nlogic.\nProgram Operations\nThe PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h) command, when not preceded by the PROGRAM PAGE\nTWO-PLANE (80h-11h) command, programs one page from the cache register to the\nNAND Flash array. When the die (LUN) is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), the host should\ncheck the FAIL bit to verify that the operation has completed successfully.\nProgram Cache Operations\nThe PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h) command can be used to improve program op-\neration system performance. When this command is issued, the die (LUN) goes busy\n(RDY = 0, ARDY = 0) while the cache register contents are copied to the data register,\nand the die (LUN) is busy with a program cache operation (RDY = 1, ARDY = 0. While\nthe contents of the data register are moved to the NAND Flash array, the cache register\nis available for an additional PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h) or PROGRAM PAGE\n(80h-10h) command.\nFor PROGRAM PAGE CACHE series (80h-15h) operations, during the die (LUN) busy\ntimes, tCBSY and tLPROG, when RDY = 0 and ARDY = 0, the only valid commands are\nstatus operations (70h, 78h) and reset (FFh). When RDY = 1 and ARDY = 0, the only valid\ncommands during PROGRAM PAGE CACHE series (80h-15h) operations are status op-\nerations (70h, 78h), PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h), PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h),\nRANDOM DATA INPUT (85h), PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h), and RE-\nSET (FFh).\nTwo-Plane Program Operations\nThe PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h) command can be used to improve pro-\ngram operation system performance by enabling multiple pages to be moved from the\ncache registers to different planes of the NAND Flash array. This is done by prepending\none or more PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h) commands in front of the PRO-\nGRAM PAGE (80h-10h) command.\nTwo-Plane Program Cache Operations\nThe PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h) command can be used to improve pro-\ngram cache operation system performance by enabling multiple pages to be moved\nfrom the cache registers to the data registers and, while the pages are being transferred\nfrom the data registers to different planes of the NAND Flash array, free the cache regis-\nters to receive data input from the host.

This command is accepted by the die (LUN)\nwhen it is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1). It is also accepted by the die (LUN) when it is busy\nwith a PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h) operation (RDY = 1, ARDY = 0).\nTo input a page to the cache register and move it to the NAND array at the block and\npage address specified, write 80h to the command register. Unless this command has\nbeen preceded by a PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h) command, issuing the 80h\nto the command register clears all of the cache registers' contents on the selected target.\nThen write n address cycles containing the column address and row address. Data input\ncycles follow. Serial data is input beginning at the column address specified. At any time\nduring the data input cycle the RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h) and PROGRAM FOR IN-\nTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h) commands may be issued. When data input is complete,\nwrite 10h to the command register. The selected LUN will go busy\n(RDY = 0, ARDY = 0) for tPROG as data is transferred.\nTo determine the progress of the data transfer, the host can monitor the target's R/B#\nsignal or, alternatively, the status operations (70h, 78h) may be used. When the die\n(LUN) is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), the host should check the status of the FAIL bit.\nIn devices that have more than one die (LUN) per target, during and following inter-\nleaved die (multi-LUN) operations, the READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command\nmust be used to select only one die (LUN) for status output.

This command can be issued one or more times. Each\ntime a new plane address is specified that plane is also queued for data transfer. To in-\nput data for the final plane and to begin the program operation for all previously\nqueued planes, issue either the PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h) command or the PROGRAM\nPAGE CACHE (80h-15h) command. All of the queued planes will move the data to the\nNAND Flash array. This command is accepted by the die (LUN) when it is ready\n(RDY = 1).\nTo input a page to the cache register and queue it to be moved to the NAND Flash array\nat the block and page address specified, write 80h to the command register. Unless this\ncommand has been preceded by a PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h) command,\nissuing the 80h to the command register clears all of the cache registers' contents on the\nselected target. Write five address cycles containing the column address and row ad-\ndress; data input cycles follow. Serial data is input beginning at the column address\nspecified. At any time during the data input cycle, the RANDOM DATA INPUT (85h) and\nPROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h) commands can be issued. When data\ninput is complete, write 11h to the command register. The selected die (LUN) will go\nbusy (RDY = 0, ARDY = 0) for tDBSY.\nTo determine the progress of tDBSY, the host can monitor the target's R/B# signal or,\nalternatively, the status operations (70h, 78h) can be used. When the LUN's status\nshows that it is ready (RDY = 1), additional PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h)\ncommands can be issued to queue additional planes for data transfer. Alternatively, the\nPROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h) or PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h) commands can be is-\nsued.\nWhen the PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h) command is used as the final command of a two-\nplane program operation, data is transferred from the cache registers to the NAND\nFlash array for all of the addressed planes during tPROG. When the die (LUN) is ready\n(RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), the host should check the status of the FAIL bit for each of the\nplanes to verify that programming completed successfully.\nWhen the PROGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h) command is used as the final command\nof a program cache two-plane operation, data is transferred from the cache registers to\nthe data registers after the previous array operations finish. The data is then moved\nfrom the data registers to the NAND Flash array for all of the addressed planes. This oc-\ncurs during tCBSY. After tCBSY, the host should check the status of the FAILC bit for\neach of the planes from the previous program cache operation, if any, to verify that pro-\ngramming completed successfully.\nFor the PROGRAM PAGE TWO-PLANE (80h-11h), PROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h), and PRO-\nGRAM PAGE CACHE (80h-15h) commands, see Two-Plane Operations for two-plane ad-\ndressing requirements.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nProgram Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

When the\ndie (LUN) is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1), the host should check the FAIL bit to verify that\nthis operation completed successfully.\nTWO-PLANE ERASE Operations\nThe ERASE BLOCK TWO-PLANE (60h-D1h) command can be used to further system\nperformance of erase operations by allowing more than one block to be erased in the\nNAND array. This is done by prepending one or more ERASE BLOCK TWO-PLANE (60h-\nD1h) commands in front of the ERASE BLOCK (60h-D0h) command. See Two-Plane\nOperations for details.\nERASE BLOCK (60h-D0h)\nThe ERASE BLOCK (60h-D0h) command erases the specified block in the NAND Flash\narray. This command is accepted by the die (LUN) when it is ready (RDY = 1, ARDY = 1).\nTo erase a block, write 60h to the command register. Then write three address cycles\ncontaining the row address; the page address is ignored. Conclude by writing D0h to the\ncommand register. The selected die (LUN) will go busy (RDY = 0, ARDY = 0) for tBERS\nwhile the block is erased.\nTo determine the progress of an ERASE operation, the host can monitor the target's \nR/B# signal, or alternatively, the status operations (70h, 78h) can be used.

This command can be issued one or more\ntimes. Each time a new plane address is specified, that plane is also queued for a block\nto be erased. To specify the final block to be erased and to begin the ERASE operation\nfor all previously queued planes, issue the ERASE BLOCK (60h-D0h) command.

This is particularly useful for block man-\nagement and wear leveling. The INTERNAL DATA MOVE operation is restricted to only\nwithin even blocks or only within odd blocks.\nThe INTERNAL DATA MOVE operation is a two-step process consisting of a READ FOR\nINTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h) and a PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE\n(85h-10h) command. To move data from one page to another, first issue the READ FOR\nINTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h) command. When the die (LUN) is ready (RDY = 1,\nARDY = 1), the host can transfer the data to a new page by issuing the PROGRAM FOR\nINTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-10h) command. When the die (LUN) is again ready (RDY\n= 1, ARDY = 1), the host should check the FAIL bit to verify that this operation comple-\nted successfully.\nTo prevent bit errors from accumulating over multiple INTERNAL DATA MOVE opera-\ntions, it is recommended that the host read the data out of the cache register after the\nREAD FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h) completes and prior to issuing the PRO-\nGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-10h) command. The RANDOM DATA READ\n(05h-E0h) command can be used to change the column address. The host should check\nthe data for ECC errors and correct them. When the PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA\nMOVE (85h-10h) command is issued, any corrected data can be input. The PROGRAM\nFOR INTERNAL DATA INPUT (85h) command can be used to change the column ad-\ndress.\nBetween the READ FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h) and PROGRAM FOR INTER-\nNAL DATA MOVE (85h-10h) commands, the following commands are supported: status\noperation (70h) and column address operations (05h-E0h, 85h). The RESET operation\n(FFh) can be issued after READ FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h), but the con-\ntents of the cache registers on the target are not valid.\nREAD FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h)\nThe READ FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (00h-35h) command is functionally identical to\nthe READ PAGE (00h-30h) command, except that 35h is written to the command regis-\nter instead of 30h.\nIt is recommended that the host read the data out of the device to verify the data prior\nto issuing the PROGRAM FOR INTERNAL DATA MOVE (85h-10h) command to prevent\nthe propagation of data errors.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nInternal Data Move Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

Using the block lock feature is preferable to using WP# to pre-\nvent PROGRAM and ERASE operations.\nBlock lock is enabled and disabled at power-on through the LOCK pin. At power-on, if\nLOCK is LOW, all BLOCK LOCK commands are disabled. However if LOCK is HIGH at\npower-on, the BLOCK LOCK commands are enabled and, by default, all the blocks on\nthe device are protected, or locked, from PROGRAM and ERASE operations, even if WP#\nis HIGH.\nBefore the contents of the device can be modified, the device must first be unlocked.\nEither a range of blocks or the entire device may be unlocked. PROGRAM and ERASE\noperations complete successfully only in the block ranges that have been unlocked.\nBlocks, once unlocked, can be locked again to protect them from further PROGRAM\nand ERASE operations.\nBlocks that are locked can be protected further, or locked tight. When locked tight, the\ndevice’s blocks can no longer be locked or unlocked.\nWP# and Block Lock\nThe following is true when the block lock feature is enabled:\n• Holding WP# LOW locks all blocks, provided the blocks are not locked tight.\n• If WP# is held LOW to lock blocks, then returned to HIGH, a new UNLOCK command\nmust be issued to unlock blocks.\nUNLOCK (23h-24h)\nBy default at power-on, if LOCK is HIGH, all the blocks are locked and protected from\nPROGRAM and ERASE operations. The UNLOCK (23h) command is used to unlock a\nrange of blocks. Unlocked blocks have no protection and can be programmed or erased.\nThe UNLOCK command uses two registers, a lower boundary block address register and\nan upper boundary block address register, and the invert area bit to determine what\nrange of blocks are unlocked. When the invert area bit = 0, the range of blocks within\nthe lower and upper boundary address registers are unlocked. When the invert area bit\n= 1, the range of blocks outside the boundaries of the lower and upper boundary ad-\ndress registers are unlocked. The lower boundary block address must be less than the\nupper boundary block address. The figures below show examples of how the lower and\nupper boundary address registers work with the invert area bit.\nTo unlock a range of blocks, issue the UNLOCK (23h) command followed by the appro-\npriate address cycles that indicate the lower boundary block address. Then issue the\n24h command followed by the appropriate address cycles that indicate the upper boun-\ndary block address. The least significant page address bit, PA0, should be set to 1 if set-\nting the invert area bit; otherwise, it should be 0. The other page address bits should be\n0.\nOnly one range of blocks can be specified in the lower and upper boundary block ad-\ndress registers. If after unlocking a range of blocks the UNLOCK command is again is-\nsued, the new block address range determines which blocks are unlocked. The previous\nunlocked block address range is not retained.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nBlock Lock Feature\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

If portions of the device are unlocked using the UN-\nLOCK (23h) command, they can be locked again using the LOCK (2Ah) command. The\nLOCK command locks all of the blocks in the device.

The PROGRAM or ERASE operation does not complete. Any READ STATUS com-\nmand reports bit 7 as 0, indicating that the block is protected.\nThe LOCK (2Ah) command is disabled if LOCK is LOW at power-on or if the device is\nlocked tight.\nFigure 55: LOCK Operation\nLOCK commandCLE\nCE#\nWE#\nI/Ox 2AhMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nBlock Lock Feature\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

When this command is issued, the UN-\nLOCK (23h) and LOCK (2Ah) commands are disabled. This provides an additional level\nof protection against inadvertent PROGRAM and ERASE operations to locked blocks.\nTo implement LOCK TIGHT in all of the locked blocks in the device, verify that WP# is\nHIGH and then issue the LOCK TIGHT (2Ch) command.\nWhen a PROGRAM or ERASE operation is issued to a locked block that has also been\nlocked tight, R/B# goes LOW for tLBSY. The PROGRAM or ERASE operation does not\ncomplete. The READ STATUS (70h) command reports bit 7 as 0, indicating that the\nblock is protected. PROGRAM and ERASE operations complete successfully to blocks\nthat were not locked at the time the LOCK TIGHT command was issued.\nAfter the LOCK TIGHT command is issued, the command cannot be disabled via a soft-\nware command. Lock tight status can be disabled only by power cycling the device or\ntoggling WP#. When the lock tight status is disabled, all of the blocks become locked,\nthe same as if the LOCK (2Ah) command had been issued.\nThe LOCK TIGHT (2Ch) command is disabled if LOCK is LOW at power-on.\nFigure 56: LOCK TIGHT Operation\n \nLOCK TIGHT\ncommandLOCK\nWP#\nCLE\nCE#\nWE#\nI/Ox\nR/B#\nDon’t Care2ChMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nBlock Lock Feature\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nOne-Time Programmable (OTP) Operations\nThis Micron NAND Flash device offers a protected, one-time programmable NAND\nFlash memory area. Thirty full pages (2112 bytes per page) of OTP data are available on\nthe device, and the entire range is guaranteed to be good. The OTP area is accessible\nonly through the OTP commands. Customers can use the OTP area any way they\nchoose; typical uses include programming serial numbers or other data for permanent\nstorage.\nThe OTP area leaves the factory in an unwritten state (all bits are 1s). Programming or\npartial-page programming enables the user to program only 0 bits in the OTP area. The\nOTP area cannot be erased, whether it is protected or not. Protecting the OTP area pre-\nvents further programming of that area.\nMicron provides a unique way to program and verify data before permanently protect-\ning it and preventing future changes. The OTP area is only accessible while in OTP oper-\nation mode. To set the device to OTP operation mode, issue the SET FEATURE (EFh)\ncommand to feature address 90h and write 01h to P1, followed by three cycles of 00h to\nP2-P4. For parameters to enter OTP mode, see Features Operations.\nWhen the device is in OTP operation mode, all subsequent PAGE READ (00h-30h) and\nPROGRAM PAGE (80h-10h) commands are applied to the OTP area. The OTP area is as-\nsigned to page addresses 02h-1Fh. To program an OTP page, issue the PROGRAM PAGE\n(80h-10h) command. The pages must be programmed in the ascending order. Similarly,\nto read an OTP page, issue the PAGE READ (00h-30h) command.\nProtecting the OTP is done by entering OTP protect mode. To set the device to OTP pro-\ntect mode, issue the SET FEATURE (EFh) command to feature address 90h and write\n03h to P1, followed by three cycles of 00h to P2-P4.\nTo determine whether the device is busy during an OTP operation, either monitor R/B#\nor use the READ STATUS (70h) command.\nTo exit OTP operation or protect mode, write 00h to P1 at feature address 90h.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nOne-Time Programmable (OTP) Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nOTP DATA PROGRAM (80h-10h)\nThe OTP DATA PROGRAM (80h-10h) command is used to write data to the pages within\nthe OTP area. An entire page can be programmed at one time, or a page can be partially\nprogrammed up to eight times. Only the OTP area allows up to eight partial-page pro-\ngrams. The rest of the blocks support only four partial-page programs. There is no\nERASE operation for OTP pages.\nPROGRAM PAGE enables programming into an offset of an OTP page using two bytes of\nthe column address (CA[12:0]). The command is compatible with the RANDOM DATA\nINPUT (85h) command. The PROGRAM PAGE command will not execute if the OTP\narea has been protected.\nTo use the PROGRAM PAGE command, issue the 80h command. Issue n address cycles.\nThe first two address cycles are the column address. For the remaining cycles, select a\npage in the range of 02h-00h through 1Fh-00h. Next, write from 1–2112 bytes of data.\nAfter data input is complete, issue the 10h command. The internal control logic auto-\nmatically executes the proper programming algorithm and controls the necessary tim-\ning for programming and verification.\nR/B# goes LOW for the duration of the array programming time (tPROG). The READ\nSTATUS (70h) command is the only valid command for reading status in OTP operation\nmode. Bit 5 of the status register reflects the state of R/B#. When the device is ready,\nread bit 0 of the status register to determine whether the operation passed or failed (see\nStatus Operations). Each OTP page can be programmed to 8 partial-page programming.Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nOne-Time Programmable (OTP) Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

To protect the OTP area, the target must be in OTP opera-\ntion mode.\nTo protect all data in the OTP area, issue the 80h command. Issue n address cycles in-\ncluding the column address, OTP protect page address and block address; the column\nand block addresses are fixed to 0. Next, write 00h data for the first byte location and\nissue the 10h command. R/B# goes LOW for the duration of the array programming\ntime, tPROG.\nAfter the data is protected, it cannot be programmed further. When the OTP area is pro-\ntected, the pages within the area are no longer programmable and cannot be unprotec-\nted.\nThe READ STATUS (70h) command is the only valid command for reading status in OTP\noperation mode. The RDY bit of the status register will reflect the state of R/B#. Use of\nthe READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command is prohibited.\nWhen the target is ready, read the FAIL bit of the status register to determine if the oper-\nation passed or failed.\nIf the OTP DATA PROTECT (80h-10h) command is issued after the OTP area has already\nbeen protected, R/B# goes LOW for tOBSY.

Data can be read from OTP pages within the OTP area\nwhether the area is protected or not.\nTo use the PAGE READ command for reading data from the OTP area, issue the 00h\ncommand, and then issue five address cycles: for the first two cycles, the column ad-\ndress; and for the remaining address cycles, select a page in the range of 02h-00h-00h\nthrough 1Fh-00h-00h. Lastly, issue the 30h command. The PAGE READ CACHE MODE\ncommand is not supported on OTP pages.\nR/B# goes LOW (tR) while the data is moved from the OTP page to the data register. The\nREAD STATUS (70h) command is the only valid command for reading status in OTP op-\neration mode. Bit 5 of the status register reflects the state of R/B# (see Status Opera-\ntions).\nNormal READ operation timings apply to OTP read accesses. Additional pages within\nthe OTP area can be selected by repeating the OTP DATA READ command.\nThe PAGE READ command is compatible with the RANDOM DATA OUTPUT (05h-E0h)\ncommand.\nOnly data on the current page can be read.

Each\nplane contains a cache register and a data register independent of the other planes. The\nplanes are addressed via the low-order block address bits. Specific details are provided\nin Device and Array Organization.\nMulti-plane operations make better use of the NAND Flash arrays on these physical\nplanes by performing concurrent READ, PROGRAM, or ERASE operations on multiple\nplanes, significantly improving system performance. Multi-plane operations must be of\nthe same type across the planes; for example, it is not possible to perform a PROGRAM\noperation on one plane with an ERASE operation on another.\nWhen issuing MULTI-PLANE PROGRAM or ERASE operations, use the READ STATUS\n(70h) command and check whether the previous operation(s) failed. If the READ STA-\nTUS (70h) command indicates that an error occurred (FAIL = 1 and/or FAILC = 1), use\nthe READ STATUS ENHANCED (78h) command—time for each plane—to determine\nwhich plane operation failed.\nMulti-Plane Addressing\nMulti-plane commands require an address per operational plane. For a given multi-\nplane operation, these addresses are subject to the following requirements:\n• The LUN address bit(s) must be identical for all of the issued addresses.\n• The plane select bit, BA[6], must be different for each issued address.\nThe READ STATUS (70h) command should be used following MULTI-PLANE PROGRAM\nPAGE and ERASE BLOCK operations on a single die (LUN).Micron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nMulti-Plane Operations\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

All rights reserved.\nError Management\nEach NAND Flash die (LUN) is specified to have a minimum number of valid blocks\n(NVB) of the total available blocks. This means the die (LUNs) could have blocks that\nare invalid when shipped from the factory. An invalid block is one that contains at least\none page that has more bad bits than can be corrected by the minimum required ECC.\nAdditional blocks can develop with use. However, the total number of available blocks\nper die (LUN) will not fall below NVB during the endurance life of the product.\nAlthough NAND Flash memory devices could contain bad blocks, they can be used\nquite reliably in systems that provide bad block management and error-correction algo-\nrithms. This type of software environment ensures data integrity.\nInternal circuitry isolates each block from other blocks, so the presence of a bad block\ndoes not affect the operation of the rest of the NAND Flash array.\nNAND Flash devices are shipped from the factory erased. The factory identifies invalid\nblocks before shipping by attempting to program the bad block mark into every loca-\ntion in the first page of each invalid block. It may not be possible to program every loca-\ntion with the bad block mark. However, the first spare area location in each bad block is\nguaranteed to contain the bad block mark. This method is compliant with ONFI Factory\nDefect Mapping requirements. See the following table for the first spare area location\nand the bad block mark.\nSystem software should check the first spare area location on the first page of each\nblock prior to performing any PROGRAM or ERASE operations on the NAND Flash de-\nvice. A bad block table can then be created, enabling system software to map around\nthese areas. Factory testing is performed under worst-case conditions. Because invalid\nblocks could be marginal, it may not be possible to recover this information if the block\nis erased.\nOver time, some memory locations may fail to program or erase properly. In order to\nensure that data is stored properly over the life of the NAND Flash device, the following\nprecautions are required:\n• Always check status after a PROGRAM or ERASE operation\n• Under typical conditions, use the minimum required ECC (see table below)\n• Use bad block management and wear-leveling algorithms\nThe first block (physical block address 00h) for each CE# is guaranteed to be valid\nwith ECC when shipped from the factory.\nTable 18: Error Management Details\nDescription Requirement\nMinimum number of valid blocks (NVB) per LUN 1004\nTotal available blocks per LUN 1024\nFirst spare area location x8: byte 2048 x16: word 1024\nBad-block mark x8: 00h x16: 0000h\nMinimum required ECC 4-bit ECC per 528 bytes of data\nMinimum required ECC for block 0 if PROGRAM/\nERASE cycles are less than 10001-bit ECC per 528 bytesMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nError Management\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.

The host can\nselect a different drive strength setting using the SET FEATURES (EFh) command.\nThe output impedance range from minimum to maximum covers process, voltage, and\ntemperature variations. Devices are not guaranteed to be at the nominal line.\nTable 19: Output Drive Strength Conditions (V CCQ = 1.7–1.95V)\nRange Process Voltage Temperature\nMinimum Fast-Fast 1.95V TA (MIN)\nNominal Typical-Typical 1.8V +25°C\nMaximum Slow-Slow 1.7V TA (MAX)\nTable 20: Output Drive Strength Impedance Values (V CCQ = 1.7–1.95V)\nOutput\nStrength Rpd/Rpu VOUT to V SSQ Minimum Nominal Maximum Unit\nOverdrive 2 Rpd VCCQ × 0.2 7.5 13.5 34 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.5 9 18 31 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.8 11 23.5 44 ohms\nRpu VCCQ × 0.2 11 23.5 44 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.5 9 18 31 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.8 7.5 13.5 34 ohms\nOverdrive 1 Rpd VCCQ × 0.2 10.5 19 47 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.5 13 25 44 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.8 16 32.5 61.5 ohms\nRpu VCCQ × 0.2 16 32.5 61.5 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.5 13 25 44 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.8 10.5 19 47 ohms\nNominal Rpd VCCQ × 0.2 15 27 66.5 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.5 18 35 62.5 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.8 22 52 88 ohms\nRpu VCCQ × 0.2 22 52 88 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.5 18 35 62.5 ohms\nVCCQ × 0.8 15 27 66.5 ohmsMicron Confidential and Proprietary\n1Gb x8, x16: NAND Flash Memory\nOutput Drive Impedance\nPDF: 09005aef847d5585\nm68m_nonecc_embedded_it_ct.pdf - Rev.
