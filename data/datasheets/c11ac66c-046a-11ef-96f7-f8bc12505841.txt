It con -\nnects directly to UARTs and 5V RS232 systems. Interfacing to RS232C (±12V levels) requires a passive clamping circuit and one 5V to ±12V level translator. Internal timers relieve the host of the burden of generating the time -critical 1 -Wire communication waveforms. In contrast to the DS9097(E) where a full \ncharacter must be sent by the host for each 1 -Wire time slot, the DS2480B can translate each character DS2480B  \nSerial to 1 -Wire L ine Driver  19-5047; 4/15 \n1 \n2 \n3 \n4 8 \n7 \n6 \n5 GND  \n1-W \nNC \nVDD  RXD  \nTXD  \nPOL  \nVPP \n8-Pin SO (150 mil)  \n1-Wire and iButton are registered trademarks of  \nMaxim Integrated Products, Inc.  \nMaxim Integrated    1 \n   \nDS2480B  \ninto eight 1 -Wire time slots, thereby increasing the data throughput significantl y. In addition, the \nDS2480B can be set to communicate at four different data rates, including 115.2kbps, 57.6kbps, and \n19.2kbps, with 9.6kbps being the power -on default. Command codes received from the host’s crystal \ncontrolled UART serve as a reference to  continuously calibrate the on- chip timing generator. The \nDS2480B uses a unique protocol that merges data and control information without requiring control pins. This approach maintains compatibility to off -the-shelf serial to wireless converters, allowing  easy \nrealization of 1 -Wire media jumpers. The various control functions of the DS2480B are optimized for 1-\nWire networks and support the special needs of all current 1- Wire devices including EPROM -based add -\nonly memories, EEPROM devices, and 1- Wire thermo meters. See Application Note 192: Using the \nDS2480B Serial 1- Wire Driver for detailed software examples.  \n \nDETAILED PIN DESCRIPTION  \nPIN SYMBOL  DESCRIPTION  \n1 GND  Ground Pin.  Common ground reference and ground return for 1 -Wire bus  \n2 1-W 1-Wire Input/Output  Pin. 1-Wire bus with slew -rate-controlled pulldown, \nactive pullup, ability to switch in V PP to program EPROM, and ability to switch \nin V DD through a low -impedance path to program EEPROM, or perform a \ntemperature conversion.  \n3 N.C.  No Connection  \n4 VDD Power Input Pin. Power supply for the chip and 1 -Wire pullup voltage, 5V \n±10%, must always  be lower than or equal to V PP. VDD should be derived from \nVPP by a separate voltage regulator whenever possible.  \n5 VPP EPROM Programming Voltage. 12V supply input fo r EPROM programming. \nIf EPROM programming is not required, connect this pin directly to the system’s \n5V supply.  \n6 POL  RXD/TXD Polarity Select.  RXD/TXD polarity select; tied to GND for RS232 \n(12V or 5V) connection; tied to V DD for direct connection to UART  chip.  \n7 TXD  Serial Data from UART.  Data input from host (inverted or true); maximum \nvoltage swing -0.3V to V DD + 0.3V; for logic thresholds see DC specifications.  \n8 RXD Serial Data to UART.  Signal output to host; push -pull driver with CMOS \ncompatible le vels; for true ± 12V RS232 systems an external level translator must \nbe provided.  \n \nOVERVIEW  \nThe DS2480B directly interfaces a 5V serial communication port with its lines TXD (transmit) and RXD (receive) to a 1 -Wire bus. In addition the device performs a speed conversion allowing the data rate at the \ncommunication port to be different from the 1 -Wire data rate. Several parameters relating to the 1 -Wire \nport and its timing as well as the communication speed at both the port and the 1- Wire bus are \nconfigurable. The circuit t o achieve these functions is outlined in the block diagram (see Figure 1).  \n The device gets its input data from the serial communication port of the host computer through pin TXD. For compatibility with active -high as well as active- low systems, the incoming signal can be inverted by \nmeans of the polarity input POL. The polarity chosen by hard- wiring the logic level of this pin is also \nvalid for the output pin RXD. If for minimizing the interface hardware an asymmetry between RXD and TXD is desired, this ca n be achieved by setting the most significant bit of the speed control parameter to a \n1 (see Configuration Parameter Value Codes ). With the MS bit of the speed control set to 1, the polarity \nat TXD is still selected by the logic level at POL, but the polar ity at RXD will be the opposite of what the \nlogic level at POL specifies.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 2 \n \nDS2480B  \nAs data enters the core of the DS2480B’s logic circuitry, it is analyzed to separate data and command \nbytes and to calibrate the device’s timing generator. The timing generator controls all speed relations of the communication interface and the 1 -Wire bus as well as the waveforms on the 1 -Wire bus. \n Command bytes either affect the configuration setting or generate certain waveforms on the 1 -Wire bus. \nData bytes are simply translated by the protocol converter into the appropriate 1- Wire activities. Each \ndata byte generates a return byte from the 1 -Wire bus that is communicated back to the host through the \nRXD pin as soon as the activity on the 1- Wire bus is completed. \n The 1 -Wire drive r shapes the slopes of the 1- Wire waveforms, applies programming pulses or strong \npullup to 5V and reads the 1- Wire bus using a non- TTL threshold to maximize the noise margin for best \nperformance on large 1 -Wire networks.  \n \nFigure 1 . DS2480B BLOCK DIAGRAM  \n \nDEVICE OPERATION  \nThe DS2480B can be described as a complex state machine with two static and several dynamic states. Two device -internal flags as well as functions assigned to certain bit positions in the command codes \ndetermine the behavior of the chip, as shown in the state transition diagram (Figure 2). The DS2480B \nrequires and generates a communication protocol of 8 data bits per character, 1 stop bit and no parity. It is permissible to use 2 stop bits on the TXD line. However, the DS2480B only assert s a single stop bit on \nRXD.   \nWhen powering up, the DS2480B performs a master reset cycle and enters the Command Mode , which is one of the two \nstatic states. The device now expects to receive one 1 -Wire reset command on the TXD line sent by the host at a d ata rate of \n9600bps (see Communication Commands  section for details). This command byte is required solely for calibration of the baud \nrate timing generator the DS2480B and is not translated into any activity on the 1 -Wire bus. After this first command byte the \ndevice is ready to receive and execute any command as described later in this document. NOTE: Baud rate calibration is valid \nonly for the V DD operating voltage at which calibration is performed. Post- calibration changes in V DD by more than 5% may \ncause calibration error to exceed ± 5%. The DS2480B requires a 1 -Wire reset command sent by the host at a data rate of \n9600bps for calibration. Data rates of 115200bps or higher during calibration may put the DS2480B in an undefined state, \nrequiring a power -down reset to restore normal operation.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 3 \n \nDS2480B  \n \nFigure 2.

This may be necessary if the host for \nany reason has lost synchronization with the device. The  DS2480B will perform a master reset cycle \nequivalent to the power -on reset if it detects start polarity in place of the stop bit. The host has several \noptions to generate this condition. These include making the UART generate a break signal, sending a NUL L character at a data rate of 4800bps and sending any character with parity enabled and selecting \nspace polarity for the parity bit. As with the power -on reset, the DS2480B requires a 1- Wire reset \ncommand sent by the host at a data rate of 9600bps for cali bration. \n After the DS2480B has reached the Command Mode, the host can send commands such as 1- Wire Reset, \nPulse, Configuration, Search Accelerator, and Single Bit functions or switch over to the second static state called Data Mode . In Data Mode the DS248 0B simply converts bytes it receives at the TXD pin \ninto their equivalent 1- Wire waveforms and reports the results back to the host through the RXD pin. If \nthe Search Accelerator is on, each byte seen at TXD will generate a 12 -bit sequence on the 1- Wire bu s \n(see Search Accelerator  section for details). If the strong pullup to 5V is enabled (see Pulse Command), \neach byte on the 1 -Wire bus will be followed by a pause of predefined duration where the bus is pulled to \n5V via a low -impedance transistor in the 1 -Wire driver circuit.  \n While being in the Data Mode the DS2480B checks each byte received from the host for the reserved code that is used to switch back to Command Mode. To be able to write any possible code (including the reserved one) to the 1 -Wire bus, the transition to the Command Mode is as follows: After having received \nthe code for switching to Command Mode, the device temporarily enters the Check Mode where it waits \nfor the next byte. If both bytes are the same, the byte is sent once to the 1- Wire b us and the device returns \nto the Data Mode. If the second byte is different from the reserved code, it will be executed as command and the device finally enters the Command Mode. As a consequence, if the reserved code that normally switches to Command Mode  is to be written to the 1 -Wire bus, this code byte must be sent twice \n(duplicated). This detail must be considered carefully when developing software drivers for the DS2480B.  \n After having completed a memory function with a device on the 1- Wire bus it is recommended to issue a \nReset Pulse. This means that the DS2480B has to be switched to Command Mode. The host then sends the appropriate command code and continues performing other tasks. If during this time a device arrives at the 1 -Wire bus it will genera te a presence pulse. The DS2480B will recognize this unsolicited presence \npulse and notify the host by sending a byte such as XXXXXX01b. The Xs represent undefined bit values. The fact that the host receives the byte unsolicited together with the pattern 0 1b in the least significant 2 \nbits marks the bus arrival. If the DS2480B is left in Data Mode after completing a memory function command it will not report any bus arrival to the host.  \n \nCOMMAND CODE OVERVIEW  \nThe DS2480B is controlled by a variety of commands. All command codes are 8 bits long. The most significant bit of each command code distinguishes between communication and configuration commands. Configuration commands access the configuration registers. They can write or read any of the configurable p arameters. Communication commands use data of the configuration register in order to \ngenerate activity on the 1 -Wire bus and/or (dis)arm the strong pullup after every byte or (de)activate the \nSearch Accelerator without generating activity on the 1 -Wire bus . Details on the command codes are \nincluded in the State Transition diagram (Figure 2). A full explanation is given in the subsequent Communication Commands  and Configuration Commands  sections.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 5 \n \nDS2480B  \nIn addition to the command codes explained in the subsequent sections the DS2480B understands the \nfollowing reserved command codes:  \n \nE1h switch to Data Mode  \nE3h switch to Command Mode  \nF1h pulse termination  \n \nExcept for these reserved commands, the Search Accelerator control and the first byte after power -on \nreset or master reset cycle, every legal command byte generates a response byte. The pulse termination code triggers the response byte of the terminated pulse command. Illegal command bytes do not generate a command response byte.  \n  \nCOMMUNICATION COMMANDS  \nThe DS2480B supports four communication function commands: Reset, Single Bit, Pulse, and Search Accelerator control. Details on the assignment of each bit of the command codes are shown in Table 1. The corresponding command response bytes are detailed in Table 2. T he Reset, Search Accelerator \nControl and Single Bit commands include bits to select the 1 -Wire communication speed (standard, \nflexible, Overdrive). Even if a command does not generate activity on the 1- Wire bus, these bits are \nlatched inside the device and  will take effect immediately.  \n \nReset  \nThe Reset command must be used to begin all 1 -Wire communication. The speed selection included in \nthe command code immediately takes effect. The response byte includes a code for the reaction on the  \n1-Wire bus (bits 0 and 1) and a code for the chip revision (bits 2 to 4).  \n \nSingle Bit  \nThe Single Bit command is used to generate a single time slot on the 1 -Wire bus at the speed indicated by \nbits 2 and 3. The type of the time slot (Write -0 or Write -1) is determined by the  logic value of bit 4. A \nRead Data time slot is identical to the Write -1 time slot. Bits 0 and 1 of the response byte transmitted by \nthe DS2480B at the end of the time slot reveal the value found on the 1- Wire bus when reading.  \n For a time slot without a s ubsequent strong pullup, bit 1 of the command must be set to 0. For a time slot \nimmediately followed by a strong pullup bit 1 must be set to 1. As soon as the strong pullup is over, the device will send a second response byte, code EFh (read 1) or ECh (rea d 0), depending on the value \nfound on the 1- Wire bus when reading.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 6 \n \nDS2480B  \nTable 1.

In previous data sheet versions this bit was used to indicate that a programming voltage w as present.  \n \nSearch Accelerator Control  \nThe Search Accelerator Control command is used to set or reset the Search Accelerator control flag. Bit 4 of the command code contains the state to which the accelerator control flag is to be set. If the flag is set to a 1 (on) the device translates every byte received in Data Mode into a 12 -bit sequence on the 1 -Wire \nbus. For details on how the Search Accelerator works please refer to the section Search Accelerator Operation. Before activating the Search Accelerator,  one must make sure that the strong pullup after \nevery byte is disarmed (see Pulse Command). The Search Accelerator command does not generate a command response byte.  \n Although the Search Accelerator Control command itself does not generate any 1 -Wire acti vity, it can be \nused to select the communication speed on the 1- Wire bus. The speed selection (if different from the \nprevious setting, e.g., from a Reset command) will take effect immediately.  \n \nPulse  \nThe Pulse command serves several functions that are sele cted by the contents of bit 1 and bit 4 of the \ncommand code. The main functions are generating a strong pullup to 5V and generating 12V programming pulses for EPROM devices (if the 12V are available at the V\nPP pin). The secondary function \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 7 \n \nDS2480B  \nof the pulse comm and is arming and disarming a strong pullup after every subsequent byte in Data Mode. \nThe arm/disarm function is controlled by bit 1 of the command code. Bit 4 determines whether the device \nwill generate a strong pullup to 5V or a 12V programming pulse. Th e table below summarizes these \noptions.  \nBIT 4  BIT 1  FUNCTION  \n0 0 Strong pullup to 5V and disarm  \n1 0 12V programming pulse and disarm  \n0 1 Strong pullup to 5V and arm  \n1 1 12V programming pulse and arm  \n The strong pullup to 5V is required to program EEP ROM devices or to operate special function devices \nthat require a higher current for a limited time after having received a “go and convert” command. Therefore, and because it significantly reduces the effective data throughput on the 1 -Wire bus, the strong \npullup is disarmed most of the time. Although arming or disarming is simultaneously possible while generating a programming pulse, this is not recommended since it is likely to destroy the DS2480B if non-EPROM devices are connected to the 1 -Wire bus. \n The duration of the strong pullup or programming pulse is determined by configuration parameters and \nranges from a few microseconds up to unlimited (see Configuration Commands section). However, unlim ited duration is not allowed in conjunction with arming t he strong pullup after every byte. As long \nas the DS2480B is in Command Mode the host may termi nate a strong pullup or programming pulse \nprema turely at any time by sending the command code F1h.  \n The response byte is generated as soon as the strong pullup or programming pulse is over (either because \nthe predefined time has elapsed, the high current demand is over, or due to termination by the host). The response byte mainly returns the com mand code as sent by the host, but the 2 least significant bits are  \nundefined.  \n If the strong pullup is armed and the device is in Data Mode, the end of the strong pullup will be signaled as code F6h if the most significant bit of the preceding data byte on the 1- Wire bus is a 1 and 76h \notherwise. The host will see this r esponse byte in addition to the response on the data byte sent (see also \nWaveforms  section later in this document). \n \nSEARCH ACCELERATOR INTRODUCTION \nThe Search Accelerator is a logic block inside the DS2480B that allows using the Search ROM function very e fficiently under modern operating systems. Without the DS2480B all 1- Wire port adapters have to \ninvolve the computer’s CPU for every single time slot or pulse to be generated on the 1- Wire bus. \n Under some operating systems it may take several milliseconds  or more to get the first time slot generated \non the 1- Wire bus when sending commands to the UART. Every subsequent time slot will be generated \nin much less time, since the computer simply sends out “streams” —a long chain of bytes. This works \nreasonably well when reading or writing large blocks of data.  \n Searching the 1 -Wire bus to identify all ROM IDs of the devices connected, however, requires reading 2 \nbits, making a decision and then writing a bit. This procedure is to be repeated 64 times to identify a nd \naddress a single device. With the overhead of modern operating systems this fairly simple process takes a lot of time, reducing the discovery rate of devices on the 1- Wire bus. To solve this problem the Search \nAccelerator was developed.  \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 8 \n \nDS2480B  \n \nDuring the exec ution of the Search ROM function, the Search Accelerator receives from the host \ninformation on the preferred path to choose as one contiguous chain of bytes and then translates it into the appropriate time slots on the 1 -Wire bus. In addition, the Search A ccelerator reports back to the host the \nROM ID of the device actually addressed and the bit positions in which conflicts were found. (If the ROM ID of one device has a 0 in a bit position where another device has a 1, this is called a “conflict” on the electrical level and “discrepancy” on the logical level. See Application Note 187 for a more detailed discussion of the Search ROM.) This helps the host to select the preferred path for the next Search ROM activity.  \n Since the ROM ID of all 1 -Wire/iButton dev ices is 64 bits long and a conflict may occur in any of these \nbits, the total length of data reported to the host is 128 bits or 16 bytes. To avoid data overrun (if the CPU sends data faster than it can be processed) the protocol for the Search Accelerator  operation was defined \nso that one has to send as many bytes as one will receive. This way the CPU sends 16 bytes for each path and the UART guarantees the correct data timing and frees the CPU for other tasks while the DS2480B performs a Search ROM functi on. \n \nSEARCH ACCELERATOR OPERATION \nAfter the Search Accelerator is activated and the Data Mode is selected, the host must send 16 bytes to complete a single Search ROM pass on the 1 -Wire bus. These bytes are constructed as follows:  \n first byte  \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nr3 x3 r2 x2 r1 x1 r0 x0 \net cetera  \n 16\nth byte  \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nr63 x63 r62 x62 r61 x61 r60 x60 \n In this scheme, the index (values from 0 to 63, “n”) designates the position of the bit in the ROM ID of a 1-Wire/iButton device. The character “x” marks b its that act as filler and do not require a specific value \n(“don’t care” bits). The character “r” marks the path to go at that particular bit in case of a conflict during the execution of the ROM Search.  \n For each bit position n (values from 0 to 63) the D S2480B will generate three time slots on the 1 -Wire \nbus. These are referenced as:  \n b0 for the first time slot (Read Data)  \nb1 for the second time slot (Read Data) and  \nb2 for the third time slot (Write Data).  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ............................................................................................................................................................................................. 9 \n \nDS2480B  \nThe type of time slot b2 (write 1 or write 0) is  determined by the DS2480B as follows:  \nb2 = rn if conflict (as chosen by the host)  \n= b 0 if no conflict (there is no alternative)  \n= 1 if error (there is no response)  \n \nThe response the host will receive during a complete pass through a Search ROM function us ing the \nSearch Accelerator consists of 16 bytes as follows:  \n first byte  \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nr’3 d3 r’2 d2 r’1 d1 r’0 d0 \net cetera  \n 16\nth byte  \n7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 \nr’63 d63 r’62 d62 r’61 d61 r’60 d60 \n As before, the index (values from 0 to 63, “n”) designates the  position of the bit in the ROM ID of a \n1-Wire/iButton device. The character “d” marks the discrepancy flag in that particular bit position. The \ndiscrepancy flag will be 1 if there is a conflict, or no response in that particular bit position, and 0 otherw ise. The character “r” marks the actually chosen path at that particular bit position. The chosen \npath is identical to b2 for the particular bit position of the ROM ID.  \n To perform a Search ROM sequence one starts with all bits r\nn being 0s. In case of a bus error, all \nsubsequent response bits r’ n are 1s until the Search Accelerator is deactivated. Thus, if r’ 63 and d 63 are both \n1, an error has occurred during the search procedure and the last sequence has to be repeated. Otherwise r’\nn (n = 0 ... 63) is the ROM code of the device that has been found and addressed.  \n For the next Search ROM sequence one reuses the previous set r\nn (n = 0 ... 63) but sets r m to 1 with “m” \nbeing the index number of the highest discrepancy flag (that is, 1) and sets all r i to 0 wit h i > m. This \nprocess is repeated until the highest discrepancy occurs in the same bit position for two consecutive \npasses.  \n \nThe table below shows an example for the communication between host and DS2480B to perform one pass through the Search ROM function using the Search Accelerator. After a device has been identified \nand addressed, a memory function (not specified here) is executed and finally a reset pulse is generated. This example assumes that the DS2480B was in Command Mode and that standard 1- Wire s peed is used. \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 10 \n \nDS2480B  \nSearch Accelerator Usage Example  \nAction Sequence  Host TX  Host RX  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nSearch ROM command  F0 (as sent)  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nSearch Accelerator On  B1 (nothing)  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nSend 16 bytes  data (response)  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nSearch Accelerator Off  A1 (nothing)  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nDo Memory Function    \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \n \nCONFIGURATION COMMANDS  \nThe DS2480B is designed to be configurable for the varying requirements of its application.

These settings will work on a short 1- Wire b us and assume standard 1- Wire communication speed. \nTo change these default settings and to verify the current settings, the logic of the DS2480B supports \nconfiguration commands. A summary of the available configuration parameters, their default settings at  \nstandard and Overdrive speed and their applicability is shown in Table 3.  \n Parameters not related to the communication speed on the 1 -Wire bus specify the duration of the 12V \nprogramming pulse, the duration of the strong pullup to 5V, and the baud rate on the interface that \nconnects the DS2480B to the host. The remaining three parameters are used to modify the 1- Wire \ncommunication waveforms if one selects “Flexible Speed” (see Communication Com mands  for speed \nselection).  \n Flexible speed is implemented to improve the perfor mance of large 1 -Wire Networks. This is \naccomplished by:  \n \uf0a7 limiting the slew rate on falling edges (e. g., at the beginning of time slots, to reduce ringing),  \n\uf0a7 extending the Write -1 low time (allows the current flow through the network to end slowly, to prevent \nvoltage spikes from inductive kickback),  \n\uf0a7 delaying the time point when reading a bit from the 1- Wire bus (gives the network more time to \nstabilize, to get a higher voltage margin) and  \n\uf0a7 adding extra recovery time between Write- 0 time slots (allows more energy transfer through the \nnetwork, to replenish the parasite power supply of the devices on the bus).  \n The latter two functions are controlled by a single parameter. Taking advantage of flexible speed requires \nchanging one or more of the se parameters from their default values. Otherwise the waveforms will be \nidentical to those at standard speed.  \n Each configuration parameter is identified by its 3 -bit parameter code and can be programmed for one of \na maximum eight different values using a  3-bit value code. A matrix of parameter codes and value codes \nwith the associated physical values in shown in Table 4. \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 11 \n \nDS2480B  \n \nTable 3.

They may vary \nto some extent and are almost independent of the load on the 1- Wire bus. Information on how to select \nthe optimum value of this parameter is given in the Controlled Edges  section .  \n \nFor the parameters 010 (Programming Pulse Duration) and 011 (Strong Pullup Duration) one may select \nindefinite duration. This value, however, should only be selected if one is not going to switch the device to Data Mode. As long as the device stays in Command Mode, any pulse function (programming or strong pullup) that uses one of these parameters can be terminated by sending the command code F1h. \nTermination is not possible if the device is in Data Mode.  \n \nParameter 111 (RS232 Baud Rate) has two functions. It selects the baud rate and allows inversion of the \nsignal at the RXD pin. Using one of the value codes 100 to 111 will set the polarity at RXD to the \nopposite of what is defi ned by the logic level at the POL pin (asymmetry bit, see Figure 1). This may \nreduce the component count in some applications of the device. Note that when changing the baud rate, the DS2480B will send the command response byte at the new data rate.  \n \nA sho rt explanation on the use of parameters 100 (Write -1 Low Time) and 101 (Data Sample \nOffset/Write -0 Recovery Time) is given in the Timing Diagrams  section later in this document.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 12 \n \nDS2480B  \nTable 4.

Each 8- bit code word contains a 3- bit parameter \ncode to specify the parameter and the 3 -bit value code to be selected. Bit 7 of the command code is set to \n0 and bit 0 is always a 1. To read the value code of a parameter, one writ es all 0s for the parameter code \nand puts the parameter code in place of the parameter value code. Table 5 shows the details.  \n The configuration command response byte is similar to the command byte itself. Bit 0 of the response byte is always 0. When writing a parameter, the upper 7 bits are the echo of the command code. When reading a parameter, the current value code is returned in bit positions 1 to 3 with the upper 4 bits being \nthe same as sent (see Table 6).  \n \nTable 5.

The circuitry for shaping rising edges is always on. The slew rate of falling edges is actively \ncontrolled only at flexible speed and requires the parameter for slew rate control being different from its power -on default value.  \n \nAll Rising Edges  \nThe active pullup of the rising edges reduces the rise time on the 1 -Wire bus significantly compared to a \nsimple resistive pullup. Figure 4 shows how the DS2480B is involved in shaping a rising edge.  \n \nFigure 4 . ACTIVE PULLUP  \n The circuit operates as follows: At t\n1 the pulldown (induced by the DS2480B or a device on the bus) ends. \nFrom this point on the 1- Wire bus is pulled high by the weak pullup current I WEAKPU  provided by the \nDS2480B. The slope is determined by the load on the bus and the value of the pullup current. At t 2 the \nvoltage crosses the threshold voltage V IAPO. Now the DS2480B switches over from the weak pullup \ncurrent I WEAKPU  to the higher current I ACTPU . As a consequence, the voltage on the bus now rises faster. As \nthe voltage on the bus crosses the threshold V IAPTO  at t 3, a timer is started. As long as this timer is on \n(tAPUOT ), the I ACTPU  current will continue to flow. After the timer is expired, the DS2480B will switch \nback to the weak pullup current. Excessive noise on the 1- Wire line at the V IAPTO level can cause an \nundesirable trip of the active pullup. External R -C filtering as discussed in the HARDWARE \nAPPLICATION EXAMPLES  section and Application Note 148 should be use d to prevent false triggering.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 14 \n \nDS2480B  \nFalling Edges (DS2480B-initiated)  \nWhenever the DS2480B begins pulling the 1- Wire bus low to initiate a time slot, for example, it first \nturns off the weak pullup current I WEAKPU . Then, at standard and Overdrive speeds it wil l generate a \nfalling edge at a slew rate of typically 15V/ µs. This value is acceptable for short 1 -Wire busses and \nadequate for communication at Overdrive speed. For 1- Wire networks of more than roughly 30m length \none should always use flexible speed. One of the parameters that is adjustable at flexible speed is the slew \nrate of DS2480B -initiated falling edges. The effect of the slew rate control is shown in Figure 5.  \n \nFigure 5 . SLEW RATE CONTROL  \n As extensive tests have shown, 1- Wire networks at a length of up to 300m will perform best if the fall \ntime t\nF is in the range of 4 ± 0.5µs. This translates into a slew rate of approximately 1V/ µs. This slew rate \nis typically achieved by setting the configuration parameter 001 (Pulldown Slew Rate Control) to a value of 100 (see Table 4). If the actual measured fall time is longer than the target value, one should use a value code of 011 or lower. If the fall time is shorter, one should use a value code of 101 or higher.  \n Once determined, the value code for the Pulldown Slew Rate Control parameter should be stored in the host and always be loaded into the DS2480B after a power -on or master reset cycle.  \n \nTIMING DIAGRAMS  \nThis section explains the waveforms generated by the DS2480B on the 1- Wire bus in detail. First the \ncommunication waveforms such as the Reset/Presence Detect Sequence and t he time slots are discussed. \nAfter that follows a detailed description of the pulse function under various conditions.   \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 15 \n \nDS2480B  \n1-WIRE COMMUNICATION WAVEFORMS  \nOne of the major features of the DS2480B is that it relieves the host from generating the timing of the  \n1-Wire signals and sampling the 1 -Wire bus at the appropriate times. How this is done for the \nreset/presence detect sequence is shown in Figure 6a. This sequence is composed of four timing \nsegments: the reset low time t RSTL, the short/interrupt sampling offset t SI, the presence detect sampling \noffset t PDT  and a delay time t FILL. The timing segments t SI, tPDT  and t FILL  comprise the reset high time t RSTH  \nwhere 1 -Wire slave devices assert their presence or interrupt pulse. During this time the DS2480B pulls \nthe 1-Wire bus high with its weak pullup current.  \n \nThe values of all timing segments for all 1 -Wire speed options are shown in the table. Since the \nreset/presence sequence is slow compared to the time slots, the values for standard and flexible speed are the same. Except for the falling edge of the presence pulse all edges are controlled by the DS2480B. The \nshape of the uncontrolled falling edge is determined by the capacitance of the 1- Wire bus and the number, \nspeed and sink capability of the slave devices connected.  \n \nFigure 6a. RESET/PRESENCE DETECT  \n \nSpeed  tRSTL tSI tPDT tFILL tRSTH \nStandard  512µs  8µs 64µs  512µs  584µs  \nOverdrive  64µs  2µs 8µs 64µs  74µs  \nFlexible  512µs  8µs 64µs  512µs  584µs  \n \nAfter having received the command code for generating a reset/presence sequence, the DS2480B pulls the 1 -Wire bus low for t\nRSTL  and then lets it go back to 5V. The DS2480B will now wait for the \nshort/interrupt sampling offset t SI to expire and then test the voltage on the 1- Wire bus to determine if \nthere is a short or a n interrupt signal. If there is no short or interrupt (as shown in the picture), the \nDS2480B will wait for t PDT  and test the voltage on the 1- Wire bus for a presence pulse. Regardless of the \nresult of the presence test, the DS2480B will then wait for t FILL  to expire and then send the command \nresponse byte to the host.  \n \nIf the test for interrupt or short reveals a logic 0, the DS2480B will wait for 4096 µs and then test the  \n1-Wire bus again. If a logic 0 is detected, the 1 -Wire bus is shorted and a command r esponse byte with \nthe code for SHORT will be sent immediately. If a logic 1 is detected, the device will wait for t FILL  to \nexpire, after which it will send the command response byte with the code for an alarming presence pulse. No additional testing for a presence pulse will be done. The DS2480B will perform the short/interrupt testing as described also at Overdrive speed, although interrupt signaling is only defined for standard speed.  \n \nThe idle time following the Reset/Presence Detect sequence depends on the serial communication speed and the host’s response time. \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 16 \n \nDS2480B  \nA Write -1 and Read Data time slot is comprised of the segments t LOW1, tDSO and t HIGH. During Write -1 \ntime slots, after the Write -1 low time t LOW1  is over, the DS2480B waits for the duration of the data sample \noffset and then samples the voltage at the 1 -Wire bus to read the response. After this, the waiting time \ntHIGH1  must expire before the time slot is complete. A Write -0 time slot only consists of the two segments \ntLOW0  and t REC0. \n \nIf the netwo rk is large or heavily loaded, one should select flexible speed and extend t LOW1 to more than \n8µs to allow the 1 -Wire bus to completely discharge. Since a large or heavily loaded network needs more \ntime to recharge, it is also recommended to delay sampling  the bus for reading. A higher value for t DSO  \nwill increase the voltage margin and also provide extra energy to the slave devices when generating a \nlong series of write 0 time slots. However, the total of t LOW1  + tDSO  should not exceed 22 µs*. Otherwise \nthe slave device responding may have stopped pulling the bus low when transmitting a logic 0.  \n \nThe idle time between time slots within a byte or during a 12 -bit sequence while the Search Accelerator is \non is 0. Between bytes, 12- bit search sequences and singl e bits the idle time depends on the RS232 data \nrate and the host’s response time. The response byte is sent to the host as soon as the last time slot of a \nbyte, 12- bit sequence or the command is completed. \n \nFigure 6b.

Therefore, \nthe timing generated by the DS2480B is in compliance with the requirement s of all 1 -Wire/iButton 1 -\nWire devices.  \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 17 \n \nDS2480B  \nPULSE WAVEFORMS, DISARMED  \nThe Pulse command can be used to generate a strong pullup to 5V and a 12V programming pulse, \nrespectively. The duration of the pulse is predefined if the parameter value code of parameter 01 0 \n(Programming Pulse Duration) has a value from 000 to 110, and parameter 011 (Strong Pullup Duration) has a value from 000 to 101 (see Table 4). Figures 7a and 7b show the timing of a pulse with predefined duration, which should be considered the normal c ase. If infinite duration is chosen (parameter value code \n111), the host must terminate the Pulse command, as shown in Figures 7c and 7d. All versions of Figure 7 assume that bit 1 of the pulse command is 0, i.e., disarmed mode. See the Communication Com mands:  \nPulse  section for more details on possibilities of the Pulse command. \n \nFigure 7a. STRONG PULLUP TO 5V, PREDEFINED DURATION  \n \nThe processing of a pulse command is essentially the same, regardless if a strong pullup or a programming pulse is requested. At t\n1 the host starts sending the pulse command byte. At t 2 the DS2480B \nhas received the command and immediately generates the pulse. The pulse ends at t 3 and the DS2480B \nsends out the command response byte to inform the host that the command is complete d. The idle time \nbetween t 1 and t 2 is determined by the time to transmit the command byte at the selected baud rate. The \nidle time between t 3 and t 4 is comprised of the time to transmit the response byte, plus the response time \nof the host plus the time to  transmit the command and/or data to generate the next time slot.  \n \nFigure 7b. 12V PROGRAMMING PULSE, PREDEFINED DURATION  \n \nA correct programming pulse can only be generated if the 12V programming voltage is available at the V\nPP pin of the DS2480B. The ris ing and falling edges of the programming pulse are actively controlled by \nDS2480B. The slew rate is approximately 14V/µs and meets the requirements of 1- Wire EPROM \ndevices.  \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 18 \n \nDS2480B  \nFor EPROM programming, only a single slave device should be connected to the 1- Wire bus and the \ncable must to be short, not to exceed a few meters. One should not attempt generating a programming \npulse with a non- EPROM device on the bus; this may damage the device as well as the DS2480B.  \n Certain applications may require a duration for a strong pullup or programming pulse that cannot be realized using one of the predefined values. Selecting infinite duration allows the host to generate pulses of any length. As a consequence, however, the host becomes responsible to actively control the duration of the pulse. Failing to do so may require a power -on reset or master reset cycle of the DS2480B. For this \nreason, infinite duration should only be used if absolutely necessary.  \n The time to end a pulse of infinite duration strongly depends on the baud rate of the communication between host and DS2480B. Neglecting the response time of the host, the minimum pulse durations are: 86.8µs at 115.2kbps, 173.6µs at 57.6kbps, 520µs at 19.2kbps, and 1.04ms at 9.6kbps.  \nFigure 7c. STRONG PULLUP TO 5V, INFINITE DURATION  \n \nAs before, processing the command is essentially the same, regardless if it is for a strong pullup or a \nprogramming pulse. At t 1 the host starts sending the Pulse command byte. At t 2 the DS2480B has \nreceived the command and immediately activa tes the strong pullup or switches in the 12V programming \nvoltage. To end the pulse, the DS2480B must receive a Termination command, code F1h, which occurs at t\n3. The Termination command does not generate a response byte. The DS2480B will immediately end the \npulse and send out the response byte of the pulse command. The idle time between t 1 and t 2 is determined \nby the time to transmit the command byte at the selected baud rate. The idle time between t 3 and t 4 is \ncomprised of the time to transmit the pulse re sponse byte, plus the response time of the host plus the time \nto transmit the command and/or data to generate the next time slot.  \n \nFigure 7d.  12V PROGRAMMING PULSE, INFINITE DURATION  \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 19 \n \nDS2480B  \nPULSE WAVEFORM, ARMED  \nAs explained in the Communication Commands  section, bit 1 of the Pulse command allows the arming of \na strong pullup to 5V if the bit is set to 1. If the strong pullup is armed and the device is switched to Data \nMode, there will be a strong pullup immediately following every byte on the 1- Wire bus. This mode is \nimplemented to provide extra energy when writing to EEPROM devices or to do a temperature conversion with the DS1920 temperature i Button, for example. These devices need a strong pullup \nimmediately after the power -consuming activity has been initia ted by a command code.  \n To arm the strong pullup, one usually generates a “dummy” pulse with bit 1 being 1 while the device is in Command Mode. To save time, the dummy pulse may immediately be terminated by sending the Termination command, code F1h. Then one switches to Data Mode and sends a command code that makes one or more slaves on the 1 -Wire bus require extra energy. After the command execution is \nfinished, one switches back to Command Mode and disarms the strong pullup by generating another dummy pul se. A complete temperature conversion sequence that shows the use of the armed pulse is \nincluded in the Software Driver Examples  section .  \n \nFigure 8. STRONG PULLUP TO 5V, ARMED, PREDEFINED DURATION  \n \nFigures 8 shows the timing of the strong pullup in Data  Mode. At t 1 the 8th time slot of the byte sent to the \n1-Wire bus is completed. Without any delay the DS2480B now activates the strong pullup and \nsimultaneously starts sending the data response byte to the host. At t 2 the strong pullup ends and the \nDS2480B  sends a pulse response byte to the host. The idle time between t 2 and t 3 is comprised of the time \nto transmit the pulse response byte, plus the response time of the host plus the time to transmit the command and/or data to generate the next time slot. Sin ce in Data Mode the Pulse Termination command \nis not applicable, the duration of the strong pullup must be limited. See Table 4, parameter 011 (Strong Pullup Duration) for details.  \n Infinite duration, if accidentally selected, will require a power -on or ma ster reset cycle to get the \nDS2480B back to communicating with the host.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 20 \n \nDS2480B  \nSINGLE BIT WITH STRONG PULLUP  \nSimilar to the Pulse command, the Single Bit command also allows generating a strong pullup \nimmediately following a time slot. The strong pullup of the Single Bit command, however, is controlled directly by bit 1 of the command code and therefore needs not be armed. Since the DS2480B remains in Command Mode when using the Single Bit command, any duration of the strong pullup including infinite may be selected.  \n \nFigure 9a. SINGLE BIT WITH STRONG PULLUP, PREDEFINED DURATION  \nFigure 9 shows the timing of the Single Bit command immediately following strong pullup. For \npredefined duration (Figure 9a) the timing is as follows: At t 1 the time slot is completed.  Now the \nDS2480B activates the strong pullup and simultaneously starts sending the response byte of the Single Bit \ncommand to the host. At t 2 the strong pullup ends and the DS2480B sends out a pulse response byte. The \nidle time between t 2 and t 3 is compris ed of the time to transmit the pulse response byte, plus the response \ntime of the host plus the time to transmit the command and/or data to generate the next time slot.  \n \nFigure 9b.  SINGLE BIT WITH STRONG PULLUP, INFINITE DURATION  \n \nFor infinite duration ( Figure 9b) the strong pullup also begins immediately after the time slot is \ncompleted. To end the strong pullup, the DS2480B must receive a Termination command, code F1h, \nwhich occurs at t2. The termination command does not generate a response byte. The DS 2480B will then \nimmediately end the strong pullup and send out a pulse response byte. Everything else is the same as with \npredefined duration.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 21 \n \nDS2480B  \nThe minimum duration of a strong pullup of infinite duration strongly depends on the baud rate of the \ncommunicat ion between host and DS2480B. The host must first receive the response byte of the Single \nBit command, react to it and then transmit the termination command. Neglecting the host’s response time, \nthe shortest duration of an infinite strong pullup therefore is 173.6 µs at 115.2kbps, 347.2 µs at 57.6kbps, \n1.04ms at 19.2kbps, and 2.08ms at 9.6kbps. \n \nSOFTWARE DRIVER EXAMPLES  \nThe DS2480B requires a software driver that translates the activities to be generated on the 1- Wire bus \ninto the appropriate commands. The ex amples below cover typical situations, such as reading the ROM, \nwriting to the scratchpad of a Memory i Button, reading the memory of a Memory i Button, programming \nan Add- Only iButton EPROM and performing a temperature conversion with the DS1920 temperature  \niButton. An example for the use of the Search Accelerator is included in the Search Accelerator section \nfound earlier in this document.  The DS2480B command codes used in these examples are valid for standard speed and will work properly on short 1- Wire b uses (<10m). The response byte on the reset command assumes a normal \npresence pulse, no alarm or short.  The DS2480B includes a 1- byte buffer that stores a byte received from the host while the previous byte is \nbeing translated into activity on the 1- Wire bus. For this reason the host may send another byte even \nwithout having received the response byte. Sending bytes faster than they can be translated into 1 -Wire \nactivities may result in loss of data and/or synchronization and therefore should be avoided.  \n \nREAD ROM SEQUENCE  \nAction Sequence  Host TX  Host RX  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nRead ROM Command  33 (as sent)  \nRead ROM ID (8 bytes)  FF (x8)  ROM ID  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \n \nWRITE SCRATCHPAD SEQUENCE  \nWrite 2 bytes to scratchpad at memory locations 16h and 17h \nAction Sequence  Host TX  Host RX  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nSkip ROM Command  CC CC \nWrite Scratchpad Command  0F (as sent)  \nStarting Address TA1  16 (as sent)  \nStarting Address TA2  00 (as sent)  \nWrite to the Scratchpad  (2 bytes)  (as sent)  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 22 \n \nDS2480B  \nREAD MEMORY SEQUENCE  \nAction Sequence  Host TX  Host RX  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nSet Dat a Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nSkip ROM Command  CC CC \nRead Memory Command  F0 (as sent)  \nStarting Address TA1  40 (as sent)  \nStarting Address TA2  00 (as sent)  \nRead 8 Bytes of Data  FF (x8)  (data)  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \n \nWRITE EPROM SEQUENCE (DS2505) \nWrite memory starting at address 40h  \nAction Sequence  Host TX  Host RX  \nSet Vpp dur. = 512µs  29 28 \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nSkip ROM Command  CC (as sent)  \nWrite Memory Command  0F (as sent)  \nStarting Address TA1  40 (as sent)  \nStarting Address TA2  00 (as sent)  \n*** Send Data Byte  (data)  (as sent)  \nReceive CRC16  FF (x2)  CRC16  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nGenerate Program Pulse  FD response  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nRead Written Byte  FF (data)  \nGo to *** to write the next byte or end the sequence as shown below  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \n \nTEMPERATURE CONVERSION SEQUENCE \nAction Sequence  Host TX  Host RX  \nSet pullup dur. = 524ms  39 38 \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nSkip ROM Command  CC (as sent)  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nArm Strong Pullup  EF (nothing)  \nTerminate Pulse  F1 response  \nSet Data Mode  E1 (nothing)  \nConvert Temperature  44 (as sent)  \nWait for Pulse Response  (nothing)  response  \nSet Command Mode  E3 (nothing)  \nDisarm Strong Pullup  ED (nothing)  \nTerminate Pulse  F1 response  \nGenerate Reset Pulse  C1 CD or ED  \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 23 \n \nDS2480B  \nHARDWARE APPLICATION EXAMPLES  \nThis section discusses five typical application scenarios. The DS2480B can be configure d for EPROM \nprogramming as well as for 5V operation only.  \n \nOUTPUT FILTERING  \nAs described in the CONTROLLED EDGES  section, the DS2480B employs an active pullup on the rising \nedges of the 1 -Wire waveform.  \n \nExcessive noise on the 1- Wire line in the region of  the pullup trip voltage, V IAPTO, can cause an \nundesirable trip of the active pullup, which can disrupt 1- Wire communication. External R -C filtering as \nshown in Figure 10 should be added to all DS2480B configurations with the exception of those that perform EPROM programming.  \n For EPROM programming configurations the R -C filter cannot be used due to the voltage drop that will \ndevelop across the 100Ω resistor during programming.  \n \nFigure 10.

For 5V operation a single device is \nsufficient. For EPROM programming two DS950x devices must be connected in series to achieve a high \nenough breakdown voltage.  \n Figures 11a -c are examples of connecting the DS2480B directly to a UART or RS232C interface. The  \ncircuit becomes more complex if a 1 -Wire bus is to be interfaced to a port that provides and expects \ninverted signals, but does not necessarily meet the RS232C ( ±12V) standard (Figure 11b).  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 24 \n \nDS2480B  \nFigure 11a.

The resistor in the TXD line and \nthe Schottky di ode limit the negative voltage at the TXD pin of the DS2480B to 0.3V maximum. The \nresistor is typically 4.7k Ω. If the inverting driver is current -limited to 1mA the resistor is not required.  \n \nFrom the DS2480B’s perspective, this circuit will work with inve rted signals of ± 5V as well as 0 to 5V. \nDepending on the voltage levels the host expects, it may be necessary to generate a negative voltage on \nthe RXD line. Figure 11c shows how this can be accomplished for a true RS232C system.  \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 25 \n \nDS2480B  \nFigure 11c. ±12V RS232  \n \n \nSIN \n(RXD)  \nSOUT \n(TXD)  UART  \nor µC  \nStart Stop 1 \n0 L M 1-Wire Bus  \nReturn  DTR Power Stealing  \nGND 1-W POL VPP \nVDD \nRXD \nTXD DS2480B  RTS \nSee Text  2.7K  \n4.7V  5V \nRegulator  \n6.8K  \n1 µf BSS110  S \nD +12VDC Programming  \n* \n* only one DS950x ESD protection device with 5V  DS9503  \nDS9503  \n \n \nIn the interface to a true RS232C system ( ±12V, Figure 11c) the power for the DS2480B is stolen from \nDTR and RTS. The software must make sure that at least one of these signals constantly provides the 12V operating voltage. The 6.8kΩ resistor and the 4.7V Zener diode in the TXD line limit the positive voltage \nat the TXD pin of the DS2480B. The Schottky diode limits the negative voltage to 0.3V maximum. The \nSchottky diode in series with capacitor forms a parasitic supply to gene rate the negative bias for the \nhost’s receive channel. The positive signal is switched in through the P -channel MOSFET that connects \nto the RXD output of the DS2480B. In this circuit diagram the MOSFET switches the RXD line to +5V, which normally is suffic ient for RS232C systems.  \n Switching to 12V is also possible, but requires a P -channel transistor with a different threshold voltage. \nThe signal inversion caused by the transistor is compensated through the DS2480B by using a value code of 100, 101, 110, or  111 for the RS232 baud rate setting.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 26 \n \nDS2480B  \nFigure 11d.

The energy to power \nthe LED in the TXD channel and to provide the positive voltage for the host’s RXD input is stolen from DTR and RTS. The negative voltage for the RXD input is taken from the TXD line through a parasitic supply consisting of a Schottky diode in series with a capacitor. The HCPL -2202 opto- isolator has a \ntotem pole output that allows switching in positive as well as negative voltage. The +5V are sufficient for most RS232C syste ms. Switching in 12V requires an opto- isolator with different voltage characteristics.  \n In the schematic the HCPL -2202 opto- isolator is sourced by the RXD pin of the DS2480B. It can as well \nbe connected the traditional way where the DS2480B sinks the curre nt through the LED. This, however, \ncauses a signal inversion that has to be compensated through the DS2480B by using a value code of 100, 101, 110, or 111 for the RS232 baud rate setting. Using other types of opto- isolators than shown in the \nschematic will at least require changing the values of the resistors.  \n \nMaxim Integrated  ........................................................................................................................................................................................... 27 \n \nDS2480B  \nFigure 12 .
