Please consult the approval sheet before ordering.Please read rating and Cautions first.  \n \nCaution\n■Storage and Operation Conditions\n1.The performance of chip monolithic ceramic capacitors may be affected by the storage conditions.\n1-1. Store the capacitors in the following conditions:Room Temperature of +5°C to +40°C and a Relative Humidity  \nof 20% to 70%.\n(1)Sunlight, dust, rapid temperature changes, corrosive gas atmosphere, or high temperature and humidity \nconditions during storage may affect solderability and packaging performance. Therefore, please maintain \nthe storage temperature and humidity. Use the product within six months, as prolonged storage may cause \noxidation of the electrodes.\n(2)Please confirm solderability before using after six months. Store the capacitors without opening the original bag. \nEven if the storage period is short, do not exceed the specified atmospheric conditions. \n1-2. Corrosive gas can react with the termination(external) electrodes or lead wires of capacitors, and result\nin poor solderability. Do not store the capacitors in an atmosphere consisting of corrosive gas\n(e.g., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia gas, etc.).  \n1-3. Due to moisture condensation caused by rapid humidity changes, or the photochemical change caused\nby direct sunlight on the terminal electrodes and/or the resin/epoxy coatings, the solderability and electrical \nperformance may deteriorate. Do not store capacitors under direct sunlight or in high humidity conditions. \n■Rating\n1.Temperature Dependent Characteristics\n1.The electrical characteristics of a capacitor can change with temperature.\n1-1. For capacitors having larger temperature dependency, the capacitance may change with temperature changes.\nThe following actions are recommended in order to ensure suitable capacitance values. \n(1)Select a suitable capacitance for the operating temperature range. \n(2)The capacitance may change within the rated temperature. When you use a high dielectric constant type \ncapacitor in a circuit that needs a tight (narrow) capacitance tolerance (e.g., a time-constant circuit), \nplease carefully consider the temperature characteristics, and carefully confirm the various characteristics\nin actual use conditions and the actual system. \n2.Measurement of Capacitance\n1.Measure capacitance with the voltage and frequency specified in the product specifications. \n1-1. The output voltage of the measuring equipment may decrease occasionally when capacitance is high.\nPlease confirm whether a prescribed measured voltage is impressed to the capacitor. \n1-2. The capacitance values of high dielectric constant type capacitors change depending on the AC voltage applied.\nPlease consider the AC voltage characteristics when selecting a capacitor to be used in an AC circuit. \n3.Applied Voltage\n1.Do not apply a voltage to the capacitor that exceeds the rated voltage as called out in the specifications.\n1-1. Applied voltage between the terminals of a capacitor shall be less than or equal to the rated voltage.\n(1)When AC voltage is superimposed on DC voltage, the zero-to-peak voltage shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\nWhen AC voltage or pulse voltage is applied, the peak-to-peak voltage shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\n(2)Abnormal voltages (surge voltage, static electricity, pulse voltage, etc.) shall not exceed the rated DC voltage.\nTypical Voltage Applied to the DC Capacitor\n(E: Maximum possible applied voltage.)\n1-2. Influence of over voltage\nOver voltage that is applied to the capacitor may result in an electrical short circuit caused by the breakdown\nof the internal dielectric layers. The time duration until breakdown depends on the applied voltage\nand the ambient temperature.\n2.Use a safety standard certified capacitor in a power supply input circuit (AC filter), as it is also necessary \n to consider the withstand voltage and impulse withstand voltage defined for each device.DC Voltage DC Voltage+AC AC Voltage Pulse Voltage\nE\n0\nE\n0\nE 0\nE\n0\nE\n0\nE\n0\nE 0\nE\n0\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n1 / 21\nCaution\n4.Type of Applied Voltage and Self-heating Temperature\n1.Confirm the operating conditions to make sure that no large current is flowing into the capacitor due to the continuous\napplication of an AC voltage or pulse voltage. When a DC rated voltage product is used in an AC voltage circuit or a\npulse voltage circuit, the AC current or pulse current will flow into the capacitor; therefore check the self-heating condition.\nPlease confirm the surface temperature of the capacitor so that the temperature remains within the upper limits of the\noperating temperature, including the rise in temperature due to self-heating. When the capacitor is used with a\nhigh-frequency voltage or pulse voltage, heat may be generated by dielectric loss.\n<Applicable to Rated Voltage of less than DC100V>\n1-1. The load should be contained to the level such that when measuring at atmospheric temperature of 25 ℃, the product's\nself-heating remains below 20 ℃ and the surface temperature of the capacitor in the actual circuit remains within the\nmaximum operating temperature.\n<Applicable to Temperature Characteristic X7R, X7T beyond Rated Voltage of DC200V>\n1-2. The load should be contained so that the self-heating of the capacitor body remains below 20°C, when measuring at\nan ambient temperature of 25°C. In addition, use a K thermocouple of φ0.1mm with less heat capacity when\nmeasuring, and measure in a condition where there is no effect from the radiant heat of other components or air flow\ncaused by convection. Excessive generation of heat may cause deterioration of the characteristics and reliability of the\ncapacitor. (Absolutely do not perform measurements while the cooling fan is operating, as an accurate measurement\nmay not be performed.)\n5.DC Voltage and AC Voltage Characteristics\n1.The capacitance value of a high dielectric constant type capacitor changes depending on the DC voltage applied.\nPlease consider the DC voltage characteristics when a capacitor is selected for use in a DC circuit.\n1-1. The capacitance of ceramic capacitors may change sharply depending on the applied voltage (see figure).\nPlease confirm the following in order to secure the capacitance.\n(1)Determine whether the capacitance change caused by the applied voltage is within the allowed range.\n(2)In the DC voltage characteristics, the rate of capacitance change becomes larger as voltage increases, even if the\napplied voltage is below the rated voltage. When a high dielectric constant type capacitor is used in a circuit that\nrequires a tight  (narrow) capacitance tolerance (e.g., a time constant circuit), please carefully consider the voltage\ncharacteristics, and confirm the various characteristics in actual operating conditions in an actual system.\n2.The capacitance values of high dielectric constant type capacitors changes depending on the AC voltage applied.\nPlease consider the AC voltage characteristics when selecting a capacitor to be used in an AC circuit.\n6.Capacitance Aging\n1.The high dielectric constant type capacitors have the characteristic in which the capacitance value decreases with the\npassage of time. When you use high dielectric constant type capacitors in a circuit that needs a tight (narrow) capacitance\ntolerance (e.g., a time-constant circuit), please carefully consider the characteristics of these capacitors, such as their \naging, voltage, and temperature characteristics. In addition, check capacitors using your actual appliances at the intended\nenvironment and operating conditions.\n7.Vibration and Shock\n1.Please confirm the kind of vibration and/or shock, its condition, and any generation of resonance.\nPlease mount the capacitor so as not to generate resonance, and do not allow any impact on the terminals.\n2.Mechanical shock due to being dropped may cause damage or a crack in the dielectric material of the capacitor.\nDo not use a dropped capacitor because the quality and reliability may be deteriorated.\n3.When printed circuit boards are piled up or handled, the corner of another printed circuit board should not be allowed\nto hit the capacitor, in order to avoid a crack or other damage to the capacitor.\nCrack\nFloor\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n2 / 21\nCaution\n■Soldering and Mounting\n1.Mounting Position\n1.Confirm the best mounting position and direction that minimizes the stress imposed on the capacitor during flexing \nor bending the printed circuit board.\n1-1. Choose a mounting position that minimizes the stress imposed on the chip during flexing or bending of the board.\n[Component Direction]\nLocate chip horizontal to the direction in which stress acts.\n[Chip Mounting Close to Board Separation Point]\nIt is effective to implement the following measures, to reduce stress in separating the board. It is best to implement all\nof the following three measures; however, implement as many measures as possible to reduce stress.\n[Mounting Capacitors Near Screw Holes]\nWhen a capacitor is mounted near a screw hole, it may be affected by the board deflection that occurs during the\ntightening of the screw. Mount the capacitor in a position as far away from the screw holes as possible.\n2.Information before Mounting\n1.Do not re-use capacitors that were removed from the equipment.\n2.Confirm capacitance characteristics under actual applied voltage.\n3.Confirm the mechanical stress under actual process and equipment use.\n4.Confirm the rated capacitance, rated voltage and other electrical characteristics before assembly.\n5.Prior to use, confirm the solderability of capacitors that were in long-term storage.\n6.Prior to measuring capacitance, carry out a heat treatment for capacitors that were in long-term storage.\n7.The use of Sn-Zn based solder will deteriorate the reliability of the MLCC.\nPlease contact our sales representative or product engineers on the use of Sn-Zn based solder in advance.\n8.We have also produced a DVD which shows a summary of our opinions, regarding the precautions for mounting.\nPlease contact our sales representative to request the DVD.\n3.Maintenance of the Mounting (pick and place) Machine\n1.Make sure that the following excessive forces are not applied to the capacitors.\n1-1. In mounting the capacitors on the printed circuit board, any bending force against them shall be kept to a minimum\nto prevent them from any bending damage or cracking. Please take into account the following precautions and\nrecommendations for use in your process.\n(1)Adjust the lowest position of the pickup nozzle so as not to bend the printed circuit board.\n(2)Adjust the nozzle pressure within a static load of 1N to 3N during mounting.Contents of Measures Stress Level Contents of Measures Stress Level\n(2) Add slits in the board separation part.

This imposes greater force upon the chip during mounting, causing cracked chips. Also, the locating \nclaw, when worn out, imposes uneven forces on the chip when positioning, causing cracked chips.\nThe suction nozzle and the locating claw must be maintained, checked, and replaced periodically.\n4-1. Reflow Soldering\n1.When sudden heat is applied to the components, the [Standard Conditions for Reflow Soldering]\nmechanical strength of the components will decrease\nbecause a sudden  temperature change causes deformation\ninside the components. In order to prevent mechanical damage\nto the components,  preheating is required for both the\ncomponents and the PCB. Preheating conditions are shown\nin table 1. It is required to keep the temperature differential\nbetween the solder and the components  surface (ΔT) as small\nas possible.\n2.Solderability of tin plating termination chips might be\ndeteriorated when a low temperature soldering profile where\nthe peak solder temperature is below the melting point of tin\nis used. Please confirm the solderability of tin plated\ntermination chips before use.\n3.When components are immersed in solvent after mounting,\nbe sure to maintain the temperature difference (ΔT) between\nthe component and the solvent within the range shown in table 1.\nTable 1\nRecommended Conditions\n[Allowable Reflow Soldering Temperature and Time]\nPb-Sn Solder: Sn-37Pb\nLead Free Solder: Sn-3.0Ag-0.5Cu\n4.Optimum Solder Amount for Reflow Soldering\n4-1. If solder paste is excessive, solder between a chip and a\nmetal terminal melts. This causes the chip to move and\ncome off.\n4-2. If solder paste is too little, it causes a lack of adhesive\nstrength on the metal terminal and the capacitor comes off.\n4-3. Please make sure that solder is smoothly applied higher\nthan 0.3mm and lower than the level of the bottom of the\nchip.\nMake sure not to impose any abnormal mechanical shocks to the PCB.\n4-2.

Correction of Soldered Portion\n1.For the shape of the soldering iron tip, refer to the figure\non the right.\n2.Regarding the type of solder, use a wire diameter of\nφ0.5mm or less (rosin core wire solder).\n3.Apply the tip of the soldering iron against the lower end\nof the metal terminal.\n(1)In order to prevent cracking caused by sudden heating\nof the ceramic device, do not touch the ceramic base\ndirectly.\n(2)In order to prevent deviations and dislocating of the\nchip, do not touch the junction of the chip and the metal\nterminal, and the metal portion on the outside directly.\n4.The amount of solder for corrections by soldering iron,\nshould be lower than the height of the lower side of the chip.\n5.Washing\nExcessive ultrasonic oscillation during cleaning can cause the PCBs to resonate, resulting in cracked chips or broken\nsolder joints. Take note not to vibrate PCBs.\n6.Electrical Test on Printed Circuit Board\n1.Confirm position of the backup pin or specific jig, when inspecting the electrical performance of a capacitor after\nmounting on the printed circuit board.\n1-1. Avoid bending the printed circuit board by the pressure of a test-probe, etc. The thrusting force of the test probe can\nflex the PCB, resulting in cracked chips or open solder joints. Provide backup pins on the back side of the PCB\nto prevent warping or flexing. Install backup pins as close to the capacitor as possible.\n1-2. Avoid vibration of the board by shock when a test-probe contacts a printed circuit board.\n[Not Recommended] [Recommended]\n7.Printed Circuit Board Cropping\n1.After mounting a capacitor on a printed circuit board, do not apply any stress to the capacitor that causes bending \nor twisting the board.\n1-1. In cropping the board, the stress as shown at right may cause the capacitor to crack. Cracked capacitors may cause\ndeterioration of the insulation resistance, and result in a short. Avoid this type of stress to a capacitor.\n[Bending] [Twisting]\nBackup Pin\nIn section\nTest-probeSolder Amount\nPeeling\nTest-probe\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n5 / 21\nCaution\n2.Check the cropping method for the printed circuit board in advance.\n2-1. Printed circuit board cropping shall be carried out by using a jig or an apparatus (Disk separator, router type separator,\netc.) to prevent the mechanical stress that can occur to the board.\n* When a board separation jig or disk separator is used, if the following precautions are not observed, a large board deflection stress will occur and the capacitors\nmay crack. Use router type separator if at all possible.\n(1)Example of a suitable jig\n[In the case of Single-side Mounting]\nAn outline of the board separation jig is shown as follows. Recommended example: Stress on the component \nmounting position can be minimized by holding the portion close to the jig, and bend in the direction towards\nthe side where the capacitors are mounted. Not recommended example: The risk of cracks occurring in the \ncapacitors increases due to large stress being applied to the component mounting position, if the portion away \nfrom the jig is held and bent in the direction opposite the side where the capacitors are mounted.\n[Outline of Jig]\n[In the case of Double-sided Mounting]\nSince components are mounted on both sides of the board, the risk of cracks occurring can not be avoided with the\nabove method. Therefore, implement the following measures to prevent stress from being applied to the components.\n(Measures)\n①Consider introducing a router type separator. If it is difficult to introduce a router type separator, implement \nthe following measures. (Refer to item 1. Mounting Position)\n②Mount the components at a right angle to the board separation surface.\n③When mounting components near the board separation point, add slits in the separation position\nnear the component.\n④Keep the mounting position of the components away from the board separation point.\n(2)Example of a Disk Separator\nAn outline of a disk separator is shown as follows. As shown in the Principle of Operation, the top blade and bottom\nblade are aligned with the V-grooves on the printed circuit board to separate the board. In the following case, board\ndeflection stress will be applied and cause cracks in the capacitors.\n①When the adjustment of the top and bottom blades are misaligned, such as deviating in the top-bottom, left-right\nor front-rear directions\n②The angle of the V groove is too low, depth of the V groove is too shallow, or the V groove is misaligned\ntop-bottom IF V groove is too deep, it is possible to brake when you handle and carry it. Carefully design depth of \nthe V groove with consideration about strength of material of the printed circuit board.\n[Outline of Machine] [Principle of Operation] [Cross-section Diagram]RecommendedBoard Separation MethodHand Separation\nNipper Separation\nNot Recommended(1) Board Separation JigBoard Separation Apparatus\n(2) Disk Separator (3) Router Type Separator\nLevel of stress on board High Medium Medium Low\nRecommended × △* △* ○\nNotesHand and nipper separation \napply a high level of stress.\nUse another method. · Board handling\n · Board bending direction\n · Layout of capacitors · Board handling\n · Layout of slits\n · Design of V groove\n · Arrangement of blades\n · Controlling blade lifeBoard handling\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n6 / 21\nCaution\n(3)Example of Router Type Separator\nThe router type separator performs cutting by a router rotating at a high speed. Since the board does not bend in the\ncutting process, stress on the board can be suppressed during board separation. When attaching or removing\nboards to/from the router type separator, carefully handle the boards to prevent bending.\n[Outline Drawing]\n8.Assembly\n1.Handling\nIf a board mounted with capacitors is held with one hand, the board may bend. Firmly hold the edges of the board with\nboth hands when handling. If a board mounted with capacitors is dropped, cracks may occur in the capacitors.\nDo not use dropped boards, as there is a possibility that the quality of the capacitors may be impaired.\n2.Attachment of Other Components\n2-1. Mounting of Other Components\nPay attention to the following items, when mounting other\ncomponents on the back side of the board after capacitors\nhave been mounted on the opposite side. When the bottom\ndead point of the suction nozzle is set too low, board deflection\nstress may be applied to the capacitors on the back side\n(bottom side), and cracks may occur in the capacitors.\n・After the board is straightened, set the bottom dead point\nof the nozzle on the upper surface of the board.\n・Periodically check and adjust the bottom dead point.\n2-2. Inserting Components with Leads into Boards\nWhen inserting components (transformers, IC, etc.) into boards,\nbending the board may cause cracks in the capacitors or \ncracks in the solder. Pay attention to the following.\n・Increase the size of the holes to insert the leads, to reduce\nthe stress on the board during insertion.\n・Fix the board with backup pins or a dedicated jig before\ninsertion.\n・Support below the board so that the board does not bend.\nWhen using multiple backup pins on the board, periodically\nconfirm that there is no difference in the height of each\nbackup pin.Top-bottom Misalignment Left-right Misalignment Front-rear MisalignmentRecommendedNot Recommended\nTop Blade \u3000\nBottom BladeTop Blade \u3000\nBottom BladeTop Blade \u3000\nBottom BladeTop Blade \u3000\nBottom Blade\nExample of \nRecommended\nV-groove DesignNot Recommended\nLeft-right Misalignment Low-Angle Depth too Shallow Depth too Deep\nRouter\nSuction Nozzle\nComponent with Leads\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n7 / 21\nCaution\n2-3. Attaching/Removing Sockets\nWhen the board itself is a connector, the board may bend when\na socket is attached or removed. Plan the work so that the board\ndoes not bend when a socket is attached or removed.\n2-4. Tightening Screws\nThe board may be bent, when tightening screws, etc. during the\nattachment of the board to a shield or chassis.\nPay attention to the following items before performing the work.\n・Plan the work to prevent the board from bending.\n・Use a torque screwdriver, to prevent over-tightening of the\nscrews.\n・The board may bend after mounting by reflow soldering, etc.\nPlease note, as stress may be applied to the chips by forcibly\nflattening the board when tightening the screws.\n■Other\n1.Under Operation of Equipment\n1-1. Do not touch a capacitor directly with bare hands during operation in order to avoid the danger of an electric shock.\n1-2. Do not allow the terminals of a capacitor to come in contact with any conductive objects (short-circuit). Do not \nexpose a capacitor to a conductive liquid, including any acid or alkali solutions.\n1-3. Confirm the environment in which the equipment will operate is under the specified conditions. Do not use\nthe equipment under the following environments.\n(1)Being spattered with water or oil.\n(2)Being exposed to direct sunlight.\n(3)Being exposed to ozone, ultraviolet rays, or radiation.\n(4)Being exposed to toxic gas (e.g., hydrogen sulfide, sulfur dioxide, chlorine, ammonia gas, etc.)\n(5)Any vibrations or mechanical shocks exceeding the specified limits.\n(6)Moisture condensing environments.\n1-4. Use damp proof countermeasures if using under any conditions that can cause condensation.\n2.Other\n2-1. In an Emergency\n(1)If the equipment should generate smoke, fire, or smell, immediately turn off or unplug the equipment. If the\nequipment is not turned off or unplugged, the hazards may be worsened by supplying continuous power.\n(2)In this type of situation, do not allow face and hands to come in contact with the capacitor or burns may be\ncaused by the capacitor's high temperature.\n2-2. Disposal of Waste\nWhen capacitors are disposed of, they must be burned or buried by an industrial waste vendor with the appropriate\n licenses.\n2-3. Circuit Design\n(1)Addition of Fail Safe Function\nCapacitors that are cracked by dropping or bending of the board may cause deterioration of the insulation\nresistance, and result in a short. If the circuit being used may cause an electrical shock, smoke or fire when\na capacitor is shorted, be sure to install fail-safe functions, such as a fuse, to prevent secondary accidents.\n(2)Capacitors used to prevent electromagnetic interference in the primary AC side circuit, or as a \nconnection/insulation, must be a safety standard certified product, or satisfy the contents stipulated\nin the Electrical Appliance and Material Safety Law. Install a fuse for each line in case of a short.\n(3)The KR3, KRM, KC3, KCM series are not safety standard certified products.\n2-4. Remarks\nFailure to follow the cautions may result, worst case, in a short circuit and smoking when the product is used.\nThe above notices are for standard applications and conditions. Contact us when the products are used\n in special mounting conditions. Select optimum conditions for operation as they determine the reliability of \n the product after assembly. The data herein are given in typical values, not guaranteed ratings.\n3.Limitation of applications\nPlease contact us before using our products for the applications listed below which require especially high reliability\n for the prevention of defects which might directly cause damage to the third party’s life, body or property.\n(1) Aircraft equipment (2) Aerospace equipment (3) Undersea equipment (4) Power plant control equipment\n(5) Medical equipment (6) Transportation equipment (vehicles, trains, ships, etc.) (7) Traffic signal equipment\n(8) Disaster prevention/crime prevention equipment (9) Data-processing equipment exerting influence on public\n(10) Application of similar complexity and/or reliability requirements to the applications listed in the above.\nSocket\nScrewdriver\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n8 / 21\nNotice\n■Rating\n1.Operating Temperature\n1.The operating temperature limit depends on the capacitor.\n1-1. Do not apply temperatures exceeding the upper operating temperature. It is necessary to select a capacitor with\na suitable rated temperature that will cover the operating temperature range. It is also necessary to consider\nthe temperature distribution in equipment and the seasonal temperature variable factor.\n1-2. Consider the self-heating factor of the capacitor. The surface temperature of the capacitor shall be the upper\noperating temperature or less when including the self-heating factors.\n2.Atmosphere Surroundings (gaseous and liquid)\n1.Restriction on the operating environment of capacitors.\n1-1. Capacitors, when used in the above, unsuitable, operating environments may deteriorate due to the corrosion\nof the terminations and the penetration of moisture into the capacitor.\n1-2. The same phenomenon as the above may occur when the electrodes or terminals of the capacitor are subject \nto moisture condensation.\n1-3. The deterioration of characteristics and insulation resistance due to the oxidization or corrosion of terminal\nelectrodes may result in breakdown when the capacitor is exposed to corrosive or volatile gases or solvents\nfor long periods of time.\n3.Piezo-electric Phenomenon\n1.When using high dielectric constant type capacitors in AC or pulse circuits, the capacitor itself vibrates at specific\nfrequencies and noise may be generated. Moreover, when the mechanical vibration or shock is added to the capacitor,\nnoise may occur.\n■Soldering and Mounting\n1.PCB Design\n1.Notice for Pattern Forms\n1-1. Unlike leaded components, chip components are susceptible to flexing stresses since they are mounted directly\non the substrate. They are also more sensitive to mechanical and thermal stresses than leaded components.\nExcess solder fillet height can multiply these tresses and cause chip cracking. When designing substrates, \ntake land patterns and dimensions into consideration to eliminate the possibility of excess solder fillet height.\n1-2. There is a possibility of chip cracking caused by PCB expansion/contraction with heat, because stress on a chip is\ndifferent depending on PCB material and structure. When the thermal expansion coefficient greatly differs between\nthe board used for mounting and the chip, it will cause cracking of the chip due to the thermal expansion and\ncontraction. When small size capacitors of 1005 size or less are mounted on a single-layered glass epoxy board, \nit will also cause cracking of the chip for the same reason.\nPattern Forms\nProhibited Correct\nPlacing Close to Chassis\nPlacing\nof Chip Components\nand Leaded Components\nPlacing\nof Leaded Components\nafter Chip Component\nLateral Mounting\nChassis\nSolder(ground)\nElectrode PatternSolder Resist\nLead WireSolder Resist\nSolder Resist\nSolder ResistSoldering Iron\nLead Wire\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n9 / 21\nNotice\n2.Land Dimensions\n2-1. Chip capacitors can be cracked due to the stress of PCB\nbending, etc. if the land area is larger than needed and\nhas an excess amount of solder. Please refer to the land\ndimensions in the following table for reflow soldering.\n Please confirm the suitable land dimension by evaluating\nof the actual SET / PCB.\n3.Board Design\nWhen designing the board, keep in mind that the amount of strain which occurs will increase depending on the size\nand material of the board.\n4.Washing\n1.Please evaluate the capacitor using actual cleaning equipment and conditions to confirm the quality, and select the\nsolvent for cleaning.\n2.Unsuitable cleaning solvent may leave residual flux or other foreign substances, causing deterioration of electrical\ncharacteristics and the reliability of the capacitors.\n3.Select the proper cleaning conditions.\n3-1. Improper cleaning conditions  (excessive or insufficient) may result in deterioration of the  performance of the capacitors.\n5.Coating\n1.A crack may be cause in the capacitor due to the stress of the thermal contraction of the resin during curing process. The\nstress is affected by the amount of resin and curing contraction. Select a resin with low curing contraction. The difference\nin the thermal expansion coefficient between a coating resin or a molding resin and the capacitor may cause the\ndestruction and deterioration of the capacitor such as a crack or peeling, and lead to the deterioration of insulation\nresistance or dielectric breakdown. Select a resin for which the thermal expansion coefficient is as close to that of the\ncapacitor as possible.

The capacitors shall be protected against excessive temperature, humidity, and mechanical force during\n transportation.\n(1)Climatic condition\n・low air temperature : -40 ℃\n・change of temperature air/air : -25 ℃/+25℃\n・low air pressure : 30kPa\n・change of air pressure : 6kPa/min.\n(2)Mechanical condition\nTransportation shall be done in such a way that the boxes are not deformed and forced are not directly passed \non to the inner packaging.\n1-2. Do not apply excessive vibration, shock, or pressure to the capacitor.\n(1)When excessive mechanical shock or pressure is applied to a capacitor, chipping or cracking may occur\n in the ceramic body of the capacitor.\n(2)When the sharp edge of an air driver, a soldering iron, tweezers, a chassis, etc. impacts strongly  on the surface\nof the capacitor, the capacitor may crack and short-circuit.\n1-3. Do not use a capacitor to which excessive shock was applied by dropping, etc. A capacitor dropped accidentally\nduring processing may be damaged.\n2.Characteristics Evaluation in the Actual System\n1.Evaluate the capacitor in the actual system, to confirm that there is no problem with the performance and specification\nvalues in a finished product before using.\n2.Since a voltage dependency and temperature dependency exists in the capacitance of high dielectric type ceramic\ncapacitors, the capacitance may change depending on the operating conditions in the actual system. Therefore, \nbe sure to evaluate the various characteristics, such as the leakage current and noise absorptivity, which will affect \nthe capacitance value of the capacitor.\n3.In addition, voltages exceeding the predetermined surge may be applied to the capacitor by the  inductance in the actual\nsystem. Evaluate the surge resistance in the actual system as required.\nNote\n1.Please make sure that your product has been evaluated in view of your specifications with our product being mounted \nto your product.\n2.You are requested not to use our product deviating from this specification.\nEGKRC01\nReference only\n11 / 21\nETKCM5502B \n    \n  1.
