The TPS785-Q1  is a flexible device for post \nregulation because this device supports an input \nvoltage range from 1.7 V to 6.0 V and offers an \nadjustable output range of 1.2 V to 5.5 V. The device \nalso features fixed output voltages from 0.65 V to \n5.0 V for powering common voltage rails.\nThe TPS785-Q1  offers foldback current limit to reduce \npower dissipation during a over current condition. The \nEN input helps with power sequencing requirements \nof the system. The internal soft-start provides a \ncontrolled start up reducing the inrush current allowing \nfor lower input capacitance to be used.\nThe TPS785-Q1  provides an active pulldown circuit to \nquickly discharge output loads when disabled.\nDevice Information(1) \nPART NUMBER PACKAGE BODY SIZE (NOM)\nTPS785-Q1Wettable flank \nVSON (8)3.00 mm × 3.00 mm\nTO-252 (5) 6.10 mm × 6.60 mm\n(1) For all available packages, see the orderable addendum at \nthe end of the data sheet.\nTPS785-Q1IN\nENOUT\nGNDCOUT CIN\nDC/DC \nConverter \n IN OUT\nCOUT\nVENGND\nGNDGNDGNDVIN VOUT\nGND\nTypical Application CircuitTPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B  – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022\nAn IMPORTANT NOTICE at the end of this data sheet addresses availability, warranty, changes, use in safety-critical applications, \nintellectual property matters and other important disclaimers.

The current limit is a hybrid brickwall-foldback scheme. The current limit transitions from a \nbrickwall scheme to a foldback scheme at the foldback voltage (V FOLDBACK ). In a high-load current fault with \nthe output voltage above V FOLDBACK , the brickwall scheme limits the output current to the current limit (I CL). \nWhen the voltage drops below V FOLDBACK , a foldback current limit activates that scales back the current as the \noutput voltage approaches GND. When the output is shorted, the device supplies a typical current called the \nshort-circuit current limit (I SC). ICL and I SC are listed in the Electrical Characteristics  table.\nFor this device, V FOLDBACK  = 0.4 × V OUT(NOM) .\nThe output voltage is not regulated when the device is in current limit. When a current limit event occurs, the \ndevice begins to heat up because of the increase in power dissipation. When the device is in brickwall current \nlimit, the pass transistor dissipates power [(V IN – V OUT) × I CL]. When the device output is shorted and the output \nis below V FOLDBACK , the pass transistor dissipates power [(V IN – V OUT) × I SC]. If thermal shutdown is triggered, \nthe device turns off. After the device cools down, the internal thermal shutdown circuit turns the device back on. \nIf the output current fault condition continues, the device cycles between current limit and thermal shutdown. For \nmore information on current limits, see the Know Your Limits  application report .\nFigure 7-3  shows a diagram of the foldback current limit.\nVOUT(NOM)\n0 V\n0 mAVOUT\nVFOLDBACK\nICL ISC IRATEDIOUTBrickwall\nFoldback\nFigure 7-3. Foldback Current Limit\n7.3.2 Output Enable\nThe enable pin (EN) is active high. Enable the device by forcing the voltage of the enable pin to exceed the \nminimum EN pin high-level input voltage (see the Electrical Characteristics  table). Turn off the device by forcing \nthe voltage of the enable pin to drop below the maximum EN pin low-level input voltage (see the Electrical \nCharacteristics  table). If shutdown capability is not required, connect EN to IN.\nThis device has an internal pulldown circuit that activates when the device is disabled to actively discharge the \noutput voltage.TPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n16 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\n7.3.3 Active Discharge\nThe device has an internal pulldown MOSFET that connects an R PULLDOWN  resistor to ground when the device is \ndisabled to actively discharge the output voltage. The active discharge circuit is activated by the enable pin.\nDo not rely on the active discharge circuit to discharge the output voltage after the input supply has collapsed \nbecause reverse current can possibly flow from the output to the input. This reverse current flow can cause \ndamage to the device, especially when a large output capacitor is used. Limit reverse current to no more than \n5% of the device rated current for a short period of time.\n7.3.4 Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO) Operation\nThe UVLO circuit ensures that the device stays disabled before its input supply reaches the minimum \noperational voltage range, and ensures that the device shuts down when the input supply collapses. Figure \n7-4 shows the UVLO circuit response to various input voltage events. The diagram can be separated into the \nfollowing parts:\n•Region A: The device does not start until the input reaches the UVLO rising threshold.\n•Region B: Normal operation, regulating device.\n•Region C: Brownout event above the UVLO falling threshold (UVLO rising threshold – UVLO hysteresis). The \noutput may fall out of regulation but the device remains enabled.\n•Region D: Normal operation, regulating device.\n•Region E: Brownout event below the UVLO falling threshold. The device is disabled in most cases and the \noutput falls because of the load and active discharge circuit. The device is reenabled when the UVLO rising \nthreshold is reached by the input voltage and a normal start-up follows.\n•Region F: Normal operation followed by the input falling to the UVLO falling threshold.\n•Region G: The device is disabled when the input voltage falls below the UVLO falling threshold to 0 V. The \noutput falls because of the load and active discharge circuit.\nC\ntAtVIN\nVOUTUVLO Rising Threshold\nUVLO Hysteresis\ntBt tDt tEt tFt tGt\nFigure 7-4. Typical UVLO Operation\n7.3.5 Dropout Voltage\nDropout voltage (V DO) is defined as the input voltage minus the output voltage (V IN – V OUT) at the rated output \ncurrent (I RATED ), where the pass transistor is fully on. I RATED  is the maximum I OUT listed in the Recommended \nOperating Conditions  table. The pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region of operation, and acts as a \nswitch. The dropout voltage indirectly specifies a minimum input voltage greater than the nominal programmed \noutput voltage at which the output voltage is expected to stay in regulation. If the input voltage falls to less than \nthe nominal output regulation, then the output voltage falls as well.\nFor a CMOS regulator, the dropout voltage is determined by the drain-source on-state resistance (R DS(ON) ) of the \npass transistor. Therefore, if the linear regulator operates at less than the rated current, the dropout voltage for \nthat current scales accordingly. The following equation calculates the R DS(ON)  of the device.\nR =DS(ON)VDO\nIRATED\n(1)www.ti.comTPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 17\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\n7.3.6 Thermal Shutdown\nThe device contains a thermal shutdown protection circuit to disable the device when the junction temperature\n(TJ) of the pass transistor rises to T SD(shutdown)  (typical). Thermal shutdown hysteresis assures that the device \nresets (turns on) when the temperature falls to T SD(reset)  (typical).\nThe thermal time-constant of the semiconductor die is fairly short, thus the device may cycle on and off \nwhen thermal shutdown is reached until power dissipation is reduced. Power dissipation during startup can \nbe high from large V IN – V OUT voltage drops across the device or from high inrush currents charging large \noutput capacitors. Under some conditions, the thermal shutdown protection disables the device before startup \ncompletes.\nFor reliable operation, limit the junction temperature to the maximum listed in the Recommended Operating \nConditions  table. Operation above this maximum temperature causes the device to exceed its operational \nspecifications. Although the internal protection circuitry of the device is designed to protect against thermal \noverall conditions, this circuitry is not intended to replace proper heat sinking. Continuously running the device \ninto thermal shutdown or above the maximum recommended junction temperature reduces long-term reliability.TPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n18 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\n7.4 Device Functional Modes\n7.4.1 Device Functional Mode Comparison\nThe Device Functional Mode Comparison  table shows the conditions that lead to the different modes of \noperation. See the Electrical Characteristics  table for parameter values.\nTable 7-1. Device Functional Mode Comparison\nOPERATING MODEPARAMETER\nVIN VEN IOUT TJ\nNormal operation VIN > V OUT(nom)  + V DO and V IN > V IN(min) VEN > V EN(HI) IOUT < IOUT(max) TJ < T SD(shutdown)\nDropout operation VIN(min)  < V IN < V OUT(nom)  + V DO VEN > V EN(HI) IOUT < IOUT(max) TJ < T SD(shutdown)\nDisabled\n(any true condition \ndisables the device)VIN < V UVLO VEN < V EN(LOW) Not applicable TJ > T SD(shutdown)\n7.4.2 Normal Operation\nThe device regulates to the nominal output voltage when the following conditions are met:\n•The input voltage is greater than the nominal output voltage plus the dropout voltage (V OUT(nom)  + V DO)\n•The output current is less than the current limit (I OUT < ICL)\n•The device junction temperature is less than the thermal shutdown temperature (T J < T SD)\n•The enable voltage has previously exceeded the enable rising threshold voltage and has not yet decreased \nto less than the enable falling threshold\n7.4.3 Dropout Operation\nIf the input voltage is lower than the nominal output voltage plus the specified dropout voltage, but all other \nconditions are met for normal operation, the device operates in dropout mode. In this mode, the output voltage \ntracks the input voltage. During this mode, the transient performance of the device becomes significantly \ndegraded because the pass transistor is in the ohmic or triode region, and acts as a switch. Line or load \ntransients in dropout can result in large output-voltage deviations.\nWhen the device is in a steady dropout state (defined as when the device is in dropout, V IN < V OUT(NOM)  + V DO, \ndirectly after being in a normal regulation state, but not during startup), the pass transistor is driven into the \nohmic or triode region. When the input voltage returns to a value greater than or equal to the nominal output \nvoltage plus the dropout voltage (V OUT(NOM)  + V DO), the output voltage can overshoot for a short period of time \nwhile the device pulls the pass transistor back into the linear region.\n7.4.4 Disabled\nThe output of the device can be shutdown by forcing the voltage of the enable pin to less than the maximum \nEN pin low-level input voltage (see the Electrical Characteristics  table). When disabled, the pass transistor is \nturned off, internal circuits are shutdown, and the output voltage is actively discharged to ground by an internal \ndischarge circuit from the output to ground.www.ti.comTPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 19\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\n8 Application and Implementation\nNote\nInformation in the following applications sections is not part of the TI component specification, \nand TI does not warrant its accuracy or completeness. TI’s customers are responsible for \ndetermining suitability of components for their purposes, as well as validating and testing their design \nimplementation to confirm system functionality.\n8.1 Application Information\n8.1.1 Recommended Capacitor Types\nThe device is designed to be stable using low equivalent series resistance (ESR) ceramic capacitors at the input \nand output. Multilayer ceramic capacitors have become the industry standard for these types of applications and \nare recommended, but must be used with good judgment. Ceramic capacitors that employ X7R-, X5R-, and \nC0G-rated dielectric materials provide relatively good capacitive stability across temperature, whereas the use of \nY5V-rated capacitors is discouraged because of large variations in capacitance.\nRegardless of the ceramic capacitor type selected, the effective capacitance varies with operating voltage and \ntemperature. As a rule of thumb, expect the effective capacitance to decrease by as much as 50%. The input \nand output capacitors recommended in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table account for an effective \ncapacitance of approximately 50% of the nominal value.\n8.1.2 Input and Output Capacitor Requirements\nThe device requires an input capacitor of 1.0 µF or larger as specified in the Recommended Operating \nConditions  table for stability. A higher value capacitor may be necessary if large, fast rise-time load or line \ntransients are anticipated or if the device is located several inches from the input power source.\nThe device also requires an output capacitor of 1.0 µF or larger as specified in the Recommended Operating \nConditions  table for stability. Dynamic performance of the device is improved by using a higher capacitor than \nthe minimum output capacitor.\n8.1.3 Adjustable Device Feedback Resistors\nThe device requires external feedback divider resistors to set the output voltage. Figure 8-1  shows how the \noutput voltage of an adjustable device can be configured from 1.2 V to 5.5 V by using a resistor divider network.\nTPS785-Q1IN\nENOUT\nGNDCOUTCIN CFF\nR1\nR2Feed-forward capacitor C FF is not required for stability (optional)\nFB\nGNDVIN\nVENVOUT\nGND\nFigure 8-1.

Lowering the value of R 2 increases the \nimmunity against noise injection. Increasing the value of R 2 reduces the quiescent current for achieving higher \nefficiency at low load currents. Equation 3  calculates the setting that provides the maximum feedback divider \nseries resistance.\n(R1 + R 2) ≤ V OUT / (IFB × 100) (3)\n8.1.4 Load Transient Response\nThe load-step transient response is the output voltage response by the LDO to a step in load current, whereby \noutput voltage regulation is maintained. There are two key transitions during a load transient response: the \ntransition from a light to a heavy load and the transition from a heavy to a light load. The regions shown in Figure \n8-2 are broken down as follows. Regions A, E, and H are where the output voltage is in steady-state.\ntAt tDt tEt tCt tGt tHt\nF B\nFigure 8-2. Load Transient Waveform\nDuring transitions from a light load to a heavy load, the:\n•Initial voltage dip is a result of the depletion of the output capacitor charge and parasitic impedance to the \noutput capacitor (region B)\n•Recovery from the dip results from the LDO increasing its sourcing current, and leads to output voltage \nregulation (region C)\n•Initial voltage rise results from the LDO sourcing a large current, and leads to the output capacitor charge to \nincrease (region F)\n•Recovery from the rise results from the LDO decreasing its sourcing current in combination with the load \ndischarging the output capacitor (region G)\nA larger output capacitance reduces the peaks during a load transient but slows down the response time of the \ndevice. A larger DC load also reduces the peaks because the amplitude of the transition is lowered and a higher \ncurrent discharge path is provided for the output capacitor.www.ti.comTPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 21\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\n8.1.5 Exiting Dropout\nSome applications have transients that place the LDO into dropout, such as slower ramps on V IN during start-up. \nAs with other LDOs, the output can overshoot on recovery from these conditions. A ramping input supply causes \nan LDO to overshoot on start-up, as shown in Figure 8-3 , when the slew rate and voltage levels are in the \ncorrect range. Use an enable signal to avoid this condition.\nInput Voltage\nOutput Voltage\nOutput Voltage in \nnormal regulation.Dropout \nVOUT = V IN - V DOVIN = V OUT(nom) + V DOResponse time for \nLDO to get back into \nregulation.Load current discharges \noutput voltage.Voltage\nTime\nFigure 8-3. Start-Up Into Dropout\nLine transients out of dropout can also cause overshoot on the output of the regulator. These overshoots are \ncaused by the error amplifier having to drive the gate capacitance of the pass element and bring the gate back to \nthe correct voltage for proper regulation. Figure 8-4  illustrates what is happening internally with the gate voltage \nand how overshoot can be caused during operation. When the LDO is placed in dropout, the gate voltage (V GS) \nis pulled all the way down to ground to give the pass device the lowest on-resistance as possible. However, if \na line transient occurs when the device is in dropout, the loop is not in regulation and can cause the output to \novershoot until the loop responds and the output current pulls the output voltage back down into regulation. If \nthese transients are not acceptable, then continue to add input capacitance in the system until the transient is \nslow enough to reduce the overshoot.TPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n22 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\nOutput Voltage in \nnormal regulationDropout \nVOUT = V IN - V DOTransient response \ntime of the LDO\nLoad current \ndischarges \noutput \nvoltageVoltage\nTimeVGS voltage for \nnormal operation\nVGS voltage in \ndropout (pass device \nfully on)VDO\nGate VoltageInput Voltage\nVGS voltage for \nnormal operationInput Voltage\nOutput Voltage\nVGS voltage \n(pass device \nfully off)TimeVoltageFigure 8-4. Line Transients From Dropout\n8.1.6 Dropout Voltage\nThe device uses a PMOS pass transistor to achieve low dropout. When (V IN – V OUT) is less than the dropout \nvoltage (V DO), the PMOS pass device is in the linear region of operation and the input-to-output resistance is the \nRDS(ON)  of the PMOS pass element. V DO scales approximately with output current because the PMOS device \nbehaves like a resistor in dropout mode. As with any linear regulator, PSRR and transient response degrade as \n(VIN – V OUT) approaches dropout operation.\n8.1.7 Reverse Current\nAs with most LDOs, excessive reverse current can damage this device.\nReverse current flows through the body diode on the pass element instead of the normal conducting channel. \nAt high magnitudes, this current flow degrades the long-term reliability of the device as a result of one of the \nfollowing conditions:\n•Degradation caused by electromigration\n•Excessive heat dissipation\n•Potential for a latch-up conditionwww.ti.comTPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 23\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\nConditions where reverse current can occur are outlined in this section, all of which can exceed the absolute \nmaximum rating of V OUT > V IN + 0.3 V:\n•If the device has a large C OUT and the input supply collapses with little or no load current\n•The output is biased when the input supply is not established\n•The output is biased above the input supply\nIf reverse current flow is expected in the application, external protection must be used to protect the device. \nFigure 8-5  shows one approach of protecting the device.\nDeviceIN OUT\nGND\n \nCOUT \nCINSchottky Diode\nInternal Body Diode\nFigure 8-5. Example Circuit for Reverse Current Protection Using a Schottky Diode\n8.1.8 Feed-Forward Capacitor (C FF)\nFor the adjustable-voltage version device, a feed-forward capacitor (C FF) can be connected from the OUT pin \nto the FB pin. C FF improves transient, noise, and PSRR performance, but is not required for regulator stability. \nRecommended C FF values are listed in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table. A higher capacitance \nCFF can be used; however, the startup time increases. For a detailed description of C FF tradeoffs, see the Pros \nand Cons of Using a Feedforward Capacitor with a Low-Dropout Regulator  application report.\n8.1.9 Power Dissipation (P D)\nCircuit reliability demands that proper consideration be given to device power dissipation, location of the circuit \non the printed circuit board (PCB), and correct sizing of the thermal plane. The PCB area around the regulator \nmust be as free as possible of other heat-generating devices that cause added thermal stresses.\nAs a first-order approximation, power dissipation in the regulator depends on the input-to-output voltage \ndifference and load conditions. Use Equation 4  to approximate P D:\nPD = (V IN – V OUT) × I OUT (4)\nPower dissipation can be minimized, and thus greater efficiency achieved, by proper selection of the system \nvoltage rails. Proper selection allows the minimum input-to-output voltage differential to be obtained. The low \ndropout of the TPS785-Q1  allows for maximum efficiency across a wide range of output voltages.\nThe main heat conduction path for the device is through the thermal pad on the package. As such, the thermal \npad must be soldered to a copper pad area under the device. This pad area contains an array of plated vias that \nconduct heat to any inner plane areas or to a bottom-side copper plane.\nThe maximum power dissipation determines the maximum allowable junction temperature (T J) for the device. \nAccording to Equation 5 , power dissipation and junction temperature are most often related by the junction-to-\nambient thermal resistance (R θJA) of the combined PCB and device package and the temperature of the ambient \nair (T A). Equation 6  rearranges Equation 5  for output current.\nTJ = T A + (R θJA × P D) (5)\nIOUT = (T J – T A) / [R θJA × (V IN – V OUT)] (6)\nUnfortunately, this thermal resistance (R θJA) is highly dependent on the heat-spreading capability built into the \nparticular PCB design, and therefore varies according to the total copper area, copper weight, and location TPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022 www.ti.com\n24 Submit Document Feedback Copyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\nof the planes. The R θJA recorded in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table is determined by the \nJEDEC standard, PCB, and copper-spreading area, and is only used as a relative measure of package thermal \nperformance. For a well-designed thermal layout, R θJA is actually the sum of the VSON package junction-to-case \n(bottom) thermal resistance (R θJC(bot) ) plus the thermal resistance contribution by the PCB copper.\n8.1.9.1 Estimating Junction Temperature\nThe JEDEC standard now recommends the use of psi ( Ψ) thermal metrics to estimate the junction temperatures \nof the LDO when in-circuit on a typical PCB board application. These metrics are not strictly speaking thermal \nresistances, but rather offer practical and relative means of estimating junction temperatures. These psi metrics \nare determined to be significantly independent of the copper-spreading area. The key thermal metrics ( ΨJT and \nΨJB) are used in accordance with Equation 7  and are given in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table.\nΨJT : TJ = T T + Ψ JT × P D and Ψ JB : TJ = T B + Ψ JB × P D (7)\nwhere:\n•PD is the power dissipated as explained in Equation 4\n•TT is the temperature at the center-top of the device package, and\n•TB is the PCB surface temperature measured 1 mm from the device package and centered on the package \nedge\n8.1.9.2 Recommended Area for Continuous Operation\nThe operational area of an LDO is limited by the dropout voltage, output current, junction temperature, and input \nvoltage. The recommended area for continuous operation for a linear regulator is given in Figure 8-6  and can be \nseparated into the following parts:\n•Dropout voltage limits the minimum differential voltage between the input and the output (V IN – V OUT) at a \ngiven output current level. See the Dropout Voltage  section for more details.\n•The rated output currents limits the maximum recommended output current level. Exceeding this rating \ncauses the device to fall out of specification.\n•The rated junction temperature limits the maximum junction temperature of the device. Exceeding this rating \ncauses the device to fall out of specification and reduces long-term reliability.\n–The shape of the slope is given by Equation 6 . The slope is nonlinear because the maximum rated \njunction temperature of the LDO is controlled by the power dissipation across the LDO; thus when V IN – \nVOUT increases the output current must decrease.\n•The rated input voltage range governs both the minimum and maximum of V IN – V OUT.www.ti.comTPS785-Q1\nSBVS388B – JANUARY 2021 – REVISED JANUARY 2022\nCopyright © 2022 Texas Instruments Incorporated Submit Document Feedback 25\nProduct Folder Links: TPS785-Q1\nFigure 8-6  shows the recommended area of operation for this device on a JEDEC-standard high-K board with a \nRθJA as given in the Recommended Operating Conditions  table.\nRated output \ncurrentOutput current limited \nby dropoutOutput current limited by thermals\nLimited by \nminimum V INLimited by \nmaximum V IN\nVIN ± VOUT (V)Output current (A)\nFigure 8-6.

The allowable power dissipation was estimated \nusing the following equation. As disscussed in the An empirical analysis of the impact of board layout on \nLDO thermal performance  application report , thermal dissipation can be improved in the JEDEC high-K layout \nby adding top layer copper and increasing the number of thermal vias.

The input supply must \nbe well regulated and free of spurious noise. To ensure that the output voltage is well regulated and dynamic \nperformance is optimum, the input supply must be at least V OUT(nom)  + 0.75 V. TI requires using a 1-µF or greater \ninput capacitor to reduce the impedance of the input supply, especially during transients.\n10 Layout\n10.1 Layout Guidelines\n•Place input and output capacitors as close to the device as possible.\n•Use copper planes for device connections in order to optimize thermal performance.\n•Place thermal vias around the device to distribute the heat.\n•Only place tented thermal vias directly beneath the thermal pad of the DRB package. An untented via can \nwick solder or solder paste away from the thermal pad joint during the soldering process, leading to a \ncompromised solder joint on the thermal pad.\n10.1.1 Additional Layout Considerations\nThe high impedance of the FB pin makes the regulator sensitive to parasitic capacitances that may couple \nundesirable signals from nearby components (especially from logic and digital devices, such as microcontrollers \nand microprocessors); these capacitively coupled signals may produce undesirable output voltage transients. In \nthese cases, TI recommends using a fixed-voltage version of the device, or isolating the FB node by placing a \ncopper ground plane on the layer directly underneath the LDO circuitry and FB pin to minimize any undesirable \nsignal coupling.\nPCB Copper Area (cm\x15)Junction-to-ambient thermal resistance (R TJA) (qC/W)\n0 20 40 60 80 1002030405060708090100110\n1oz PCB\n2oz PCB\n4-layer PCB\nFigure 10-1.
