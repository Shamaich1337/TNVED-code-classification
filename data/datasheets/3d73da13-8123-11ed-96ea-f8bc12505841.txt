This amplifier is \ndesigned for operation from 700 MHz to 6 GHz and \nis housed in a lead -free 2 mm 8 -lead PDFN plastic \npackage.  \n \nThis low noise amplifier has an integrated active \nbias circuit allowing direct connection to 3 V or 5 V   \nbias and minimizing variations over temperature and \nprocess. The bias current is set by an external \nresistor, so the user can customize the power \nconsumption to fit the application. V BIAS can be \nutilized as an enable pin to power the device up and \ndown during operation.  \n \nIn the 50 Ω environment and at 3 V, the            \nMAAL -011078 offers 0.5 dB noise figure at 2.6 GHz, \nwith 22 dB of gain and over 33 dBm output third \norder intercept point (OIP3). It is ideal for 5G & 4G \ncellular infrastructure and Wi -Fi applications.

A separate V BIAS voltage allows pin 5 (V BIAS) to be used as an enable pin to power the device up and \ndown during operation.  \n \nFor both bias methods select the value of R BIAS to achieve the desired current based on the tables on page 4, and \nuse DC blocks at pin 2 (RF IN) and pin 7 (RF OUT / VDD). \nDC Block\nRFOUT RFIN\nVDD  DC Block\nRBIASRF Choke\nBypass2 75\nBiasing Option  -  Separate V DD and V BIAS Voltages (V BIAS ≤ V DD) \nTo use separate V DD and V BIAS voltages, connect pin 7 (RF OUT / VDD) to V DD through an RF choke inductor and \nconnect pin 5 (V BIAS) to V BIAS through bias resistor R BIAS as shown in Figure 2.  Typical current (I BIAS) draw for pin 5 \n(VBIAS)  is 1.4 mA @ V BIAS = 3 V and 1 µA @ V BIAS = 0 V.  Typical current (I DD) draw for pin 7 (RF OUT / VDD) is            \n< 1 µA @ V BIAS = 0 V.
