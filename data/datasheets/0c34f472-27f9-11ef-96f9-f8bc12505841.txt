This allows great flexibility in the selection of soldering parameters. The tin pre-\nvents the nickel layer from oxidizing and thus ensures better wetting by the solder. The nickel bar-\nrier termination is suitable for all commonly-used soldering methods.\nMultilayer CTVS: Structure of nickel barrier termination\n1.2 Silver-palladiumtermination\nSilver-palladium terminations are used for the large case sizes 1812 and 2220 and for chips in-\ntended for conductive adhesion. This metallization improves the resistance of large chips to ther-\nmal shock.\nIn case of conductive adhesion, the silver-palladium metallization reduces susceptibility to corro-\nsion. Silver-palladium termination can be used for smaller case sizes (only chip) for hybrid appli-\ncations as well. The silver-palladium termination is not approved for lead-free soldering.\nMultilayer varistor: Structure of silver-palladium terminationMultilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 57 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\n1.3 Silver-platinumtermination\nSilver-platinum terminations are mainly used for the large case sizes 1812 and 2220.

This problem is sometimes interpret-\ned as leaching of the external terminations.\nIf the solder meniscus is too high, i.e. the solder quantity is too large, the vise effect may occur.\nAs the solder cools down, the solder contracts in the direction of the component. If there is too\nmuch solder on the component, it has no leeway to evade the stress and may break, as in a vise.\nThe figures below show good and poor solder joints for dual-wave and infrared soldering.\n4.1.1 Solderjointprofilesfornickelbarriertermination-dual-wavesoldering\nGood and poor solder joints caused by amount of solder in dual-wave soldering.\n4.1.2 Solderjointprofilesfornickelbarriertermination/silver-palladium/silver-platinum\ntermination-reflowsolderingMultilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 61 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\nGood and poor solder joints caused by amount of solder in reflow soldering.\n5 Conductiveadhesion\nAttaching surface-mounted devices (SMDs) with electrically conductive adhesives is a commer-\ncially attractive method of component connection to supplement or even replace conventional sol-\ndering methods.\nElectrically conductive adhesives consist of a non-conductive plastic (epoxy resin, polyimide or\nsilicon) in which electrically conductive metal particles (gold, silver, palladium, nickel, etc) are em-\nbedded. Electrical conduction is effected by contact between the metal particles.\nAdhesion is particularly suitable for meeting the demands of hybrid technology. The adhesives\ncan be deposited ready for production requirements by screen printing, stamping or by dis-\npensers. As shown in the following table, conductive adhesion involves two work operations fewer\nthan soldering.\nReflowsoldering Wavesoldering Conductiveadhesion\nScreen-print solder paste Apply glue dot Screen-print conductive adhesive\nMount SMD Mount SMD Mount SMD\nPredry solder paste Cure glue Cure adhesive\nReflow soldering Wave soldering Inspect\nWash Wash\nInspect InspectMultilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 62 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\nA further advantage of adhesion is that the components are subjected to virtually no temperature\nshock at all. The curing temperatures of the adhesives are between 120 °C and 180 °C, typical\ncuring times are between 30 minutes and one hour.\nThe bending strength of glued chips is, in comparison with that of soldered chips, higher by a fac-\ntor of at least 2, as is to be expected due to the elasticity of the glued joints.\nThe lower conductivity of conductive adhesive may lead to higher contact resistance and thus re-\nsult in electrical data different to those of soldered components. Users must pay special attention\nto this in RF applications.\n6 Solderabilitytests\nTest Standard Test conditions\nSn-Pb solderingTest conditions\nPb-free solderingCriteria/ test results\nWettability IEC\n60068-2-58Immersion in\n60/40 SnPb solder\nusing non-activated\nflux at 215 ±3°C\nfor 3±0.3 sImmersion in\nSn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5\nsolder using non- or\nlow activated flux\nat 245±5°C\nfor 3±0.3 sCovering of 95% of\nend termination,\nchecked by visual\ninspection\nLeaching\nresistanceIEC\n60068-2-58Immersion in\n60/40 SnPb\nsolder using\nmildly activated flux\nwithout preheating\nat 260±5°C\nfor 10±1 sImmersion in\nSn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5\nsolder using non- or\nlow activated flux\nwithout preheating\nat 255±5°C\nfor 10±1 sNo leaching of\ncontacts\nThermal shock\n(solder shock)Dip soldering at\n300°C/5 sDip soldering at\n300°C/5 sNo deterioration of\nelectrical parameters.\nCapacitance change:\n≤ ±15%\nTests of resistance\nto soldering heat\nfor SMDsIEC\n60068-2-58Immersion in\n60/40 SnPb for 10 s\nat 260°CImmersion in\nSn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5\nfor 10 s at 260 °CChange of varistor\nvoltage:\n≤ ±5%\nTests of resistance\nto soldering heat\nfor radial leaded\ncomponents\n(SHCV)IEC\n60068-2-20Immersion\nof leads in\n60/40 SnPb\nfor 10 s at 260 °CImmersion\nof leads in\nSn96.5Ag3.0Cu0.5\nfor 10 s at 260 °CChange of varistor\nvoltage: ≤ ±5%\nChange of\ncapacitance X7R:\n≤ \x055/+10%Multilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 63 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\nNote:\nLeachingofthetermination\nEffective area at the termination might be lost if the soldering temperature and/or immersion time\nare not kept within the recommended conditions.

Please refer to chapter 2.\n7.2 Repair/rework\nManual soldering with a soldering iron must be avoided, hot-air methods are recommended for\nrework purposes.\n7.3 Cleaning\nAll environmentally compatible agents are suitable for cleaning. Select the appropriate cleaning\nsolution according to the type of flux used. The temperature difference between the components\nand cleaning liquid must not be greater than 100 °C. Ultrasonic cleaning should be carried out\nwith the utmost caution. Too high ultrasonic power can impair the adhesive strength of the metal-\nlized surfaces.\n7.4 Solderpasteprinting(reflowsoldering)\nAn excessive application of solder paste results in too high a solder fillet, thus making the chip\nmore susceptible to mechanical and thermal stress. Too little solder paste reduces the adhesive\nstrength on the outer electrodes and thus weakens the bonding to the PCB. The solder should be\napplied smoothly to the end surface.Multilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 64 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\n7.5 Adhesiveapplication\nThin or insufficient adhesive causes chips to loosen or become disconnected during curing.\nLow viscosity of the adhesive causes chips to slip after mounting. It is advised to consult the\nmanufacturer of the adhesive on proper usage and amounts of adhesive to use.\n7.6 Selectionofflux\nUsed flux should have less than or equal to 0.1 wt % of halogenated content, since flux residue\nafter soldering could lead to corrosion of the termination and/or increased leakage current on the\nsurface of the component. Strong acidic flux must not be used. The amount of flux applied should\nbe carefully controlled, since an excess may generate flux gas, which in turn is detrimental to sol-\nderability.\n7.7 StorageofCTVSs\nSolderability is guaranteed for one year from date of delivery for multilayer varistors, CeraDiodes\nand ESD/EMI filters (half a year for chips with AgPd and AgPt terminations) and two years for\nSHCV and CU components, provided that components are stored in their original packages.\nStorage temperature: \x0525°C to +45 °C\nRelative humidity: ≤75% annual average, ≤95% on 30 days a year\nThe solderability of the external electrodes may deteriorate if SMDs and leaded components are\nstored where they are exposed to high humidity, dust or harmful gas (hydrogen chloride, sulfurous\nacid gas or hydrogen sulfide).\nDo not store SMDs and leaded components where they are exposed to heat or direct sunlight.\nOtherwise the packing material may be deformed or SMDs/ leaded components may stick togeth-\ner, causing problems during mounting.\nAfter opening the factory seals, such as polyvinyl-sealed packages, it is recommended to use the\nSMDs or leaded components as soon as possible.\n7.8 Placementofcomponentsoncircuitboard\nEspecially in the case of dual-wave soldering, it is of advantage to place the components on the\nboard before soldering in that way that their two terminals do not enter the solder bath at different\ntimes.\nIdeally, both terminals should be wetted simultaneously.\n7.9 Solderingcautions\nAn excessively long soldering time or high soldering temperature results in leaching of the outer\nelectrodes, causing poor adhesion and a change of electrical properties of the varistor due to\nthe loss of contact between electrodes and termination.\nWave soldering must not be applied for MLVs designated for reflow soldering only.\nKeep the recommended down-cooling rate.Multilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 65 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\n7.10 Standards\nCECC 00802\nIEC 60068-2-58\nIEC 60068-2-20\nJEDEC J-STD-020DMultilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 66 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\nSymbolsandterms\nSymbol Term\nCline,typ Typical capacitance per line\nCmax Maximum capacitance\nCmin Minimum capacitance\nCnom Nominal capacitance\nΔCnom Tolerance of nominal capacitance\nCtyp Typical capacitance\nfcut-off,min Minimum cut-off frequency\nI Current\nIclamp Clamping current\nIleak Leakage current\nIleak,typ Typical leakage current\nIPP Peak pulse current\nIsurge,max Maximum surge current (also termed peak current)\nLCT Lower category temperature\nLtyp Typical inductance\nPdiss,max Maximum power dissipation\nPPP Peak pulse power\nRins Insulation resistance\nRmin Minimum resistance\nRS Resistance per line\nTA Ambient temperature\nTop Operating temperature\nTstg Storage temperature\ntr Duration of equivalent rectangular wave\ntresp Response time\nUCT Upper category temperature\nV Voltage\nVBR,min Minimum breakdown voltage\nVclamp,max Maximum clamping voltage\nVDC,max Maximum DC operating voltage (also termed working voltage)\nVESD,air Air discharge ESD capability\nVESD,contact Contact discharge ESD capability\nVjump Maximum jump start voltageMultilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 67 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\nVRMS,max Maximum AC operating voltage, root-mean-square value\nVV Varistor voltage (also termed breakdown voltage)\nVV,min Minimum varistor voltage\nVV,max Maximum varistor voltage\nΔVV Tolerance of varistor voltage\nWLD Maximum load dump\nWmax Maximum energy absorption (also termed transient energy)\nαtyp Typical insertion loss\nLead spacing\n\x07* \x08 Maximum possible application conditions\nAll dimensions are given in mm.\nThe commas used in numerical values denote decimal points.Multilayervaristors(MLVs)\nAutomotiveseries\nPage 68 of 72 Please read Cautions and warnings and\nImportant notes at the end of this document.\n\nCautionsandwarnings\nGeneral\nSome parts of this publication contain statements about the suitability of our ceramic transient\nvoltage suppressor (CTVS) components (multilayer varistors (MLVs), CeraDiodes, ESD/EMI\nfilters, SMD disk varistors (CU types), leaded transient voltage/ RFI suppressors (SHCV types))\nfor certain areas of application, including recommendations about incorporation/design-in of these\nproducts into customer applications. The statements are based on our knowledge of typical\nrequirements often made of our CTVS devices in the particular areas. We nevertheless expressly\npoint out that such statements cannot be regarded as binding statements about the suitability of\nour CTVS components for a particular customer application. As a rule, EPCOS is either unfamiliar\nwith individual customer applications or less familiar with them than the customers themselves.\nFor these reasons, it is always incumbent on the customer to check and decide whether the\nCTVS devices with the properties described in the product specification are suitable for use in a\nparticular customer application.\nDo not use EPCOS CTVS components for purposes not identified in our specifications,\napplication notes and data books.\nEnsure the suitability of a CTVS in particular by testing it for reliability during design-in. Always\nevaluate a CTVS component under worst-case conditions.\nPay special attention to the reliability of CTVS devices intended for use in safety-critical\napplications (e.g. medical equipment, automotive, spacecraft, nuclear power plant).\nDesignnotes\nAlways connect a CTVS in parallel with the electronic circuit to be protected.\nConsider maximum rated power dissipation if a CTVS has insufficient time to cool down\nbetween a number of pulses occurring within a specified isolated time period.
