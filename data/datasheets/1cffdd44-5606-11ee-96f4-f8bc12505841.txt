GND pins to a \nlocal ground plane below the LTM8073 and the circuit \ncomponents. In most applications, the bulk of the heat flow out of the LTM8073 is through these pads, so the \nprinted circuit design has a large impact on the ther -\nmal performance of the part. See the PCB Layout and Thermal Considerations sections for more details. \nVIN (Bank 2):  VIN supplies current to the LTM8073’s \ninternal regulator and to the internal power switch. These \npins must be locally bypassed with an external, low ESR \ncapacitor; see Table 1 for recommended values.\nVOUT (Bank 3):  Power Output Pins. Apply the output \nfilter capacitor and the output load between these pins and GND pins.\nBIAS (Pin A2):  The BIAS pin connects to the internal \npower bus. Connect to a power source greater than 3.2V. \nIf VOUT is greater than 3.2V, connect this pin to AUX. \nDecouple this pin with at least 1µF if the voltage source for BIAS is remote.PG (Pin A3):  The PG pin is the open-collector output \nof an internal comparator . PG remains low until the FB pin voltage is between 0.73V and 0.88V typical. The PG signal is valid when V\nIN is above 3.4V. If V IN is above \n3.4V and RUN is low, PG will drive low. If this function is not used, leave this pin floating.\nSHARE (Pin A4): Tie this to the SHARE pin of another \nLTM8073  to load share. Otherwise leave floating. Do not \ndrive this pin.\nRT (Pin A5):  The RT pin is used to program the switching \nfrequency of the LTM8073 by connecting a resistor from \nthis pin to ground. The Applications Information section \nof the data sheet includes a table to determine the resis -\ntance value based on the desired switching frequency. Minimize capacitance at this pin. Do not drive this pin.\nFB (Pin B1): The \nLTM8073 regulates its FB pin to 0.8V. \nConnect the adjust resistor from this pin to ground. The \nvalue of R FB is given by the equation R FB = 199.7/(V OUT \n– 0.8), where R FB is in kΩ.\nLTM807311\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073pin Func Tions\nAUX (Pin B2): Low Current Voltage Source for BIAS. \nIn many designs, the BIAS pin is simply connected to \nVOUT. The AUX pin is internally connected to V OUT and \nis placed adjacent to the BIAS pin to ease printed cir -\ncuit board routing. Also, some applications require a \nfeed-forward capacitor; it can be connected from AUX to FB for convenient PCB routing. Although this pin is internally connected to V\nOUT, it is not intended to deliver \na high current, so do not draw current from this pin to the load.\nSYNC (Pin B4): External clock synchronization input \nand operational mode. This pin programs four different \noperating modes:  1) Burst Mode®. Tie this pin to ground \nfor Burst Mode operation at low output loads— this \nwill result in low quiescent current. 2) Pulse-skipping \nmode. Float this pin for pulse-skipping mode. This mode \noffers full frequency operation down to low output loads \nbefore pulse-skipping mode occurs. 3) Spread spectrum \nmode. Tie this pin high (between 2.9V and 4.2V) for pulse-skipping mode with spread spectrum modulation. \n4) Synchronization mode. Drive this pin with a clock \nsource to synchronize to an external frequency. During synchronization the part will operate in pulse-skipping mode.\nTR/SS (Pin B5):  The TR/SS pin is used to provide a \nsoft-start or tracking function. The internal 2μA pull-up \ncurrent in combination with an external capacitor tied \nto this pin creates a voltage ramp. If TR/SS is less than \n0.8V, the FB voltage tracks to this value. For tracking, tie \na resistor divider to this pin from the tracked output. This \npin is pulled to ground with an internal MOSFET during shutdown and fault conditions; use a series resistor if driving from a low impedance output. This pin may be left floating if the tracking function is not needed.\nRUN (Pin B6):  Pull the RUN pin below 0.9V to shut down \nthe LTM8073. Tie to 1.06V or more for normal opera -\ntion. If the shutdown feature is not used, tie this pin to the V\nIN pin.\nblock Diagra M\nAUXBIAS\nVOUTVIN\nFBGND\nRUN\nSHARE TR/SS SYNC RT PG\n8073 BDCURRENT\nMODE\nCONTROLLER0.2µF\n10pF\n0.1µF249k2.2µH\nLTM807312\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073opera Tion\nThe LTM8073 is a standalone nonisolated step-down \nswitching DC/DC power supply that can deliver up to 5A. \nThe continuous current is determined by the internal oper -\nating temperature. It provides a precisely regulated output \nvoltage programmable via one external resistor from 0.8V  \nto 15V. The input voltage range is 3.4V to 60V. Given that \nthe LTM8073 is a step-down converter , make sure that the \ninput voltage is high enough to support the desired output \nvoltage and load current. A simplified Block Diagram is \ngiven on the previous page.\nThe LTM8073 contains a current mode controller , power \nswitching elements, power inductor and a modest amount \nof input and output capacitance. The LTM8073 is a fixed \nfrequency PWM regulator . The switching frequency is set by simply connecting the appropriate resistor value from the RT pin to GND.\nAn internal regulator provides power to the control cir -\ncuitry. This bias regulator normally draws power from the \nVIN pin, but if the BIAS pin is connected to an external \nvoltage higher than 3.2V, bias power is drawn from the external source (typically the regulated output voltage). This improves efficiency. The RUN pin is used to place the LTM8073 in shutdown, disconnecting the output and reducing the input current to a few μA.\nTo enhance efficiency, the LTM8073 automatically switches to Burst Mode operation in light or no load \nsituations. Between bursts, all circuitry associated with \ncontrolling the output switch is shut down reducing the input supply current. The oscillator reduces the LTM8073’ s operating frequency \nwhen the voltage at the FB pin is low. This frequency fold -\nback helps to control the output current during start-up and overload.\nThe TR/SS node acts as an auxiliary input to the error \namplifier . The voltage at FB servos to the TR/SS voltage until TR/SS goes above about 0.8V. Soft-start is imple -\nmented by generating a voltage ramp at the TR/SS pin \nusing an external capacitor which is charged by an internal \nconstant current. Alternatively, driving the TR/SS pin with \na signal source or resistive network provides a tracking function.  Do not drive the TR/SS pin with a low imped -\nance voltage source. See the Applications Information \nsection for more details.\nThe LTM8073 contains a power good comparator which \ntrips when the FB pin is between 0.73V and 0.88V, typical. \nThe PG output is an open-drain transistor that is off when \nthe output is in regulation, allowing an external resistor \nto pull the PG pin high. The PG signal is valid when V IN \nis above 3.4V. If V IN is above 3.4V and RUN is low, PG \nwill drive low.\nThe LTM8073 is equipped with a thermal shutdown that \ninhibits power switching at high junction temperatures.  \nThe activation threshold of this function is above 125°C  to \navoid interfering with normal operation, so prolonged or \nrepetitive operation under a condition in which the thermal \nshutdown activates may damage or impair the reliability of the device.\nLTM807313\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073applica Tions inForMaTion\nFor most applications, the design process is straight-\nforward, summarized as follows: \n1. Look at Table 1 and find the row that has the desired \ninput range and output voltage.\n2. Apply the recommended C IN, COUT, RFB and R T values.\n3. Apply the C FF (from AUX to FB) capacitor as required.\n4. Connect BIAS as indicated.While these component combinations have been tested for \nproper operation, it is incumbent upon the user to verify \nproper operation over the intended system’ s line, load and \nenvironmental conditions.

Applying capacitor values below those indi -\ncated in Table 1 is not recommended, and may result in \nundesirable operation. Using larger values is generally \nacceptable, and can yield improved dynamic response, \nif it is necessary. Again, it is incumbent upon the user to verify proper operation over the intended system’s line, load and environmental conditions.\nCeramic capacitors are small, robust and have very low \nESR. However , not all ceramic capacitors are suitable. X5R \nand X7R types are stable over temperature and applied \nvoltage and give dependable service. Other types, includ -\ning Y5V and Z5U have very large temperature and voltage \ncoefficients of capacitance. In an application circuit they may have only a small fraction of their nominal capaci -\ntance resulting in much higher output voltage ripple than expected.\nCeramic capacitors are also piezoelectric. \nIn Burst Mode \noperation, the LTM8073’s switching frequency depends \non the load current, and can excite a ceramic capacitor at audio frequencies, generating audible noise. Since the LTM8073 operates at a lower current limit during Burst \nMode operation, the noise is typically very quiet to a \ncasual ear .\nIf this audible noise is unacceptable, use a high perfor -\nmance electrolytic capacitor at the output. It may also be \na parallel combination of a ceramic capacitor and a low cost electrolytic capacitor . \nA final precaution regarding ceramic capacitors concerns \nthe maximum input voltage rating of the LTM8073. A ceramic input capacitor combined with trace or cable \ninductance forms a high-Q (underdamped) tank circuit. If the LTM8073 circuit is plugged into a live supply, the input voltage can ring to twice its nominal value, possi -\nbly exceeding the device’s rating. This situation is easily avoided; see the Hot-Plugging Safely section.Frequency Selection\nThe \nLTM8073 uses a constant frequency PWM architec -\nture that can be programmed to switch from 200kHz to \n3MHz  by using a resistor tied from the R\nT pin to ground. \nTable\xa02 provides a list of R T resistor values and their resul -\ntant frequencies.\nTable 2.

System level or other considerations, \nhowever , may necessitate another operating frequency. While the LTM8073 is flexible enough to accommodate \na wide range of operating frequencies, a haphazardly \nchosen one may result in undesirable operation under \ncertain operating or fault conditions. A frequency that is too high can reduce efficiency, generate excessive heat \nor even damage the LTM8073 if the output is overloaded \nor short-circuited. A frequency that is too low can result in a final design that has too much output ripple or too large of an output capacitor .\nLTM807315\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073applica Tions inForMaTion\nBIAS Pin Considerations\nThe BIAS pin is used to provide drive power for the inter -\nnal power switching stage and operate other internal cir -\ncuitry. For proper operation, it must be powered by at \nleast 3.2V. If the output voltage is programmed to 3.2V \nor higher , BIAS may be simply tied to AUX . If V OUT is less \nthan 3.2V, BIAS can be tied to V IN or some other voltage \nsource. If the BIAS pin voltage is too high, the efficiency of the LTM8073 may suffer . The optimum BIAS voltage is \ndependent upon many factors, such as load current, input \nvoltage, output voltage and switching frequency. In all \ncases, ensure that the maximum voltage at the BIAS pin is less than 19V. If BIAS power is applied from a remote or noisy voltage source, it may be necessary to apply a \ndecoupling capacitor locally to the pin. A 1µF ceramic \ncapacitor works well. The BIAS pin may also be left open at the cost of a small degradation in efficiency.\nIf the LTM8073 is configured to provide a negative output, \ndo not connect BIAS to V\nOUT or AUX. Instead, tie to BIAS \nto the LTM8073  GND, which should be the negative output.\nMaximum Load\nThe maximum practical continuous load that the LTM8073  \ncan drive, while rated at 3A, actually depends upon both \nthe internal current limit and the internal temperature.  \nThe internal current limit is designed to prevent damage to the LTM8073 in the case of overload or short-circuit.  The internal temperature of the LTM8073 depends upon \noperating conditions such as the ambient temperature, \nthe power delivered, and the heat sinking capability of the \nsystem. For example, if the LTM8073  is configured to reg-\nulate at 1.2V , it may continuously deliver 4.5A from 12V IN \nif the ambient temperature is controlled to less than 55°C; \nthis is more than the 3A continuous rating.  Please see the \nderating curve for V OUT = 1.2V in the Typical Performance \nCharacteristics section. Similarly, if the output voltage is 15V and the ambient temperature is 95°C, the LTM8073 will deliver at most 2A from 24V\nIN, which is less than the \n3A continuous rating.  \nLoad Sharing\nLTM8073s may be paralleled to produce higher currents. \nTo do this, tie the V IN, VOUT and SHARE pins of all the paralleled LTM8073s together . To ensure that paralleled \nmodules start up together , the TR/SS pins may be tied \ntogether , as well. If it is inconvenient to tie the TR/SS pins \ntogether , make sure that the same valued soft-start capac -\nitors are used for each µModule regulator . An example of \ntwo LTM8073s configured for load sharing is given in the \nTypical Applications section.For closer load sharing, synchronize the LTM8073s to an \nexternal clock source. When load sharing among n units \nand using a single R FB resistor , the value of the resistor is:\n  RFB=199.7\nn VOUT– 0.8 ( )\nwhere R FB is in kΩ.\nBurst Mode Operation\nTo enhance efficiency at light loads, the LTM8073 auto -\nmatically switches to Burst Mode operation which keeps \nthe output capacitor charged to the proper voltage while \nminimizing the input quiescent current. During Burst \nMode operation, the LTM8073 delivers single cycle bursts \nof current to the output capacitor followed by sleep peri -\nods where most of the internal circuitry is powered off \nand energy is delivered to the load by the output capacitor . \nDuring the sleep time, V IN and BIAS quiescent currents \nare greatly reduced, so, as the load current decreases \ntowards a no load condition, the percentage of time that the LTM8073 operates in sleep mode increases and the \naverage input current is greatly reduced, resulting in \nhigher light load efficiency.\nBurst Mode operation is enabled by tying SYNC to GND. \nMinimum Input Voltage\nThe LTM8073 is a step-down converter , so a minimum \namount of headroom is required to keep the output in \nregulation. Keep the input above 3.4V to ensure proper \noperation. Voltage transients or ripple valleys that cause the input to fall below 3.4V may turn off the LTM8073.\nOutput Voltage T racking and Soft-Start\nThe LTM8073 allows the user to program its output volt -\nage ramp rate by means of the TR/SS pin. An internal 2μA  \nLTM807316\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073applica Tions inForMaTion\npulls up the TR/SS pin to about 2.4V. Putting an external \ncapacitor on TR/SS enables soft starting the output to \nreduce current surges on the input supply. During the soft-\nstart ramp the output voltage will proportionally track the \nTR/SS pin voltage. For output tracking applications, TR/SS \ncan be externally driven by another voltage source. From \n0V to 0.8V, the TR/SS voltage will override the internal \n0.8V reference input to the error amplifier , thus regulating \nthe FB pin voltage to that of the TR/SS pin. When TR/SS is above 0.8V, tracking is disabled and the feedback voltage will regulate to the internal reference voltage. The TR/SS pin may be left floating if the function is not needed.\nAn active pull-down circuit is connected to the TR/SS pin \nwhich will discharge the external soft-start capacitor in \nthe case of fault conditions and restart the ramp when the \nfaults are cleared. Fault conditions that clear the soft-start \ncapacitor are the RUN pin transitioning low, V IN voltage \nfalling too low, or thermal shutdown.\nPrebiased Output\nAs discussed in the Output Voltage T racking and Soft-Start \nsection, the LTM8073 regulates the output to the FB volt -\nage determined by the TR/SS pin whenever TR/SS is less \nthan 0.8V. If the LTM8073 output is higher than the target \noutput voltage, the LTM8073 will attempt to regulate the \noutput to the target voltage by returning a small amount \nof energy back to the input supply. If there is nothing load -\ning the input supply, its voltage may rise. Take care that it does not rise so high that the input voltage exceeds the absolute maximum rating of the LTM8073.\nFrequency Foldback\nThe LTM8073 is equipped with frequency foldback which \nacts to reduce the thermal and energy stress on the inter -\nnal power elements during a short-circuit or output over -\nload condition. If the LTM8073 detects that the output \nhas fallen out of regulation, the switching frequency is \nreduced as a function of how far the output is below the \ntarget voltage. This in turn limits the amount of energy that can be delivered to the load under fault. During the \nstart-up time, frequency foldback is also active to limit \nthe energy delivered to the potentially large output capaci -\ntance of the load. When a clock is applied to the SYNC pin, the SYNC pin is floated or held high, the frequency \nfoldback is disabled and the switching frequency will slow \ndown only during overcurrent conditions.\nSynchronization\nTo select low ripple Burst Mode operation, tie the SYNC \npin below about 0.4V (this can be ground or a logic low \noutput). To synchronize the LTM8073 oscillator to an \nexternal frequency connect a square wave (with about \n20% to 80% duty cycle) to the SYNC pin. The square \nwave amplitude should have valleys that are below 0.4V and peaks above 1.5V.\nThe LTM8073 will not enter Burst Mode operation at low \noutput loads while synchronized to an external clock, but \ninstead will pulse skip to maintain regulation. The LTM8073  \nmay be synchronized over a 200kHz to 3MHz range. The R T \nresistor should be chosen to set the LTM8073 switching \nfrequency equal to or below the lowest synchronization \ninput. For example, if the synchronization signal will be \n500kHz and higher , the R T should be selected for 500kHz. \nFor some applications it is desirable for the LTM8073 to operate in pulse-skipping mode, offering two major dif -\nferences from Burst Mode operation. The first is that the \nclock stays awake at all times and all switching cycles \nare aligned to the clock. Second is that full switching fre -\nquency is reached at lower output load than in Burst Mode \noperation. These two differences come at the expense \nof increased quiescent current. To enable pulse-skipping mode, the SYNC pin is floated. \nThe LTM8073 features spread spectrum operation to fur -\nther reduce EMI/EMC emissions. To enable spread spec-\ntrum operation, apply between 2.9V and 4.2V to the SYNC \npin. In this mode, triangular frequency modulation is used \nto vary the switching frequency between the value pro -\ngrammed by R T to about 20% higher than that value. The \nmodulation frequency is about 3kHz. For example, when \nthe LTM8073 is programmed to 2MHz, the frequency will \nvary from 2MHz to 2.4MHz at a 3kHz rate. When spread \nspectrum operation is selected, Burst Mode operation is disabled, and the part will run in pulse-skipping mode. \nThe LTM8073 does not operate in forced continuous \nmode regardless of SYNC signal.\nLTM807317\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073Figure 1a. The LTM8073 Can Be Used to Generate a \nNegative Voltageapplica Tions inForMaTion\nNegative Output\nThe LTM8073 is capable of generating a negative output \nvoltage by connected its V OUT to system GND and the \nLTM8073 GND to the negative voltage rail. An example \nof this is shown in the Typical Applications section. The \nmost versatile way to generate a negative output is to \nuse a dedicated regulator that was designed to generate \na negative voltage, but using a buck regulator like the \nLTM8073 to generate a negative voltage is a simple and cost effective solution, as long as certain restrictions are kept in mind.\nFigure 1a shows a typical negative output voltage applica -\ntion. Note that LTM8073 V OUT is tied to system GND and \ninput power is applied from V IN to LTM8073 V OUT.  As a \nresult, the LTM8073 is not behaving as a true buck regu -\nlator , and the maximum output current is depends upon \nthe input voltage. In the example shown in the Typical \nApplications section, there is an attending graph that \nshows how much current the LTM8073 deliver for given input voltages.The C IN and C OUT capacitors in figure 1c form an AC \ndivider at the negative output voltage node. If V IN is hot-\nplugged or rises quickly, the resultant V OUT will be a posi -\ntive transient, which may be unhealthy for the application load.  An antiparallel Schottky diode may be able to pre-vent this positive transient from damaging the load. The location of \nthis Schottky diode is important. For example, \nin a system where the LTM8073 is far away from the load, \nplacing the Schottky diode closest to the most sensitive load component may be the best design choice. Carefully evaluate whether the negative buck configuration is suit -\nable for the application.\nNote that this configuration requires that any load current \ntransient will directly impress the transient voltage onto the LTM8073 GND, as shown in Figure 1b, so fast load transients can disrupt the LTM8073’s operation or even \ncause damage. Carefully evaluate whether the negative \nbuck configuration is suitable for the application.NEGATIVE\nOUTPUT VOL TAGEL TM8073VOUT VIN\n8073 F01aGNDVINFAST LOAD\nTRANSIENT\nOUTPUT\nTRANSIENT\nRESPONSEL TM8073VOUT VIN\n8073 F01bGNDVIN\nFAST V IN\nTRANSIENT\nOUTPUT EXPERIENCES\nA POSITIVE TRANSIENT\nL TM8073VOUT VIN\n8073 F01cGNDCOUT CIN\nOPTIONAL\nSCHOTTKY\nDIODEAC DIVIDERVINFigure 1b.

Instead, tie to BIAS to \nthe LTM8073 GND, which should be the negative output.\nLTM807318\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073applica Tions inForMaTion\nShorted Input Protection\nCare needs to be taken in systems where the output is \nheld high when the input to the LTM8073 is absent. This \nmay occur in battery charging applications or in battery backup systems where a battery or some other supply is \ndiode OR-ed with the LTM8073’s output. If the V IN pin \nis allowed to float and the RUN pin is held high (either \nby a logic signal or because it is tied to V IN), then the \nLTM8073’ s internal circuitry pulls its quiescent current \nthrough its internal power switch. This is fine if your \nsystem can tolerate a few milliamps in this state. If you ground the RUN pin, the internal current drops to essen -\ntially zero. However , if the V\nIN pin is grounded while the \noutput is held high, parasitic diodes inside the LTM8073 can pull large currents from the output through the V\nIN \npin. Figure 2 shows a circuit that runs only when the input \nvoltage is present and that protects against a shorted or reversed input.minimize EMI and ensure proper operation. Even with the \nhigh level of integration, you may fail to achieve specified operation with a haphazard or poor layout. See Figure 3 \nfor a suggested layout. Ensure that the grounding and \nheat sinking are acceptable.\nA few rules to keep in mind are:\n1. Place C FF, RFB and R T as close as possible to their \nrespective pins.\n2. Place the C IN capacitor as close as possible to the V IN \nand GND connection of the LTM8073.\n3. Place the C OUT capacitor as close as possible to the \nVOUT and GND connection of the LTM8073.\n4. Place the C IN and C OUT capacitors such that their \nground current flow directly adjacent to or underneath \nthe LTM8073.\n5. Connect all of the GND connections to as large a copper \npour or plane area as possible on the top layer . Avoid breaking the ground connection between the external components and the LTM8073.\n6. Use vias to connect the GND copper area to the board’s \ninternal ground planes. Liberally distribute these GND \nvias to provide both a good ground connection and \nthermal path to the internal planes of the printed circuit \nboard.  Pay attention to the location and density of \nthe thermal vias in Figure 3. The LTM8073 can benefit \nfrom the heat-sinking afforded by vias that connect \nto internal GND planes at these locations, due to their \nproximity to internal power handling components. \nThe optimum number of thermal vias depends upon \nthe printed circuit board design. For example, a board might use very small via holes. It should employ more thermal vias than a board that uses larger holes.Figure 2. The Input Diode Prevents a Shorted Input from \nDischarging a Backup Battery Tied to the Output. It Also Protects the Circuit from a Reversed Input. The LTM8073 Runs Only When the Input Is Present.\nPCB Layout\nMost of the headaches associated with PCB layout have \nbeen alleviated or even eliminated by the high level of \nintegration of the LTM8073. The LTM8073 is neverthe -\nless a switching power supply, and care must be taken to L TM8073VIN VIN\n8073 F02RUN\nLTM807319\n8073fa For more information www.linear.com/LTM8073applica Tions inForMaTion\nHot-Plugging Safely\nThe small size, robustness and low impedance of ceramic \ncapacitors make them an attractive option for the input \nbypass capacitor of LTM8073. However , these capaci -\ntors can cause problems if the LTM8073 is plugged into \na live supply (see Linear Technology Application Note \n88 for a complete discussion). The low loss ceramic \ncapacitor combined with stray inductance in series with \nthe power source forms an underdamped tank circuit, \nand the voltage at the V IN pin of the LTM8073 can ring \nto more than twice the nominal input voltage, possibly \nexceeding the LTM8073’s rating and damaging the part. If the input supply is poorly controlled or the LTM8073 is hot-plugged into an energized supply, the input network should be designed to prevent this overshoot. This can be accomplished by installing a small resistor in series to V\nIN, but the most popular method of controlling input \nvoltage overshoot is add an electrolytic bulk cap to the V\nIN net.  This capacitor’s relatively high equivalent series \nresistance damps the circuit and eliminates the voltage overshoot. The extra capacitor improves low frequency ripple filtering and can slightly improve the efficiency of the circuit, though it is likely to be the largest component in the circuit. \nThermal Considerations\nThe LTM8073 output current may need to be derated if \nit is required to operate in a high ambient temperature. \nThe amount of current derating is dependent upon the \ninput voltage, output power and ambient temperature. \nThe derating curves given in the Typical Performance Characteristics section can be used as a guide. These \ncurves were generated by the LTM8073 mounted to a \n58cm2 4-layer FR4 printed circuit board. Boards of other \nsizes and layer count can exhibit different thermal behav -\nior , so it is incumbent upon the user to verify proper oper -\nation over the intended system’s line, load and environ -\nmental operating conditions.\nFor increased accuracy and fidelity to the actual applica -\ntion, many designers use FEA (finite element analysis) to \npredict thermal per formance.  T\no that end, Page 2 of the \ndata sheet typically gives four thermal coefficients:  \nθJA – Thermal resistance from junction to ambient \nθJCbottom  – Thermal resistance from junction to the bot -\ntom of the product caseθ\nJCtop – Thermal resistance from junction to top of the \nproduct caseθ\nJB – Thermal resistance from junction to the printed cir -\ncuit board. \nWhile the meaning of each of these coefficients may seem \nto be intuitive, JEDEC has defined each to avoid confusion \nand inconsistency. These definitions are given in JESD \n51-12, and are quoted or paraphrased below:\nθJA is the natural convection junction-to-ambient air ther -\nmal resistance measured in a one cubic foot sealed enclo -\nsure. This environment is sometimes referred to as still Figure 3.

In the typical µModule regula -\ntor , the bulk of the heat flows out the bottom of the pack -\nage, but there is always heat flow out into the ambient \nenvironment.  As a result, this thermal resistance value \nmay be useful for comparing packages but the test condi -\ntions don’t generally match the user’s application.\nθJCtop is determined with nearly all of the component \npower dissipation flowing through the top of the pack -\nage. As the electrical connections of the typical µModule regulator are on the bottom of the package, it is rare for \nan application to operate such that most of the heat flows \nfrom the junction to the top of the part. As in the case of θ\nJCbottom , this value may be useful for comparing pack -\nages but the test conditions don ’t generally match the \nuser’s application.\nθJB is the junction-to-board thermal resistance where \nalmost all of the heat flows through the bottom of the \nµModule regulator and into the board, and is often just \nthe sum of the θ JCbottom  and the thermal resistance of the \nbottom of the part through the solder joints and through a portion of the board.  The board temperature is measured \na specified distance from the package, using a two sided, two layer board.  This board is described in JESD 51-9.\nGiven these definitions, it should now be apparent that \nnone of these thermal coefficients reflects an actual physi-\ncal operating condition of a µModule regulator . Thus, none \nof them can be individually used to accurately predict the thermal performance of the product.  Likewise, it would be inappropriate to attempt to use any one coefficient to \ncorrelate to the junction temperature vs load graphs given \nin the product’s data sheet.  The only appropriate way to \nuse the coefficients is when running a detailed thermal \nanalysis, such as FEA, which considers all of the thermal resistances simultaneously.\nA graphical representation of these thermal resistances \nis given in Figure 4. The blue resistances are contained within the µModule regulator , and the green are outside.\nThe die temperature of the LTM8073 must be lower than \nthe maximum rating of 125°C , so care should be taken in \nthe layout of the circuit to ensure good heat sinking of the LTM8073. The bulk of the heat flow out of the LTM8073 is through the bottom of the package and the pads into the printed circuit board. Consequently a poor printed circuit \nboard design can cause excessive heating, resulting in \nimpaired performance or reliability.
