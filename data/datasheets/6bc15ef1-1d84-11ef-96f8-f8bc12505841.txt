The control scheme is based on a constant on-time (COT) regulation loop. An additional power saving mode for light load\noperation can be engaged based on the condition applied to the MODE pin.\nThe V OUTof the regulator is divided by the feedback resistor network R FBTand R FBBand fed into the FB pin. The internal\ncomparator compares this signal with the internal 0.8V reference. If the feedback voltage is below the reference, the high side\nMOSFET is turned on for a fixed on-time.\nThe constant on-time control scheme does not require compensation circuitry which makes the overall design very simple.\nNevertheless, it requires a certain minimum ripple at the feedback pin. The MagI3C Power Module 171010550 generates this ripple\ninternally and is supported by the C FFcapacitor which bypasses AC ripple directly to the feedback pin from the output. With this\narchitecture very small output ripple values under 10mV PP(similar to current or voltage mode devices) can be achieved.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 25\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nDESIGN FLOW\nThe next four simple steps will show how to select the external components to design the 171010550 into an application.\nEssential Steps\n1.Set output voltage\n2.Select input capacitor\n3.Select output capacitor\n4.Select feed-forward capacitor\nVIN\nVOUT\nEN\nMODE\nC\nIN\nC\nOUT\nR\nFBT\nFB\nPGND\nV\nIN\nV\nOUT\n3\n2\n6\n1\n4\nR\nFBB\nC\nFF\n5\nGND\nGND\nPGND\nEP\nModule\n2\n.\n1\n.\n4\n.\n3\n.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 26\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nSTEP 1 Setting The Output Voltage (V OUT)\nThe output voltage is selected with an external resistor divider between V OUTand GND (see circuit below). The voltage across the\nlower resistor of the divider is provided to the FB pin and compared with an internal reference voltage of 0.8V (V REF). The output\nvoltage adjustment range is from 0.8V to 5.5V. The output voltage can be calculated according to the following formula:\nVOUT=VREF\x01(RFBT\nRFBB+ 1) (1)\nOne resistor must be chosen and then the other resistor can be calculated. For example, if R FBT= 100k \nthen the resistance value\nof the lower resistor in the feedback network is indicated in the table below for common output voltages.\nVOUT(V) 1.2 1.5 1.8 2.5 3.3 3.6 5\nRFBB(E96)(kW)200 115 80.6 47.5 32.4 28.7 13.8\nV\nOUT\n1\nPGND\n6\nR\nFBB\nVOUT\nFB\nR\nFBT\nMODULE\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 27\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nSTEP 2 Select The Input Capacitor (C IN)\nAn external input capacitor is required to provide the high input pulse current. The external input capacitor must be placed as close\nas possible to the VIN and PGND pins. For this MagI3C MicroModule, it is recommended to use an MLCC (multi-layer ceramic\ncapacitor) of 4.7µF. Attention must be paid to the voltage, frequency, temperature derating and thermal class of the selected\ncapacitor. The Würth Elektronik part number 885012107018 has been experimentally verified to work with this MicroModule.\nSTEP 3 Select The Output Capacitor (C OUT)\nThe output capacitor should be selected in order to minimize the output voltage ripple and to provide a stable voltage at the output.\nIt also affects the loop stability. An external MLCC of 10µF is recommended for all application conditions. Attention must be paid\nto the voltage, frequency, temperature derating and thermal class of the selected capacitor. The Würth Elektronik part numbers\n885012107010 and 885012107014 have been experimentally verified to work with this MicroModule.\nIn general, the output voltage ripple can be calculated using the following equation:\nVOUT ripple = \x01IL\x01ESR + \x01IL\x01(1\n8\x01fSW\x01COUT) (2)\nwhere \x01ILis the inductor current ripple and can be calculated with the following equation:\n\x01IL=VOUT\x01(VIN\x00VOUT)\nfSW\x01L\x01VIN(3)\nExample\nIn the section OUTPUT VOLTAGE RIPPLE on page 35, a ripple measurement is shown under the following conditions:\nVIN= 3.6V\nVOUT= 1.8V\nL = 470nH (internally fixed)\nfSW= 4MHz (internally fixed)\nCOUT= 10µF X5R 0805 10V (Würth Elektronik part number 885012107010)\nAssuming a reduction of the capacitance of about 10% due to the bias voltage, a remaining capacitance of around 9µF can be\nconsidered. Another assumption can be used for the ESR, which can be considered lower than 10m \n. Using Equations (2) and (3),\nthe expected ripple is V OUT_Ripple \x146mV, which matches the results obtained in the measurement.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 28\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nSTEP 4 Select The Feed-Forward Capacitor (C FF)\nThe 171010550 MagI3C MicroModule allows for the selection of a feed forward capacitor, C FF, providing a trade-off between\nresponse time and efficiency while also affecting the transition current threshold between the COT and power save modes. A lower\nvalue of C FFwill increase the light load conversion efficiency while slowing down the response time and increasing the overshoot and\nundershoot. Increasing the C FFvalue will decrease the response time and the overshoot and undershoot while decreasing light load\nconversion efficiency. Increasing the value of C FFresults in higher value of current needed to leave power save mode.\nA CFFof 22pF has been evaluated experimentally as a value with suitable efficiency and transient characteristics for most\napplications.\nThe pictures below show the transient behavior of the 171010550 in response to a load transition from 0A to 1.2A using the\nrecommended C FF= 22pF, as well as other values of C FF.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 29\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nThis behavior is valid only for this test under the specified conditions and must be verified in the real application.\nThe C FFvalue only affects the efficiency during light load conditions when the power save mode is chosen.\nAs explained in the section MODES OF OPERATION on page 32, during light load conditions while the module is operating in\npower save mode (i.e. when the MODE pin is pulled to GND), the device does not continuously switch, instead delivering energy to\nthe load in bursts. The frequency between bursts is influenced by various parameters, including the C FFvalue. The LIGHT LOAD\nOPERATION section provides a more in-depth explanation of the additional parameters which affect behavior in this region.\nIncreasing C FFwill cause the MicroModule to burst more often, resulting in a decrease in light load efficiency as depicted in the\ndiagram below. In addition, increasing the C FFvalue will result in an increase in the current threshold required to exit power save\nmode, also shown below as a difference of almost 100mA.\nIncreasing C FFwill cause the MicroModule to burst more often (shown in the two images above) resulting in a decrease in light load\nefficiency as depicted in the diagram below. In addition, increasing the C FFvalue will result in an increase in the current threshold\nrequired to exit PFM mode, also shown below as a difference of almost 100mA.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 30\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\n64\n66\n68\n70\n72\n74\n76\n78\n80\n82\n84\n86\n88\n90\n92\n0.001\n0.01\n0.1\nEfficiency\n[%]\nOutput Current [A]\nVIN = 5.5V , VOUT = 3.3V Graph, TA = 25\n°\nC\n22pF\n220pF\nWhile the recommended C FFvalue of 22pF will work for most applications, the user can adjust the performance of the MicroModule\nbased on their application by trading between light load efficiency and transient response.

When pulled low, power save operation\nwill occur during light load conditions.\nThe MicroModule will operate in one of four modes, depending on the operating conditions.\nConstant on-time (COT) operation\nThe MicroModule operates at a fixed switching frequency of 4MHz where the duty cycle (DC) is determined by the following\nequation:\nDC=VOUT\nVIN(4)\nThe on-time is determined by the duty cycle and the switching frequency as follows:\ntON=DC\nfSW(5)\nThe on and off-times can be related to the switching frequency as follows:\n1\nfSW=tON+tOFF (6)\nThis mode of operation has a minimum off-time value of 60ns.\nFixed off-time operation\nWhen the minimum off-time of 60ns is reached and the duty cycle must increase futher, the MicroModule fixes the off-time to 60ns\nand begins increasing the on-time. This results in a decrease in switching frequency proportional to the increase in duty cycle.\n100% duty cycle operation\nWhen the input voltage approaches the output voltage and the duty cycle approaches 100%, the MicroModule will leave the high\nside MOSFET on continuously and the output voltage will be limited by the input voltage. Further decreases of input voltage will\nresult in a corresponding decrease in output voltage.\nPower save operation\nPower save operation is initiated when the MicroModule enters discontinuous mode, typically occurring between 0mA and 300mA. A\nburst of switching cycles increases the output voltage above the set value followed by a period of dead time where the output\ncurrent is only delivered by the output capacitor. This results in slightly increased output voltage ripple in exchange for significantly\nincreased conversion efficiency.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 32\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nOUTPUT VOLTAGE RIPPLE\nThe output voltage ripple is also influenced by the selection of the MODE pin. If the forced COT mode is selected and the duty\ncycle is below 76%, the ripple is very low and it always has the same frequency as the internal oscillator (4MHz typ.). If the power\nsave mode is selected and the load current is low enough to be in power save operationor if the duty cycle is high enough to enter\nthe constant off-time mode of operation then the output voltage ripple will be higher and the frequency lower than the nominal\nswitching frequency (see pictures below).\nLow Load Current\nFull Load Current\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 33\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nPROTECTION FEATURES\nOvercurrent Protection (OCP)\nFor protection against load faults, the 171010550 MagI3C MicroModule incorporates a cycle-by-cycle current limiting (see I OCPin\nELECTRICAL SPECIFICATION on page 5). During switching, the output current is limited by turning off the high-side switch when\nthe current limit value is detected. This switching behavior continues, limiting the on-time of the device until the overcurrent\ncondition is removed. When the overcurrent condition is removed, normal switching times resume. The output voltage is reduced to\nzero until the current no longer exceeds the limit.\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nOutput Current [A]\nOutput Voltage [V]\nTime [ms]\nV\nIN\n= 3.6V, V\nOUT\n= 1.8V, I\nOUT\n> 2A \nVout\nIout\nCurrent limit\nOutput voltage drop \nShort Circuit Protection (SCP)\nWhen the 171010550 MagI3C MicroModule experiences a short-circuit condition at the output it will limit the current, typically to\n2.2A, until the thermal protection circuit shuts the module off. If the short-circuit condition is removed, normal switching operation\nwill begin if the module temperature is not exceeding the thermal shutdown threshold.\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\nOutput Current [A]\nOutput Voltage [V]\nTime [ms]\nV\nIN\n= 3.6V, V\nOUT\n= 1.8V, short circuit\nVout\nIout\nShort\ncircuit event \nOutput voltage drop \nCurrent limited\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 34\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nOver Temperature Protection (OTP)\nThermal protection helps prevent catastrophic failures due to accidental device overheating. The junction temperature of the\n171010550 MagI3C MicroModule should not be allowed to exceed its maximum ratings. Thermal protection is implemented by an\ninternal thermal shutdown circuit, which activates when the junction temperature reaches 160°C (typ). Under the thermal shutdown\ncondition both MOSFETs remain off causing V OUTto drop. When the junction temperature falls below 150°C the internal soft-start\nis released, V OUTrises smoothly, and normal operation resumes.\nInput Undervoltage Lockout (UVLO)\nThe device incorporates input undervoltage lockout (UVLO) to protect from unexpected behavior at input voltages below the\nrecommended values. The thresholds of the UVLO are indicated in the ELECTRICAL SPECIFICATIONS on page 5.\nSoft-Start\nThe 171010550 MagI3C MicroModule implements an internal soft-start in order to limit the inrush current and avoid output voltage\novershoot during start-up. The typical duration of the soft-start is around 100µs (see figure below).\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\nV\nEN\n, \nV\nOUT \n[V]\nTime [µs]\nV\nIN\n= 3.6V, V\nOUT\n= 1.8V\nV\nEN\nV\nOUT\nt\nSS\nEnable\nThe 171010550 MagI3C MicroModule is enabled by setting the pin EN high. After setting EN high the module prepares for\noperation, a process which takes roughly 2ms. Once prepared, the module begins switching and the internal soft-start regulates the\noutput voltage rise until the desired output voltage is met allowing normal operation to take place.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 35\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nLAYOUT RECOMMENDATION\nThe picture above shows a possible layout for the 171010550 MagI3C MicroModule. Nevertheless, some recommendations should be\nfollowed when designing the layout:\n1.The input and output capacitors should be placed as close as possible to the VIN and VOUT pins of the device.\n2.The feedback resistor divider should be placed as close as possible to the FB pin.\n3.Pins 5 and 2 (EN and MODE respectively) must be always connected to either VIN or ground and they cannot be left floating\n(an example is shown in the layout depicted above, where EN and MODE pins are respectively connected to VIN and ground).\n4.Avoid placing vias in any of the pads for the module. Due to the small size of the pads, significant amounts of solder can be\npulled through the vias during heating, resulting in incomplete connections between the module and board. Therefore, vias\nplaced near the module’s pads should either be plugged or covered in solder mask.\nData Sheet version 3.0 ©May2022\nwww.we-online.com/powermodules 36\n171010550\nMagI3CPower Module\nVDMM - Variable Step Down MicroModule\nEVALUATION BOARD SCHEMATIC\nDesignator Description Quantity Order Code Manufacturer\nU1 MagI3C MicroModule 1 171010550 WE\nC1 Aluminum polymer capacitor 220µF/10V 1 875105244013 WE\nC2 Ceramic chip capacitor 4.7µF/16V X5R, 0805 1 885012107018 WE\nC3Ceramic chip capacitor 10µF/16V X5R, 0805 1 885012107014 WE\nCeramic chip capacitor 10µF/10V X5R, 0805(*) 1 885012005010 WE\nCff Ceramic chip capacitor 22pF/10V NP0, 0402 1 885012005009 WE\nRFBT 100k\n 1\nopen for V OUT= 0.8V 1\n402 k\nfor VOUT= 1.0V 1\n200 k\nfor VOUT= 1.2V 1\nRFBB 115 k\nfor VOUT= 1.5V 1\nSet VOUT 80.6 k\nfor VOUT= 1.8V 1\nby jumper 47 k\nfor VOUT= 2.5V 1\n32.4 k\nfor VOUT= 3.3V 1\nTo be soldered for adjustable output voltage.
